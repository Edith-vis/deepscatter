The architecture can automatically scale the resolution by monitoring in-band and out-of-band powers. The architecture performance was evaluated in a simulation UTRA-TDD environment. A power consumption analysis of the implemented architecture is also presented. The UTRA-TDD downlink mode was examined statistically and results show that the reconfigurable architecture can save an average of 74 percent power dissipation for TDD mode when compared to a fixed ADC word length of 16 bits. This will prolong talk and standby time in a mobile terminal.	cmos;image resolution;mobile phone;out-of-band agreement;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Aleksandar Stojcevski;Jugdutt Singh;Aladin Zayegh	2004	Proceedings.

d97972e901fc3fad9840b512fffb162c4fb94abb	a 0.45v sub-mw all-digital pll in 16nm finfet for bluetooth low-energy (ble) modulation and instantaneous channel hopping using 32.768khz reference		The current paradigm of frequency synthesis for short-range wireless transceivers, such as BLE, is to use a crystal oscillator (XO) in the tens-of-MHz range as a frequency reference (FREF) to phase lock an RF oscillator [1-4]. This ensures a sufficiently wide PLL bandwidth of tens to hundreds of kHz to quickly acquire a new channel and to suppress lower-frequency phase noise (PN) of the RF oscillator. The latter requirement can be alleviated by substantially lowering the flicker PN of a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) thus allowing to freeze its tuning word updates during receive (RX) packets and further directly FM-modulating the DCO during transmit (TX) packets [1]. However, an all-digital PLL (ADPLL) is still needed just to quickly settle the DCO to each new channel.	arnold tongue;bluetooth;crystal oscillator;device configuration overlay;digitally controlled oscillator;fm broadcasting;flicker (screen);frequency synthesizer;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;modulation;olpc xo;phase noise;phase-locked loop;programming paradigm;radio frequency;transceiver	Min-Shueh Yuan;Chao-Chieh Li;Chia-Chun Liao;Yu-Tso Lin;Chih-Hsien Chang;Robert Bogdan Staszewski	2018	2018 IEEE International Solid - State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2018.8310377	electronic engineering;computer science;phase-locked loop;modulation;phase noise;frequency modulation;digitally controlled oscillator;crystal oscillator;communication channel;bandwidth (signal processing)	EDA	60.34118265439678	55.5267435010358	182387

The compressed sensing method is directly used to sample and reconstruct multi-band RF signal in this receiver. The original signal is mixed with Bernoulli random signal, and then filtered by low-pass filter. As completing the multiple narrow-band signals recovery within broadband range, the sampling signal is reconstructed in the digital domain. In this study, a novel reconstruction algorithm is proposed, which is adaptive conjugate gradient pursuit multiple measurement vectors (ACGPMMV), to overcome the drawback of orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors (OMPMMV). Meanwhile, how to reduce the channel number of system required is also analysed, which will be reduce hardware costs. The shortcoming of limitation of sampling chip's analogue bandwidth in the parallel alternating sampling system is overcame, and the requirement of receiver bandwidth is achieved by using the lower rate sampling. In this study, the study is carried out by means of numerical simulations of multi-signals in the different system model. The conclusions illuminate the algorithm can get well-signal reconstruction results under the conditions of less channel and low sampling rate, and well-noise stability.	compressed sensing	Nan Yu;Xiaohui Qi;Xiaolin Qiao	2013	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2012.0086	computer vision;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering	Mobile	57.8671934399049	57.320376239276925	184200

IEEE 802.11ah is a new Wi-Fi protocol optimized for Internet-of-Everything (IoE) applications. Compared to other IoE standards like Bluetooth or ZigBee, its sub-GHz carrier frequency and mandatory modes with 1MHz/2MHz channel bandwidths allow devices to operate in a longer range with scalable data-rates from 150kb/s to 2.1Mb/s. Moreover, the use of OFDM improves link robustness against fading, especially in urban environments, and achieves a higher spectral efficiency. The key design challenges of an IEEE 802.11ah TX for IoE applications are to meet the tight spectral mask and error-vector-magnitude (EVM) requirements as for conventional Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11n/g), while achieving low power consumption required by IoE applications. The presented TX applies a fully-digital polar architecture with a 1V supply, and it achieves more than 10× power reduction compared to the state-of-the-art OFDM transceivers [1-4]. Without any complicated PA pre-distortion techniques as in [5], it passes all the PHY requirements of the mandatory modes in IEEE 802.11ah with 4.4% EVM, while consuming 7.1mW with 0dBm output power.	bluetooth;carrier frequency;distortion;low-power broadcasting;phy (chip);requirement;scalability;spectral efficiency;spectral mask;transceiver;transmitter	Ao Ba;Yao-Hong Liu;Johan H.

The data rate for systems operating using such channels, in the absence of a power-hungry decision-feedback equalizer (DFE), is limited by the lowest notch frequency of the channel. This brief proposes a multiband transceiver system to overcome this limitation by upconverting part of the data using an on-off keying modulation to avoid operating near the notch frequency and multiplexes it with the original baseband data. The transceiver system implemented in 45-nm low-power CMOS and shows a 10%-50% increase in data rate with a power saving of 5%-30% over a traditional broadband system employing a DFE in exemplary channels.	baseband;cmos;electrical connection;equalization (communications);key (cryptography);low-power broadcasting;modulation;multiplexing;on-off keying;pin diode;reflection (computer graphics);resonance;transceiver;uncompressed video;via (electronics);wire bonding	Shreyas Sen;Farshid Aryanfar;Carl W.

The radar system operates at S-band and employs stretch processing. Stretch processing helps a radar system to process wideband signals to increase its resolution, while relaxing its analog-to-digital converter's sampling rate requirement. The reported radar system exhibits a high dynamic range which enables it to be used in variety of applications such as surveillance systems. Furthermore, the radar system architecture comprises of multiple receiver channels which enable the radar to detect objects of interests at certain angular locations and reject jammers. The digital radar testbed was built using microwave components. Moreover, the radar system is integrated on a single die chip using IBM 180 nm CMOS process with a low power consumption, small form factor, and high performance.	analog-to-digital converter;angularjs;cmos;high dynamic range;image resolution;microwave;radar;radio jamming;sampling (signal processing);small form factor;systems architecture;testbed	Mansour Taghadosi;Yazan Al-Alem;Lutfi Albasha;Hasan S.

dd661d508be62f78fca3be36fc5ed22c671532c9	low-power wideband analog channelization filter bank using passive polyphase-fft techniques		Polyphase-FFT (P-FFT) techniques allow for low power implementations of high performance multi-channel filter banks by utilizing computation sharing like a standard fast Fourier transform (FFT). Additionally, it enables a longer “effective window length” than is possible in a standard FFT. This characteristic breaks the trade-off between the main-lobe width and the side-lobe amplitudes in normal finite impulse response filters. Thus, P-FFT techniques have been employed for the channelization of wideband input signals in high speed digital communication receivers. In this paper, we present a prototype analog P-FFT based filter bank in discrete time that is used to channelize wideband input signals so as to reduce the speed and dynamic range requirement of the ADCs. The four-channel I/Q prototype is implemented using TSMC’s 65 nm GP technology. Based on passive switches, the design operates at high speed, consumes low power, and offers high linearity performance. The measured transfer function shows >38 dB side-lobe suppression at 1 GS/s operation. The average measured IIP3 is +25 dBm differential power and the total integrated output noise is 208  $\mu V_{\mathrm{ rms}}$ . The total power consumption for the P-FFT filter bank (eight-channels total) is 34.6 mW (34.6 pJ/conv).	acoustic lobing;algorithm;cmos;channelization (telecommunications);coefficient;cognitive radio;computation;dbm;dynamic range;fast fourier transform;filter bank;finite impulse response;image scaling;linear phase;network switch;passive optical network;polyphase matrix;prototype;roland gs;switched capacitor;third-order intercept point;transfer function;window function;zero suppression	Hundo Shin;Ramesh Harjani	2017	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2017.2700792	fast fourier transform;polyphase system;dynamic range;transfer function;electronic engineering;control theory;finite impulse response;dbm;computer science;filter bank;wideband	EDA	59.173557412954054	55.480645555061464	189325

We propose an online RF self-measurement in Xilinx Zynq (Zedboard) with RF (AD-FMCOMMS1-EBZ) to measure the radio frequency (RF) quality, in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER), Image Rejection Ratio (IRR), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and Noise Figure (NF).

Due to the relatively low power level of the digital data and the interference suppression capability of analog FM, standard analog FM receivers can reliably recover the analog FM audio signal. To recover the digital data, an extended Kalman filter front end is developed that exploits the capture capability of analog FM to reconstruct and postcancel the analog FM component from the received composite signal. Simulations are conducted with artificial analog FM signals, suggesting that postcanceling schemes can provide higher data rates than their precanceling counterparts, at a lower transmission delay penalty but higher digital receiver complexity. For analog FM to digital signal power level ratios in the range of 30-50 dB, the postcanceler digital signal recovery appears fairly robust, providing digital signal-to-noise ratios of 2-7.5 dB. The corresponding uncoded bit error rates strongly depend on the power level difference between the host analog FM and the digital data signal. In particular, at 260 kb/s and E/sub b//N/sub o/=10 dB they range between 1% to about 15%, and can be reduced to acceptable levels using standard channel coding techniques.	digital data;fm broadcasting;simulcast	Haralabos C.

2100ec049cafe81915a24f6453cf4a53878f6e7d	modified polar sigma-delta transmitter for multiradio applications	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Radio transmitters capable of transforming variable envelope signals into constant envelope signals can be associated with highefficiency switched mode power amplifiers. One of the techniques providing this conversion is Polar Sigma-Delta (ΣΔ) architecture. This approach provides efficient solution for high-dynamic signals, and, moreover, it offers flexibility in a multiradio environment. The overall concept of the polar ΣΔ transmitter is presented here along with novel modifications and improvements. Namely, when recombining the envelope and the phase signals, it is suggested to replace the analog mixing by a digital mixing. The impact of a frequency synthesizer with a switched loop bandwidth and its imperfections on the overall polar ΣΔ architecture is investigated as well. The Mobile WiMAX standard has been chosen for validation due to very high requirements in terms of power dynamics and the variable channel bandwidth. Simulation results are presented in this paper, and advantages and drawbacks of this novel approach are pointed here as well.	amplifier;bandwidth (signal processing);circuit complexity;delta-sigma modulation;elegant degradation;frequency synthesizer;oversampling;phase noise;phase-locked loop;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;synchronization (computer science);transmitter	Martha Liliana Suárez Peñaloza;Václav Valenta;Geneviève Baudoin;Martine Villegas;Roman Marsalek	2010	EURASIP J.

This paper proposes a novel, compact but accurate body transmission channel model based on RC distribution networks and transmission line theory. The comparison between simulation and measurement results indicates that the proposed approach accurately models the body channel characteristics. In addition, the impedance-matching networks at the transmitter output and the receiver input further maximize the power transferred to the receiver, relax the receiver complexity, and increase the transmission performance. Based on the simulation results, the power gain can be increased by up to 16 dB after matching. A binary phase-shift keying modulation scheme is also used to evaluate the bit-error-rate improvement.	bit error rate;channel (communications);characteristic impedance;decibel;impedance matching;key (cryptography);modulation;power gain;quantitative impedance;simulation;transmission line device component;transmitter device component;replication compartment	Hao Wang;Xian Tang;Oliver Chiu-sing Choy;Gerald E.

This work explores the use of such methods for communications through tissue for potential biomedical applications, using the tremendous bandwidth available in commercial medical ultrasound transducers. While long-range ocean acoustic experiments have been at rates of under 100kbps, typically on the order of 1-10kbps, data rates in excess of 120Mb/s have been achieved over cm-scale distances in ultrasonic testbeds [19]. This paper describes experimental transmission of digital communication signals through samples of real pork tissue and beef liver, achieving data rates of 20-30Mbps, demonstrating the possibility of real-time video-rate data transmission through tissue for in-body ultrasonic communications with implanted medical devices.	acoustic cryptanalysis;coherence (physics);data rate units;experiment;medical ultrasound;offset binary;real-time clock;transducer	Andrew Singer;Michael Oelze;Anthony Podkowa	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2016.7536815	quadrature amplitude modulation;transducer;telecommunications;ultrasonic sensor;radio frequency;bandwidth	Mobile	59.95595966437956	59.972019765756656	197214

We assume the use of acoustic waves. Due to the Doppler effect, the communication frequency depends on the relative motion between the participants. We are interested in the Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) range, from 0.3 to 3 kHz. We relate the Doppler effect to the half-power bandwidth, versus distance. Numeric simulations are conducted. We show that the Doppler shift is significant with respect to the half-power bandwidth in the ULF band, for long distance communications.	acoustic cryptanalysis;doppler effect;frequency band	Abdel Mehsen Ahmad;Michel Barbeau;Joaquín García;Jamil Kassem;Evangelos Kranakis;Steven Porretta	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-74439-1_1	doppler effect;ultra low frequency;underwater;acoustic wave;bandwidth (signal processing);physics;electronic engineering	ECom	60.25807479423121	59.76951754185426	197685

In this paper, we propose an alternative parallel sampling scheme, which is based on random projection, for an ultra- wideband analog to digital conversion. The sampling rate by using proposed scheme can be reduced to 1/m Nyquist sampling rate where m is the number of parallel channel. Compared with conventional ADCs based on pulse code modulation (PCM), the proposed method makes the sub-Nyquist sampling possible. And compared with other parallel sampling scheme methods, it can be easy implemented without any apriori knowledge about the signal. And it is very suitable for sampling UWB signals with short time support. Additionally, the detail implementation structure, performance analysis and simulation results of proposed method are given.	analog-to-digital converter;apriori algorithm;boson sampling;mathematical optimization;modulation;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;profiling (computer programming);pseudorandomness;radar;random projection;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;simulation;ultra-wideband	Guangming Shi;Zhe Liu;Xia Yu Chen;L.
