In this paper, a systematic stochastic control design method is applied based upon a direct quadrature method of moments. In conjunction with a nonlinear robust control and offline optimization through nonlinear programming, any order of stationary statistical moments can be directly controlled. Compared with existing stochastic control methodologies, the advantages of the proposed method are 1) the closed-loop tracking system is asymptotically stable, 2) any (attainable) higher order steady-state moments of the state/output variables can be controlled, 3) the system is stable up to the order of the highest moment selected in the design, 4) the state process can be unknown and is not required to be Gaussian, and 5) no Monte Carlo analysis is required in the design. Two simulation scenarios of the X-33 3-DOF attitude control in ascending phase have been used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method, and the results are validated by Monte Carlo runs. Although the method is only evaluated in this paper in the attitude control of the reusable launch vehicle's ascending phase, the method will be applicable to a wider class of aero and space systems such as aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle, missile, and satellite attitude control.	aerial photography;euler;format-preserving encryption;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;noise (electronics);nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;online and offline;robust control;simulation;stationary process;steady state;stochastic control;times ascent;tracking system;unmanned aerial vehicle;utility functions on indivisible goods;windows aero	Yunjun Xu;Ming Xin	2011	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2011.5705662	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;engineering;control theory;mathematics;quadratic programming;statistics;monte carlo method	Robotics	61.66526879079314	-17.631188593809473	160567

Traditional planning methods by optimization, sampling or learning work well in planning for parallel grippers but remain challenging for multi-fingered hands. This paper proposes a strategy called finger splitting, to plan precision grasps for multi-fingered hands starting from optimal parallel grasps. The finger splitting is optimized by a dual-stage iterative optimization including a contact point optimization (CPO) and a palm pose optimization (PPO), to gradually split fingers and adjust both the contact points and the palm pose. The dual-stage optimization is able to consider both the object grasp quality and hand manipulability, address the nonlinearities and coupling, and achieve efficient convergence within one second. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation video is available at [1].

The robot grasps one end of the object and helps the human operator carry it at the other end. The proposed control method uses a virtual nonholonomic constraint. The movement of the object is constrained as if it were being carried on a wheel attached to the object. This method prevents the object from slipping sideways and simplifies the carrying operation. In spite of the constraint, the object can reach any position and orientation due to the nonholonomy. Cooperative manipulation in a horizontal plane is considered first, and then it is extended to 6-DoF manipulation in 3-D space.

Walking training programmes are stored in the walker so that rehabilitation can be carried out without a physical therapist. During walking training the forces imposed by the user’s arms to the armrest of the ODW decreased the path tracking accuracy. In a previous study, to address the issue, an adaptive control algorithm was developed to deal with the centre of gravity shift and the load changes caused by the users. However, the control parameters in the non-linear adaptive control law were manually adjusted. In this paper, an adaptive control strategy with automatic parameter adjustment by genetic algorithm is proposed. Simulations are presented to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	amiga walker;armrest;coat of arms;computer simulation;control theory;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;open desktop workstation;optimal control	Renpeng Tan;Shuoyu Wang;Yinlai Jiang;Kenji Ishida;Masakatsu G.

W e use the term “singularity-consistent (SC) approach in referring to any of them. The SC approach guarantees the direction of motion in the whole work space. Thus, it becomes possible to moue through singularities in telwperated mode, without producing an infeasible joint velocity. However, a precise command direction as needed to accomplish such a specific motion. In this paper, we propose a supporting system for the operator to handle the above problem.

An approach for fixed and mobile obstacle avoidance is proposed. The basic idea is to solve the redundancy as an unconstrained optimization problem where the redundancy is integrated with the path tracking and the obstacle avoidance constraints into an augmented objective function. Here, an iterative solution of the Inverse Geometric Model (IGM) is used, which requires no matrix inversion and iterates directly on the joint position, being thus suitable for on-line application and also preserving repeatability. A method of formulating anti-collision constraints using a novel concept of pseudo-distance unifies in a simple and original way the modeling of various obstacles.	obstacle avoidance;real-time transcription;robot	Véronique Perdereau;C.

Based onLagrange equations, dynamics of the inclined RTAC system is achieved by selecting cart position and rotor angle as the general coordinates and torque acting on the rotor as general force. The analysis of equilibriums and their controllability yields that controllability of equilibriums depends on inclining direction of the inclined RTAC system. To stabilize the system to its controllable equilibriums, a proper control Lyapunov function including system energy, which is used to show the passivity property of the system, is designed. Consequently, a stabilizing controller is achieved directly based on the second Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to verify the correctness and feasibility of our dynamical analysis and control design.		Bingtuan Gao;Fei Ye	2014	J.

In this method the manipulation strategy is determined based on on-line estimation of the operational force. We integrate these functions with a real-time controller that controls the external force and maintains full-body balance. The feature point of our work is that since a full-body control system includes switching of the manipulation strategy based on the operational force estimated on-line the system enables a humanoid robot to manipulate heavy objects as well as light objects. The effectiveness of our whole system is confirmed in our experiments, in which a humanoid robot manipulates up to 12[kg] while estimating the object's weight.	control system;experiment;humanoid robot;online and offline;real-time transcription	Shunichi Nozawa;Ryohei Ueda;Youhei Kakiuchi;Kei Okada;Masayuki Inaba	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5651652	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control system;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	66.65433043535889	-22.67079912659629	163467

This robustness is obtained b y updating the location of the nominal constraint model (the so-called “trackizg”) to make it coincide with the %eal-world” constraint model. The inputs to the tracking equations are selected components of the measured forces acting on the manipulated object, or of the object’s motion. This tezt derives a theoretical framework, based on the feature frame formalism, in which the tracking equations for any general motion constraint configuration are derived in a systematic way. On the one hand, the resulting equations are compared to previo w research, which applied intuitively derived tracking equations to simple constrained motion tasks, and, on the other hand, their applicability to complex tasks is shown.	online and offline;semantics (computer science)	Herman Bruyninckx;Joris De Schutter	1992		10.1109/ROBOT.1992.220037	identification;robot;control engineering;simulation;uncertainty;stability;computer science;control theory;mathematics;tracking;statistics;robustness	Robotics	67.380203927552	-21.13605714655345	164336
5b52dd1e32b809a4d255e5163ce6369a47ba2d83	an investigation on the usefulness of employing a two-segment foot for traversing stairs		In this paper, e®ects of employing toe-o® and heel-contact gait phases on the performance of bipedal robots traversing stairs are examined. The main goal is to demonstrate the hypothesis that employing toes and heels during walking up and down stairs improves the gait performance in terms of actuating joint torques and energy consumption. For this purpose, a comprehensive dynamics model for a 3D biped robot is developed and the inverse dynamics solutions during various walking phases are presented. To realize walking up and down stairs, a zero moment point (ZMP)-based pattern generation routine in the task space is proposed. In this routine, ̄rst, trajectories for the feet and the pelvis in the task space are designed to realize the desired task and preserve the feasibility constraints. Then, consistent with the topology of walking, suitable trajectory for the toe joint is generated. To examine the e®ects of heel-contact and toeo® gait phases, three walking topologies for walking up stairs and four walking topologies for walking down stairs, depending on the use of toe-o® and heel-contact motions, are considered. For these topologies, the optimization procedure is conducted to yield the optimal patterns. Finally, the obtained patterns are compared in terms of energy consumption and joint torques, while obtained results show a signi ̄cant improvement in the gait performance in terms of considered cost functions.	computation;inverse dynamics;las vegas algorithm;mathematical optimization;nl (complexity);navier–stokes equations;numerical aperture;robot;unified model;zero moment point	Mahdokht Ezati;Majid Khadiv;S.

A new estimation method of the unknown curve normal direction is proposed based on force and torque information. According to the method, the force control and position control directions of the hybrid force/position control can be estimated. The conventional proportion integration (PI) force control method is tested at first. Since the force PI control parameters are difficult to determine, fuzzy PI control is introduced to optimise the force PI control parameters automatically. According to the experiment result, the method can greatly reduce the contact force fluctuation during grinding wheel contact with part contour, and the contact force during estimating curve surface is in the desired range of ± 2 N. And during grinding procedure, the acting force fluctuation is in the desired range of ± 7 N.	algorithm;fuzzy control system;normal (geometry);quantum fluctuation;velocity (software development)	Tie Zhang;Wenbo Liu;Xiaohong Liang	2016	IJMR	10.1504/IJMR.2016.076984	classical mechanics;control engineering;normal;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control;fuzzy control system	Robotics	66.71386801888838	-19.76595126386492	164930

Series elastic actuators (SEAs) have been an efficient solution in the design of this kind of robotic application. Standard implementations of impedance control with SEAs require an internal force control loop for guaranteeing the desired impedance output. However, nonlinearities and uncertainties hamper such a guarantee of an accurate force level in this human-robot interaction. This paper addresses the dependence of the impedance control performance on the force control and proposes a control approach that improves the force control robustness. A unified model of the human-robot system that considers the ankle impedance by a second-order dynamics subject to uncertainties in the stiffness, damping, and inertia parameters has been developed. Fixed, resistive, and passive operation modes of the robotics system were defined, where transition probabilities among the modes were modeled through a Markov chain. A robust regulator for Markovian jump linear systems was used in the design of the force control. Experimental results show the approach improves the impedance control performance. For comparison purposes, a standard [Formula: see text] force controller based on the fixed operation mode has also been designed. The Markovian control approach outperformed the [Formula: see text] control when all operation modes were taken into account.	actuator device component;addresses (publication format);characteristic impedance;control system;controllers;human–robot interaction;limb structure;linear system;markov chain;nominal impedance;probability;quantitative impedance;rehabilitation robotics;robot;stiffness;unified model;electric impedance	Andres L.

We considered decentralized platooning, i.e., a virtual train of vehicles, where each vehicle is autonomous and decides on its motion based on its own perceptions. The platooning vehicles have non-holonomic constraints. The following vehicle only has information about its own orientation and about its distance and azimuth to the leading vehicle. Its position is determined using odometry and a compass. The reference position and the orientation of the following vehicle are determined by the estimated path of the leading vehicle in a parametric polynominal form. The parameters of the polynominals are determined using the least-squares method. This parametric reference path is also used to determine the feed-forward part of the applied control algorithm. The feed-back control consists of a state controller with three inputs: the longitudinal and lateral position errors and the orientation error. The results of the experiments demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm for vehicle platoons.	algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;feedback;lateral thinking;least squares;odometry;platoon (automobile);testbed	Drago Matko;Gregor Klancar;Saso Blazic;Olivier Simonin;Franck Gechter;Jean-Michel Contet;Pablo Gruer	2008			control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;least squares;feed forward;testbed	Robotics	63.367119879384944	-18.229585829084836	165886

The method combines iteratively refitted time-varying linear models with trajectory optimization, and can be seen as an instance of model-based reinforcement learning or as adaptive optimal control. Its appeal lies in the ability to handle challenging problems with surprisingly little data. We show that we can achieve sample-efficient learning of tasks that involve intermittent contact dynamics and under-actuation. Furthermore, we can control the hand directly at the level of the pneumatic valves, without the use of a prior model that describes the relationship between valve commands and joint torques. We compare results from learning in simulation and on the physical system.

a277c52da0ecc6be3bd5558eecca53e5bda75346	imprecise dynamic walking with time-projection control		We present a new walking foot-placement controller based on 3LP, a 3D model of bipedal walking that is composed of three pendulums to simulate falling, swing and torso dynamics. Taking advantage of linear equations and closed-form solutions of the 3LP model, our proposed controller projects intermediate states of the biped back to the beginning of the phase for which a discrete LQR controller is designed. After the projection, a proper control policy is generated by this LQR controller and used at the intermediate time. This control paradigm reacts to disturbances immediately and includes rules to account for swing dynamics and leg-retraction. We apply it to a simulated Atlas robot in position-control, always commanded to perform in-place walking. The stance hip joint in our robot keeps the torso upright to let the robot naturally fall, and the swing hip joint tracks the desired footstep location. Combined with simple Center of Pressure (CoP) damping rules in the low-level controller, our foot-placement enables the robot to recover from strong pushes and produce periodic walking gaits when subject to persistent sources of disturbance, externally or internally. These gaits are imprecise, i.e., emergent from asymmetry sources rather than precisely imposing a desired velocity to the robot. Also in extreme conditions, restricting linearity assumptions of the 3LP model are often violated, but the system remains robust in our simulations. An extensive analysis of closed-loop eigenvalues, viable regions and sensitivity to push timings further demonstrate the strengths of our simple controller.	controller (computing);emergence;high- and low-level;in-place algorithm;linear equation;programming paradigm;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Salman Faraji;Philippe Müllhaupt;Auke Jan Ijspeert	2018	CoRR			Robotics	62.98436243002815	-23.45444318828853	166346

The model takes into account the dynamics of the base that can potentially rock back-and-forth. Particularly, the model predicts the changes in the velocities of the manipulator links and the base due to impact with the ground. The application of the study is directed at industrial machines that cany human-operated hydraulic manipulators. The model is therefore used to simulate, for the first time, planar movements of a Caterpillar 215B excavator-based log-loader. The results clearly show the effect of the manipulator movement on turning the base over. The results also show that by proper manipulation of the arms, one can achieve a stable condition and even reverse the 'tipover' situation in such machines.	coat of arms;excavator (microarchitecture);simulation	R.

In this work we present a 10 cm long novel robot, SailRoACH, the first running robot that uses aerodynamic forces to turn. We present a scale analysis of aerodynamic steering, showing this steering method is most effective for small robots. Modeling and simulations were performed, and validated with experiments, that showed the robot is capable of stably turning in a 1.2 m radius at 1.6 ms-1. We also show that aerodynamic steering is superior for high speed turns at high forward velocity, compared to existing methods. Additionally, aerodynamic steering allows us to introduce a constant yaw disturbance to the robot. This is useful for studying legged locomotion, and is difficult to achieve otherwise.	experiment;robot;simulation;speedrun;steady state;velocity (software development);vii;yaws	Nicholas J.

Designing effective collision avoidance algorithm in dynamic sea environment is necessary for the navigation of USVs. This paper describes a collision avoidance system (CAS) with COLREGs compliance to improve autonomous navigational ability of USV. For small podded propulsion USV, a three-DOFs maneuvering model is established and the parameters of model are determined by the parameter identification method based on field experiments. About the COLREGs rules, the different maneuvering behaviors are summed up according to encounter situation and collision risk assessment. In the CAS, finite control set model predictive control is adopted, and COLREGs rules are taken as an evaluation standard in the quality function. Finally, the system is verified to avoid multiple dynamic obstacles and compliance vessel in the simulation and real environment, and the results of collision avoidance under four encounter situations are described in detail.	algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;risk assessment;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Xiaojie Sun;Guofeng Wang;Yunsheng Fan;Dongdong Mu;Bingbing Qiu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871725	collision;propulsion;collision avoidance system;distributed computing;model predictive control;control engineering;marine technology;computer science	Robotics	62.60117626752595	-17.602189015442256	168003

In contrast to the standard task Jacobian, the natural gradient follows the direction of steepest descent with respect to a parameterized model with extra degrees of freedom injected. This procedure enables NGC to maneuver smoothly in regions where the task Jacobian is ill-conditioned or singular. NGC efficiently estimates the natural gradient using only forward kinematics evaluations. This sampling-based algorithm prevents the need for gradient calculations and therefore allows great flexibility in the cost functions. Experiments show NGC can even use statistics of rendered images as part of the cost function, which would be impossible with traditional inverse kinematics approaches. The advantages of NGC are shown on the full 41-degree upper body of an iCub humanoid, in simulation and on a real robot, and compared to a Jacobian-based controller. Experiments show that the natural gradient is robust and avoids common pitfalls such as local minima and slow convergence, which often affects the application of Jacobian-based methods. Demonstrations on the iCub show that NGC is a practical method that can be used for complex movements.	algorithm;condition number;experiment;forward kinematics;gradient descent;humanoid robot;icub;information geometry;inverse kinematics;jacobian matrix and determinant;loss function;maxima and minima;new general catalogue;sampling (signal processing);simulation;smoothing	Marijn F.

This mechanism has higher dexterity than conventional six-degree-of-freedom arms, and allows the elimination of the internal singularities at the shoulder and the wrist. The contribution of the present work is to exploit redundancy to accomplish singularity avoidance and possibly recover the original PUMA design.

Many research achievements have been made in dynamic motion planning, but the externally applied loads are usually limited to the gravity force. Due to the increasing demand for generic tasks, the motion should be generated for various functions such as pulling, pushing, twisting, and bending. In this paper, a comprehensive form of equations of motion, which includes the general external loads applied at any point of branched tree structures, is implemented. An optimization-based algorithm is then developed to generate load-effective motions of redundant tree-structured systems for generic tasks. A highly articulated dual-arm human model is used to generate different effective motions to sustain different external load magnitudes. The results also provide a new scientific insight of human motion.		Joo H.

However, the computation of the ZMP position and the dynamic model is highly complex, and so requires a considerable time. Therefore, to eliminate complex computation, this work designs a new locomotion control system for humanoid robots, which yields walking gait characteristics that are similar to those of a human. Accordingly, the first goal of this study is to elucidate walking characteristics by measuring human motion during locomotion. It analyzes biped locomotion from the perspective of torque control at each joint. Because of the complexity of biped locomotion systems, a dynamic biped law cannot be realized by the direct application of modern control theory. Hence, fuzzy logic concept will be adopted in dynamic stabilization analysis and locomotion control. The fuzzy control is based on coordination control rules for dynamic stabilization that govern the actions of the biped robot link. The performance of the system is evaluated by making the biped walk on a horizontal plane surface and climbing up a flight of stairs. Experimental results are presented to confirm the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed fuzzy stabilization tuning approach.	chris sawyer's locomotion;computation;control theory;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;hill climbing;humanoid robot;kinesiology;mathematical model;performance tuning;zero moment point	Jonqlan Lin;Julian Chang;Shuen Lyu;S.

At the heart of our approach is the concept of affine invariance: Trajectories are deformed in order to avoid unexpected obstacles or to achieve new objectives but, at the same time, certain definite features of the original motions are preserved. Such features include, for instance, trajectory smoothness, periodicity, affine velocity, or more generally, all affine-invariant features, which are of particular importance in human-centered applications. Furthermore, this approach enables one to “convert” the constraints and optimization objectives regarding the deformed trajectory into constraints and optimization objectives regarding the matrix of the deformation in a natural way, making constraints satisfaction and optimization substantially easier and faster in many cases. As illustration, we present an application to the transfer of human movements to humanoid robots while preserving equiaffine velocity, a well-established invariant of human hand movements. Building on the presented affine deformation framework, we finally revisit the concept of trajectory redundancy from the viewpoint of group theory.	algorithm;humanoid robot;mathematical optimization;quasiperiodicity;the matrix;trajectory optimization;triple modular redundancy;velocity (software development)	Quang-Cuong Pham;Yoshihiko Nakamura	2013	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2015.2450413	acceleration;computer vision;mathematical optimization;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;trajectory;mathematics;geometry;affine shape adaptation;quantum mechanics	Robotics	66.28177862493558	-21.19077384025753	170638

Since the on-demand computation for different step lengths and different step periods is almost zero, it would be very useful to the real robot walking control. However, the stability of the generated trajectory is not considered. This paper proposes a cost function containing the term of Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) to guarantee the stability (in the sense of the ZMP) of the generated reference trajectory for real biped robots. The experiment verifies the effectiveness of the proposed cost function and the double generating functions method.	computation;loss function;mobile robot;simulation;zero moment point	Zhiwei Hao;Kotaro Asaba;Kenji Fujimoto;Yoshikazu Hayakawa;Akihiro Hasegawa;Qiuhua Zhang	2014	2014 International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Information Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)	10.1109/MFI.2014.6997707	control theory	Robotics	64.39317938012523	-19.507007532297724	170721

The problem is solved via an inverse optimal control problem where the parameter of optimization is a time along the movement trajectory that splits the longer trajectory into distinct “moves.” First, trajectories are generated using a “forward” optimal control problem; then, the match of these generated trajectories is optimized via a second, “inverse” optimization, which determines the appropriate point of segmentation. An analytical solution to this set up, its numerical implementation, and an application to real data are presented. A key novel contribution of this paper is the analytical derivation of first order necessary conditions for optimality. The segmented movements may populate a library of movement primitives in order for robots and automated systems to perform and interpret novel tasks.	closing (morphology);closing the loop;high- and low-level;kinesiology;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;population;robot;test set	Yu Sheng;Amy LaViers	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2014.6973914	trajectory optimization;computer vision;mathematical optimization;segmentation-based object categorization;control theory;mathematics;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Robotics	62.03315230015105	-20.553407303816204	170759

The task of the robot is to reach a specified end-effector position with high manipulability measure of the holonomic arm. The motion is planned in such a way to guarantee that mechanical and collision constraints are satisfied. To ensure fulfillment of control limitations a trajectory scaling approach in limited periods of time, when controls are close to constraints, is used. In order to obtain smooth controls a heuristic rule for choosing trajectory scaling parameter is introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by the computer simulations of the mobile manipulator consisting of (2,0) class nonholonomic platform and 3DOF holonomic arm.	computer simulation;heuristic;image scaling;mobile manipulator;robot end effector;workspace	Grzegorz Pajak	2017	2017 11th International Workshop on Robot Motion and Control (RoMoCo)	10.1109/RoMoCo.2017.8003901	collision;workspace;scaling;mobile manipulator;holonomic;heuristic;control engineering;trajectory;nonholonomic system;engineering;control theory	Robotics	63.90204865230249	-20.953801166986114	170897

0a8b2a40f120106c7e16bdece34e990c3837b113	walking pattern generation on inclined and uneven terrains for humanoid robots		This paper introduces a walking pattern generation method on an inclined terrain in both pitch and roll directions, and uneven terrain. The walking pattern generation method is based on a modifiable walking pattern generator (MWPG) which allows a zero moment point (ZMP) variation in real-time. As a navigational command set, a 3-D command state (CS) is defined, which consists of single and double support times, sagittal and lateral step lengths, and foot height of the swing leg. In the single support phase, the primary dynamics of the humanoid robot on the inclined terrain is modeled as a 3-D linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) with constant center of mass (CoM) height, and the dynamic equation of the 3-D LIPM is derived to obtain the sagittal and lateral CoM motions. Using the sagittal and lateral CoM motions, the sagittal and lateral CoM trajectories are generated to satisfy the sagittal and lateral step lengths of the swing leg. The foot trajectories of the swing leg are generated according to the commanded sagittal and lateral step lengths, and foot height. In the double support phase, the vertical CoM trajectory is generated to satisfy the foot height of the swing leg from the single support phase. The walking pattern generation method is implemented on a simulation model of the small-sized humanoid robot, HanSaRam-IX (HSR-IX) and the effectiveness is demonstrated through computer simulations.	computer simulation;hierarchical state routing;humanoid robot;inverted pendulum;lateral thinking;real-time locating system;zero moment point	Young-Dae Hong;Jong-Hwan Kim	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37374-9_21	humanoid robot	Robotics	63.94133833782686	-23.06366844392462	171859

Historically, Lawrence (1991) proposed the transparency-optimized architecture and passivity theorem for stability analysis of bilateral teleoperation. He claimed that unless the task(or environment) impedance contains a significant inertial behavior, passivity condition for transparency-optimized architecture can not be satisfied. To overcome this problem, we analyze and propose a method which can satisfy passivity condition for the micro-teleoperation system handling a small inertial object based on the structures originated by Lawrence and Hashtrudi-Zaad et al. (1999) and velocity-force scaling property of micro-teleoperation.

A torso is added to a biped walker; and hip actuators, instead of ankle actuators, are used. A numerical approach is used to find the optimal control trajectories. A comparison between the cost functions of simple feedback control and optimal control is presented. Next, springs are added to the biped walking model at the hip joints to demonstrate the advantage of hip springs in terms of energy cost and ground conditions. The comparison between the torque costs with and without hip springs indicates that hip springs reduce the torque cost, particularly at a high walking speed.	amiga walker;feedback;initial condition;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;torque	Terumasa Narukawa;Masaki Takahashi;Kazuo Yoshida	2011	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574710000354	computer simulation;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.43590750554372	-20.318144384894456	173475

a7c0082547bf71e9503a2d15284de2dd42bf7a56	dynamic walking on slippery surfaces: demonstrating stable bipedal gaits with planned ground slippage		Dynamic bipedal robot locomotion has achieved remarkable success due in part to recent advances in trajectory generation and nonlinear control for stabilization. A key assumption utilized in both theory and experiments is that the robot’s stance foot always makes no-slip contact with the ground, including at impacts. This assumption breaks down on slippery low-friction surfaces, as commonly encountered in outdoor terrains, leading to failure and loss of stability. In this work, we extend the theoretical analysis and trajectory optimization to account for stick-slip transitions at point foot contact using Coulomb’s friction law. Using AMBER-3M planar biped robot as an experimental platform, we demonstrate for the first time a slippery walking gait which can be stabilized successfully both on a lubricated surface and on a rough no-slip surface. We also study the influence of foot slippage on reducing the mechanical cost of transport, and compare energy efficiency in both numerical simulations and experimental measurements.

The controller computes a desired wrench (force and torque) required to recover the posture when an unknown external perturbation has changed the posture of the robot. This wrench is later distributed as forces at predefined contact points via a constrained optimization, which aims at achieving the desired wrench while minimizing the Euclidean norm of the contact forces. The formulation of the force distribution as an optimization problem is adopted from the grasping literature and allows to consider restrictions coming from the friction between the contact points and the ground.	algorithm;constrained optimization;experiment;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;poor posture;robot;simulation	Christian Ott;Máximo A.

Each robot is controlled to track its desired trajectory, while synchronized its motion with the two adjoining robots. A novel dynamic model of the WMR is derived based on Lagrange method. The Lagrange multiplier of the WMR is determined based on the input torques and the robot's velocities. The dynamic model has been divided into translational and rotational model. A synchronous translational controller is proposed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of both position and synchronization errors. A rotational controller is designed such that the robot always facing its desired position. A simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed synchronous controller in the formation tasks.	consensus dynamics;lagrange multiplier;mathematical model;memory controller;mobile robot;motion planning;optimal control;simulation	Ibrahim M.

d94c01193d7b3ae96bfc7128bfb94f95429f5173	kinodynamic motion planning for a two-wheeled drive mobile robot using a harmonic potential field		There are many methods for making a robot with two independent driving wheels move autonomously, but kinodynamic motion planning using HPF (Harmonic Potential Field) was seldom studied up to now. Since a nonholonomic system such as a robot with two independent driving wheels includes complicated nonlinear terms generally, it is hard to realize a stable and tractable controller design: in other words, it needs a specific control method when controlling it. However, about a dynamic control method in the motion planning, it is guaranteed that a nonholonomic controlled object can always be converged to an arbitrary point using a control method based on an invariant manifold. In this research, it is aimed at realizing kinodynamic motion planning for a robot with two independent driving wheels by combining the control based on the invariant manifold and the HPF. In this paper, how to combine the invariant manifold control and the concept of the HPF is explained in detail, and the usefulness of the proposed approach is verified through some simulations.	cobham's thesis;gradient;high performance fortran;microcomputer;mobile robot;motion planning;nonlinear system;quantum harmonic oscillator;simulation;time complexity;wheels	Kimiko Motonaka;Tsuyoshi Goto;Keigo Watanabe;Shoichi Maeyama	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793160	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;kinodynamic planning	Robotics	65.75492169112513	-16.95995063057999	174337

The collision effects on the motions of two coordinating robots are studied in this paper. At the moment of a collision, an impulse exerted on the two end-effectors is generated. This impulse will cause abrupt velocity-changes in robot motions. The direction of the impulse depends on the relative orientation of the end-effectors when the collision takes place. The magnitude of the impulse, on the other hand, depends on the relative velocity between the two end-effectors immediately before the collision, the joint positions, and the inertia matrices of the two robots. The minimization of the abrupt velocity-changes is discussed. The study reveals that to reduce the abrupt velocity-changes, the two coordinating robots must be symmetrical in all aspects, and the direction vector of the impulse must be an eigenvector of the Jacobian inertia matrix for the robot arms. Since the two conditions impose constraints on the robot trajectories, the approach of minimization is valid only when the two robot arms follow pre-planned paths.	coat of arms;jacobian matrix and determinant;robot;velocity (software development)	Yuan F.

Compliant joint drives can further improve the performance of legged robot systems by considerably reducing the problems associated with uneven or slippery footholds. Small changes of the foot position in uneven terrain are compensated by the passive joint compliance without the need for fast contact detection and controller responses while the mechanical tension is reduced. On rougher terrain with bigger elevations/depressions of the surface structure, however, a reliable ground contact detection and stance height regulation for each leg is required to distribute the weight of the robot evenly among the legs on ground during stance phase. This work presents a concept that allows the inherently compliant hexapod robot HECTOR to walk on uneven terrain and to overcome moderate obstacles by means of a decentralized walking controller. An important prerequisite is the availability of inherently compliant joint drives with an increased power/weight-ratio.	evasion (network security);hector;robot;singular value decomposition;star height;traverse	Jan Paskarbeit;Malte Schilling;Josef Schmitz;Axel Schneider	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139631	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot kinematics;foot	Robotics	67.68358467334734	-23.426366818055946	174390

Theoretical analysis is then given to show the relationship about the original MKE scheme at velocity level and its equivalent redundancy-resolution scheme at acceleration level, i.e., the so-called Zhang equivalence (ZE) relationship. Note that the ZE is in the iZ1eD1 manner, where i stands for the performance index and Z1 stands for using Zhang dynamics (ZD) once, while e stands for the equality constraint and D1 stands for using direct derivative dynamics (DDD or D3) once. Moreover, such two schemes are described/reformulated and unified as a dynamic quadratic program (DQP). Simulative results conducted on a robot manipulator (i.e., PUMA560 in this paper) further substantiate the effectiveness of the acceleration-level MKE scheme, and more importantly, the presented the ZE of such a MKE resolution at two different levels.	mathematical optimization;moore–penrose pseudoinverse;quadratic programming;robot;turing completeness;velocity (software development)	Dongsheng Guo;Xiaogang Yan;Long Jin;Hongzhou Tan;Yunong Zhang	2014	The 2014 2nd International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI 2014)	10.1109/ICSAI.2014.7009257	acceleration;mathematical optimization;simulation;trajectory;control theory;mathematics;redundancy;quantum mechanics	Robotics	67.01914628691297	-20.276090174443322	174701
85fa5582e248336f5ea81770b77bfa340dba1caa	mixed energy model for a differential guide mobile robot		Energy consumption is an important issue for mobile robots that carry a limited energy sources, like batteries, for a long period of time. An energy model can relate the kinematic movements of the robot with energy values, giving an estimation of the energy needed for the robot to fulfill a specific task. In this study an energy model is proposed, based on the dynamic parameters of the mobile robot, as well as the motors, given an energy value close to real energy consumption. Mixed energy model is tested with a well-known motor energy model, using the velocities related to straight and curvature paths as input. In the results, a higher energy consumption value is identified by the mixed energy model, especially when the acceleration of the mobile robot increases. Energy models are configured with P3-DX robot mobile parameters.	angularjs;autonomy;emoticon;mobile robot;real-time clock;scout;simulation;wheels	Mauricio F.

The simplified model of the bicycle with the balancer is derived from Lagrangian and nonholonomic constraints with respect to translation and rotation relative to the ground plane. We derived a controller using a steering handlebar and a balancer torque to stabilize the bicycle and we performed a local stability analysis of a closed-loop system by using the characteristic polynomial. The trajectory tracking control is derived by an input-output linearization approach to track the path in the ground plane. The proposed control algorithm is guaranteed to maintain bicycle stability even when the linear velocity is zero without requiring a secondary controller. Numerical simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	algorithm;autonomous robot;characteristic polynomial;control system;control theory;inverted pendulum;lagrange multiplier;linear model;nonlinear system;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Lychek Keo;Masaki Yamakita	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5281010	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.68800697604605	-17.40992145087168	175119

In order to alleviate this, we have so far proposed a design scheme for local sensory feedback control based on so-called discrepancy function that extracts the discrepancies between body (i.e., mechanical system), brain (i.e., control system) and environments. This paper intensively investigates the validity of this design scheme by taking a two-dimensional serpentine robot exhibiting undulatory slithering locomotion as a practical example. Preliminary simulation results derived strongly indicate that our design methodology allows us to endow the robot with highly adaptability and fault tolerance. These results obtained are expected to shed a new light on design methodology for autonomous decentralized control system. Furthermore, together with a validity verification of the simulation results, this paper introduces a real two-dimensional serpentine robot that is currently under development.	autonomous robot;discrepancy function;distributed control system;fault tolerance;feedback;simulation	Wataru Watanabe;Takahide Sato;Akio Ishiguro	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354268	control engineering;fault tolerance;simulation;computer science;engineering;control system;artificial intelligence;control theory;feedback;mechanical system	Robotics	67.81375294076253	-18.336150996647362	175498

It was also suggested that the reduced foot speed due to swing-leg retraction can help reduce impact energy losses, decrease peak forces, and minimize foot slipping. However, the extent to which swing-leg retraction rate influences all these benefits was unknown. In this paper, we present a study on the effect of swing-leg retraction rate on these benefits. The results of this study show that swing-leg retraction can indeed improve the performance of running robots in all of the suggested areas. However, the results also show that, for moderate and high running speeds, the optimal retraction rate for maximal disturbance rejection and stability is different from the optimal retraction rate for minimal impact losses, peak forces, and foot slipping. This discrepancy indicates an inherent tradeoff to consider when selecting the retraction rate for a robot control system: in general, retraction rate can be optimized for better stability and disturbance rejection or for more favorable efficiency, impact forces, and footing stability, but not all simultaneously. Furthermore, this tradeoff becomes more severe as running speed increases.	apex (geometry);control system;discrepancy function;human height;maximal set;rejection sampling;robot control;simulation;swing (java);velocity (software development)	J.

The idea behind the method is to move the space manipulator along a path with minimum dynamic disturbance. The method is proposed to use the manipulator Jacobian instead of the generalized Jacobian of the spacecraft-manipulator system. This is based on the simple fact that, if the space manipulator moves along the so-called Zero Disturbance Path (ZDP), the spacecraft is immovable. As a result, the space manipulator can in this case be treated as a terrestrial fixed-based manipulator. Hence, the motion mapping between the joints and the end-effector can be described directly by the manipulator Jacobian.

Compared with previous approaches, the presented method Is more general in that obstacles are allowed lo move nlth translatlon and rotation at non-linear velocity. Using pathhelocity decomposition, our method emphasizes the development of an efllcient algorithm for collision detection between the robot and moving polygons. This algorithm Is devised uslng traversabllity vector theory to determine the geometric relationships between any two convex polygons, or convex components of concave polygons. The Interference between the robot and the moving obstnclcs Is detected and reglslercd on the constraint map to represent tlme constraints on the robot's motion along the path. The conslrainl map is then used for velocity planning uslng a simple algorithm. The proposed method Is Implemented and analyzed.

Using a local coordinate transformation, the effect of the homogeneous solution of the potential energy matching PDE is isolated. By comparison of desired local linear dynamics with the parametrized linearization of the closed loop dynamics a set of linear equations for the IDA-PBC design parameters is derived. Besides the possibility to assign predefined dynamics the definiteness check of the potential energy can be omitted. With an Acrobot-type mechanical system the design steps are illustrated and simulations validate the performance of the approach.	hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hessian;linear equation;mass matrix;microsoft outlook for mac;nonlinear system;periodic boundary conditions;potential energy surface;simulation;underactuation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Paul Kotyczka	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160656	hamiltonian system;control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear control;coordinate system;potential energy;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;linear equation;mechanical system;symmetric matrix	Robotics	65.40097722227219	-17.16775065299148	176789

The method yields admissible input trajectories that drive both the manipulator and the platform to a desired configuration and is based on mapping the nonholonomic constraint to a space where it can be satisfied trivially. In addition, the method allows for direct control over the platform orientation. Cartesian space obstacles are also mapped into this space in which they can be avoided by increasing the order of the polynomials employed in planning trajectories. The additional parameters required are computed systematically, while the computational burden increases linearly with the number of obstacles and the system elements taken into account. Illustrative examples demonstrate the planning methodology in obstacle-free and obstructed environments.	automated planning and scheduling;cartesian closed category;computation;linear algebra;map;mobile device;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;polynomial;vertex (graph theory)	Evangelos Papadopoulos;Ioannis Poulakakis;Iakovos Papadimitriou	2002	I.

The UAV is equipped with a single downwards facing camera, and the motion control objective is the regulation of relative displacement and yaw to a stationary visual target located on the ground. The state transformation is defined by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) which eliminate roll and pitch rate dependence in the transformed image feature kinematics. A method for computing the general solutions of these PDEs is given, and we show a particular solution reduces to an established virtual camera approach. We treat point and line cases and introduce image moment features defined in the virtual camera image plane. Robustness of the control design is improved by accounting for attitude measurement bias, and uncertainty in thrust gain, mass, and image feature depth. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop is proven.

Because a jumping robot, in particular, requires both high torque and high velocity properties through the motion, a varying gear ratio is necessary. Moreover, it has to be optimally designed and realized. In this paper, we design a jumping robot with a non-circular gear that changes the gear ratio through the motion for the higher jumping. Based on statics, the gear ratio is optimized and change of the gear ratio is obtained by a simulation-based design considering the robot dynamics. So far, we have developed a design method of no-circular gear, and its effectiveness was evaluated by simulation. In this paper, a jumping robot is prototyped, and the effectiveness is evaluated by experiment containing the robustness for the perturbation of robot parameters.	experiment;optimal design;point of view (computer hardware company);poor posture;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Masafumi Okada;Yushi Takeda	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6697157	control engineering;simulation;gear;engineering;control theory;non-circular gear;robot calibration	Robotics	68.13546742145537	-19.72808336728116	178322

A combined adaptive and robust control scheme, consisting of an adaptive coordinated controller and a robust joint torque controller, is proposed to control simultaneously the motion of the object, the internal force among the robots, the contact force between the object and environment, and the joint torques. The proposed control scheme i s developed assuming that all system parameters, including the joint flexibility values, are unknown except for some of their bounds. Stability analysis of the control system shows that with the proposed control scheme, asymptotic motion and force tracking is achieved.

However, in order to achieve these goals, model based controllers are required. This work presents a new model based control approach, the stable Extended CTC, that uses extra data from additional sensors introduced in the passive joints of parallel robot in the controller. The proposed controller guarantees asymptotic stability, which is an important contribution over the previously presented approaches. The use of redundant information increases controller robustness and performance, allowing to reduce tracking error with respect to traditional CTC approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is demonstrated by implementing it in a Delta robot which has been modeled in ADAMS multibody software.	delta robot;optimal control;parallel manipulator;sensor;sensorization;stable model semantics	Pablo Bengoa;Asier Zubizarreta;Itziar Cabanes;Aitziber Mancisidor;Eva Portillo	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353816	control engineering;kinematics;parallel manipulator;simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;engineering;sensor;mathematical model;control theory;computational model;statistics	Robotics	66.29047558530883	-17.067470421123744	180116

We propose an optimality criterion that is adapted to linear inequality systems and characterize the resulting optimal sets at every priority level. We have successfully applied our method to plan local motions for the humanoid robot HPR-2. We will demonstrate the validity of the method using an original scenario where linear inequality constraints are solved at lower priority than equality constraints.	algorithm;humanoid robot;linear equation;linear inequality;linear programming;linear system;motion planning;optimality criterion;resolution (logic);social inequality	Oussama Kanoun;Florent Lamiraux;Pierre-Brice Wieber;Fumio Kanehiro;Eiichi Yoshida;Jean-Paul Laumond	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152293	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;linear system	Robotics	63.547240237280874	-21.14343339688809	180357

This measurement is adopted in several works but all of them are essentially calculated by enumerating over discretized directions of forces. Our proposed method does not need to discretize the direction, rendering the method more complete. The key idea of our method is that the measure is formulated as a function which depends on object vertices, disturbance force direction and hyperplanes of Unit grasp wrench space(UGWS). We proved that the reciprocal of this function is indeed concave over disturbance force direction, for a fixed object and fixed hyperplane of UGWS. Hence, we can derive analytical solution that find the global minimum of this function. A numerical example was carried out and the result shows that our proposed method can outperform the original computation in term of accuracy and efficiency.	algorithm;computation;concave function;convex hull;discretization;maxima and minima;minkowski addition;normal (geometry);numerical analysis;rejection sampling;sampling (signal processing);vertex (computer graphics)	Mana Borwornpadungkitti;Watcharapol Watcharawisetkul;Nattee Niparnan;Attawith Sudsang	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353686	mathematical optimization;central force;friction;control theory;resist;mathematics;geometry;torque;force;approximation algorithm	Robotics	64.36894175092677	-21.72163308747349	181056

A completely passive wing pitch reversal design based on the wingpsilas inertial dynamics is proposed. Dynamics are simulated using a Lagrangian formulation, resulting in theoretical predictions for aerodynamic forces and motion trajectory. Based on the generated wing lift and rotation trajectory delay, the wingpsilas sensitivity to variations in spring stiffness, damping coefficient, driving frequency, and rotation axis position is analyzed and the above parameters are evaluated for efficiency as control inputs. Furthermore, a wing control methodology based on slow actuation of spring stiffness and flapping frequency is proposed, allowing for partial position/orientation of the robot in free space.	aerial photography;apache axis;coefficient;control system;dynamical system;instability;position-independent code;robot;simulation	Veaceslav Arabagi;Metin Sitti	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4651003	damping;control engineering;aerodynamics;aerospace engineering;engineering;aeronautics;control theory	Robotics	65.69968970261746	-19.825303729196214	181314

Despite great advancements, no direct method is still available for finding switching points and constructing switching curve. All proposed methods are based on search algorithms, in which, one has to: -Search the whole phase plane to establish the boundary of non feasible area in which end effector can not follow the path. -Find the critical points by numerical calculation of the slope of the nonfeasible boundary. This paper is concerned with developing a direct method to find the critical points and construction of switching curve for cooperative multi manipulator systems. To this end, a rigorous study of the characteristics of the critical points and the switching curve is presented and based on that a direct algorithm is introduced.	bang file;coat of arms;computation;direct method in the calculus of variations;numerical analysis;robot end effector;search algorithm	Mohammad Hassan Ghasemi;Mohammad Jafar Sadigh	2008	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855308X294851	direct method;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;control theory;mathematics;critical point;search algorithm	Robotics	63.12439635083867	-20.43094397980087	181464

The new controller consists of three hierarchies: a center of mass (CoM) trajectory planner that follows a sequence of desired foot steps, a receding-horizon controller that optimizes the next foot placement to minimize future CoM tracking errors, and an inverse dynamics based full body controller that generates instantaneous joint commands to track these motions while obeying physical constraints. An approximate value function is generated by the CoM planner, and is used to guide the foot placement and inverse dynamics optimizations. The proposed controller is implemented and tested on the Atlas robot. It is capable of walking with strong external perturbations such as recovering from large pushes and traversing unstructured terrain.	approximation algorithm;bellman equation;darpa robotics challenge;inverse dynamics;mathematical optimization;obedience (human behavior);trajectory optimization	Siyuan Feng;X.

With the aid of a line of sight (LOS) fixed coordinate, the order of the system equations describing the three dimensional missile guidance problem is reduced to three. In addtion, the computational effort of solving SDRE is less than the usual guidance formulations which often have the order greater than three. Three different state dependent coefficient forms are proposed and compared under the consideration of optimality and implementation. For more constructive design, a simple shift of variable is also introduced to achieve better performance. From the results of numerical experiments, we also find that the proposed SRRE guidance law outperforms the conventional PPN guidance (for navigation constant equals 5) in the sense of time but at the cost of energy.	bellman equation;coefficient;computation;experiment;missile guidance;numerical analysis;secure digital container;smart data compression	Feng Tyan;Jeng Fu Shen	2010	IEEE ICCA 2010	10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524364	control engineering;three-dimensional space;navigation;simulation;optimal control;stability;missile guidance;aerodynamics;engineering;control system;trajectory;automation;automatic control;control theory;mathematics;numerical stability	Robotics	62.61974355190885	-18.791287624743095	181804

Unlike the work available in the literature that solves the problem using the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) the trajectory generation algorithm presented here considers a geometrical approach which is intuitive and easy to understand. This also computes the explicit solution for the length of the optimal path as a function of the initial configuration. Further, using a 6-DOF model of a MAV the generated optimal path is tracked by an autopilot consisting of proportional-integralderivative (PID) controllers. The simulation results show the path generation and tracking for different cases.

In order to predict unique lifting motion trajectories, a motion simulation model based on fuzzy-logic control is presented. The human body was represented by a 2-D five-segment model, and the neural controller was specified by fuzzy logic. Fuzzy rules were defined with their antecedent part describing the fuzzy variables of scaled positional error and velocity, and with their consequent part describing scaled angular velocity. These rules were generated according to certain trends in the fuzzy variable trajectories observed from actual lifting motions. An optimization procedure was performed to specify the parameters of the membership functions by minimizing the differences between the simulated and actual final postures. Simulations were obtained for 14 novel lifting motions from seven participants. Overall, results indicated that the presented model simulated lifting motions with an accuracy that was at least comparable to some previous human motion simulation models. The accuracy of the simulations differed between joints and was highest near the beginning and end of the motions. Strengths and limitations of the modeling approach are discussed. The use of fuzzy-logic control appears to be a fruitful basis for future simulations of lifting and other human tasks.	angularjs;computer simulation;fuzzy logic;kinesiology;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;logic control;mathematical optimization;motion planning;motion simulator;velocity (software development);well-posed problem	Xingda Qu;Maury A.

This allows 0-g emulation of a scaled spacecraft prototype under the test in a 1-g laboratory environment. The controller consisting of motion feedback and force/moment feedback adjusts the motion of the test spacecraft so as to match that of the flight spacecraft, even if the latter has flexible appendages (such as solar panels) and the former is rigid. The stability of the overall system is analytically investigated, and the results show that the system remains stable provided that the inertial properties of two spacecraft are different and that an upperbound on the norm of the inertia ratio of the payload to the manipulator is respected. Important practical issues such as calibration and sensitivity analysis to sensor noise and quantization are also presented. Finally, experimental results obtained from a robotic setup for spacecraft emulation with a milli-gravity accuracy are presented.	emulator	Farhad Aghili;Mehrzad Namvar	2009	I. J.

During the trajectory execution the fingertip force is decomposed into a dynamic equilibrating force and an internal interaction force. Using the equations of motion and the displacement consistency relationship of the virtual grasping system, a computational algorithm is derived for the dynamic equilibrating forces subject to the constraint of dynamic stability. To simplify the formulation, a representation of the internal interaction force components is developed. An objective function based on the fingertip forces is defined and the internal interaction forces are optimally determined. A computational algorithm for planning fingertip forces during trajectory execution is derived. >	robot	Gongliang Guo;William A.

We implement a leader-follower scheme, considering compliant contact between the object and the follower. Only the leader has knowledge of the object's goal configuration. The follower employs force/torque measurements to keep the contact stable and align itself with the object. The control scheme of the follower is based on the prescribed performance methodology guaranteeing thus the satisfaction of certain predefined force/torque constraints. In this way, the overall system acts as a perturbed version of the nominal car-like model. As a result, the leader implements a discontinuous control scheme, that drives robustly the system arbitrarily close to the goal configuration. No explicit data is exchanged among the robots, thus reducing bandwidth and increasing robustness and stealthiness. Finally, the proposed method is experimentally validated using two Pioneer mobile robots interconnected with a rod.	align (company);experiment;mobile robot;nominal type system;robustness (computer science)	Anastasios Tsiamis;Charalampos P.

In addition, the paper describes a computationally efficient technique that leads to a path typically having a peak force within 5% of the optimal path. In both cases, the equations used to define the robot’s motion are formulated after mapping the initial robot configuration, final (or goal) Cartesian location, and obstacles into a new space termed the center of mass (CM) space. This space has the advantage of being a Cartesian-like space that allows direct application of many existing control techniques, such as resolved rate control. In the CM space, a series of path segments guide the robot around the obstacles. Solving a system of equations based on these segments for boundary condition dependent constants determines the path. Currently, closed-form equations are unavailable for the boundary dependent constants, preventing exact determination of the globally optimal path. This paper introduces a five-step procedure for locating the optimal path. The final step uses a sequential quadratic programming technique to locate boundary dependent constants. The equation formulations assume that the initial configuration of the robot is known and that the robot mass and obstacle positions are constant during the maneuver. The method developed has direct applicability to redundant and nonredundant robots. A detailed example, based on a nonredundant robot avoiding a single obstacle, illustrates the concepts presented.	algorithmic efficiency;cartesian closed category;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;global optimization;maxima and minima;robot;sequential quadratic programming	William R.

These robots will need to be precisely controlled. However, factors such as manipulator joint/actuator friction and spacecraft attitude control thruster inaccuracies can substantially degrade control system performance. Sensor-based control algorithms can be used to mitigate the effects of actuator error, but sensors can add substantially to a space system’s weight, complexity, and cost, and reduce its reliability. Here a method is presented to determine the sensor architecture that uses the minimum number of sensors that can simultaneously compensate for errors and disturbance in a space robot’s manipulator joint actuators, spacecraft thrusters, and reaction wheels. The placement and minimal number of sensors is determined by analytically structuring the system into “canonical chains” that consist of the manipulator links and spacecraft with force/torque sensors placed between the space robot’s spacecraft and its manipulators. These chains are combined to determine the number of sensors needed for the entire system. Examples of oneand two-manipulator space robots are studied and the results are validated by simulation.	algorithm;control system;feedback;hall-effect thruster;robot;sensor;simulation;wheels	Peggy Boning;Steven Dubowsky	2011	I.

Free-flyer kinematics are developed using a minimum set of bodyfixed barycentric vectors. Using a general and a quasi-coordinate Lagrangian formulation, equations of motion for model-based controllers are derived. Two model-based and one transposed Jacobian control algorithms are developed that allow coordinated tracking control of the manipulators and the spacecraft. In particular, an Euler parameter model-based control algorithm is presented that overcomes the non-physical singularities due to Euler angle representation of attitude. To ensure smooth operation, and reduce disturbances on the spacecraft and on the object just before grasping, appropriate trajectories for the motion of spacecraft/manipulators are planned. The performance of model-based algorithms is compared, by simulation, to that of a transposed Jacobian algorithm. Results show that due to the complexity of space robotic systems, a drastic deterioration in the performance of model-based algorithms in the presence of model uncertainties results. In such cases, a simple transposed Jacobian algorithm yields comparable results with much reduced computational burden, an issue which is very important in space.	algorithm;barycentric subdivision;computation;euler;jacobian matrix and determinant;robot;simulation	Evangelos Papadopoulos;S.

514a54361e5baec0ca9693e045076a5fb4c4c68a	frequency-aware model predictive control		Transferring solutions found by trajectory optimization to robotic hardware remains a challenging task. When the optimization fully exploits the provided model to perform dynamic tasks, the presence of unmodeled dynamics renders the motion infeasible on the real system. Model errors can be a result of model simplifications, but also naturally arise when deploying the robot in unstructured and nondeterministic environments. Predominantly, compliant contacts and actuator dynamics lead to bandwidth limitations. While classical control methods provide tools to synthesize controllers that are robust to a class of model errors, such a notion is missing in modern trajectory optimization, which is solved in the time domain. We propose frequency-shaped cost functions to achieve robust solutions in the context of optimal control for legged robots. Through simulation and hardware experiments we show that motion plans can be made compatible with bandwidth limits set by actuators and contact dynamics. The smoothness of the model predictive solutions can be continuously tuned without compromising the feasibility of the problem. Experiments with the quadrupedal robot ANYmal, which is driven by highcompliant series elastic actuators, showed significantly better tracking performance of the planned motion, torque, and force trajectories and enabled the machine to walk robustly on ground with unmodeled compliance.	experiment;mathematical optimization;nondeterministic algorithm;optimal control;rendering (computer graphics);robot;robustness (computer science);simulation;trajectory optimization	Ruben Grandia;Farbod Farshidian;Alexey Dosovitskiy;Rene Ranftl;Marco Hutter	2018	CoRR		control theory;nondeterministic algorithm;control engineering;trajectory optimization;robot;actuator;optimal control;engineering;model predictive control;time domain;bandwidth (signal processing)	Robotics	62.17493800378658	-23.37508997805345	184193

A comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of the subsystems for this driving simulator under the proposed control scheme is conducted. The entire system dynamic is derived as a differential algebraic equation by treating the tire forces as fictitious inputs. The overall model is constructed as an artificial flat system with differential constraints. All the system variables and the constraints can be differentially parameterized analytically by the structure coordinates and their derivatives. A trajectory tracking controller is developed using flatness property. Furthermore, the desired trajectories are generated by motion cueing strategy based on model predictive control techniques incorporating all physical limits into the optimization process.	control flow;differential algebraic equation;driving simulator;mathematical optimization;optimal control;parameterized complexity;system dynamics	Zhongyi Gong;Ulrich Konigorski	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963077	vehicle dynamics;control theory;computer science;flatness (systems theory);control theory;control engineering;parametrization;differential algebraic equation;trajectory;model predictive control;driving simulator	Robotics	64.50268106533903	-16.916937884858143	184199

A sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the relationship between objectives, objectives and parameters, and allows to determine the functional meanings of the parameters. This resulting functional analysis enables to verify which parameters are relevant to the motor behaviors. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

af294371a6cff4f5b55ea53f56e25aca2d03e28c	generation of the whole-body motion for humanoid robots with the complete dynamics. (génération du mouvement du corps entier pour les robots humanoïdes avec la dynamique complets)		This thesis aims at providing a solution to the problem of motion generation for humanoid robots. The proposed framework generates whole-body motion using the complete robot dynamics in the task space satisfying contact constraints. This approach is known as operationalspace inverse-dynamics control. The specification of the movements is done through objectives in the task space, and the high redundancy of the system is handled with a prioritized stack of tasks where lower priority tasks are only achieved if they do not interfere with higher priority ones. To this end, a hierarchical quadratic program is used, with the advantage of being able to specify tasks as equalities or inequalities at any level of the hierarchy. Motions where the robot sits down in an armchair and climbs a ladder show the capability to handle multiple non-coplanar contacts. The generic motion generation framework is then applied to some case studies using HRP-2 and Romeo. Complex and human-like movements are achieved using human motion imitation where the acquired motion passes through a kinematic and then dynamic retargeting processes. To deal with the instantaneous nature of inverse dynamics, a walking pattern generator is used as an input for the stack of tasks which makes a local correction of the feet position based on the contact points allowing to walk on non-planar surfaces. Visual feedback is also introduced to aid in the walking process. Alternatively, for a fast balance recovery, the capture point is introduced in the framework as a task and it is controlled within a desired region of space. Also, motion generation is presented for CHIMP which is a robot that needs a particular treatment.		Oscar Efrain Ramos Ponce	2014				Robotics	63.516303616948065	-22.00523652729546	184879
d371bd2ab194f0085b4e183619fc93faf91334b9	dynamically consistent online adaptation of fast motions for robotic manipulators		The planning and execution of real-world robotic tasks largely depends on the ability to generate feasible motions online in response to changing environment conditions or goals. A spline deformation method is able to modify a given trajectory so that it matches the new boundary conditions, e.g., on positions, velocities, accelerations, etc. At the same time, the deformed motion preserves velocity, acceleration, jerk, or higher derivatives of motion profile of the precalculated trajectory. The deformed motion possessing such properties can be expressed by translation of original trajectory and spline interpolation. This spline decomposition considerably reduces the computational complexity and allows real-time execution. Formal feasibility guarantees are provided for the deformed trajectory and for the resulting torques.

In this work, we adopt a system-level perspective for the development of a rotary-wing micro air vehicle and propose a new design that utilizes gyroscopic dynamics for attitude control. Unlike traditional vehicles where attitude control moments are generated by aerodynamic control surfaces, the proposed vehicle will leverage the existing angular momentum of its rotating components to generate gyroscopic moments for controlling attitude. The capacity to rapidly generate large gyroscopic control moments, coupled with the precision gained from eliminating the need for complex and restrictive aerodynamic models, improves both agility and adaptability. We present the design and analysis of a new flying machine including the dynamic model with simplified aerodynamics and a control scheme based on a model linearized around hover. Simulations show the responsiveness and stabilization of a simple linear controller for hover.	adobe air;angularjs;computer simulation;fantasia;gyroscope;mathematical model;r.o.t.o.r.;responsiveness;robot;rotary woofer;software portability;stealth	Chris Thorne;Mark Yim	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980439	telerobotics;control engineering;vehicle dynamics;stability;gyroscope;aerodynamics;aerospace engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;angular momentum;attitude control;quantum mechanics	Robotics	66.8977932323132	-19.731408023819743	185110

The arm and rover are part of a network of collaborative robotic agents aiming to enhance current rescue operations by supporting human operators without burdening them with servicing tasks. The robust autonomy of the system, guaranteed in part through the addition of this robotic arm, is a main contributing factor. Design requirements are derived from the context of the rescue mission and a kinematic analysis is provided that leads to a customized design, including variable stiffness joints for compliant interaction with the environment. Experiments demonstrate the system's ability to perform the required Cartesian trajectory control and manipulation tasks, and to achieve a desired variable end-effector compliance.	aerial photography;cartesian closed category;experiment;mechatronics;requirement;robot end effector;robotic arm;rover (the prisoner);stiffness;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development);workspace	Eamon Barrett;Mark Reiling;Giuseppe Barbieri;Matteo Fumagalli;Raffaella Carloni	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8206327	control engineering;cartesian coordinate system;operator (computer programming);computer science;kinematics;robotic arm;stiffness joints;trajectory;stiffness;mechatronics	Robotics	65.01888264030808	-20.95921553449916	185190

The primary requirements are maintaining a formation that is subjected to environmental gust disturbances while holding either a fixed position or attempting to hold a reference velocity. The purpose of having both position and velocity hold modes is to have the performance of an aerostat while maintaining the ability to relocate as required by cell phone load usage. This paper examines the use of a predictive realtime control technique which solves an optimal control problem that takes into account minimum control energy, desired velocity, formation constraints, and control constraints. The control problem is reformulated as a linear programming problem for rapid convergence to a solution.

8fcfe55404d6dc3ff1d7da9f468e7855a8e55b24	inclined surface locomotion strategies for spherical tensegrity robots		This paper presents a new teleoperated spherical tensegrity robot capable of performing locomotion on steep inclined surfaces. With a novel control scheme centered around the simultaneous actuation of multiple cables, the robot demonstrates robust climbing on inclined surfaces in hardware experiments and speeds significantly faster than previous spherical tensegrity models. This robot is an improvement over other iterations in the TT-series and the first tensegrity to achieve reliable locomotion on inclined surfaces of up to 24°. We analyze locomotion in simulation and hardware under single and multi-cable actuation, and introduce two novel multi-cable actuation policies, suited for steep incline climbing and speed, respectively. We propose compelling justifications for the increased dynamic ability of the robot and motivate development of optimization algorithms able to take advantage of the robot's increased control authority.	artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;hill climbing;iteration;machine learning;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;reinforcement learning;simulation	Lee-Huang Chen;Brian Cera;Edward L.

The overall control architecture provides the possibility of changing the scaling factor of the mapping online, while preserving the passivity of the complete system. In our formulation, we use the port-Hamiltonian framework, in which energetic considerations play a determinant role for passivity and, thereby stability of the overall system.

However, these non-sliding contacts have not been considered in a single model. Here, by examining kinematics, we present a single model for both fixed and rolling contacts in a horizontal plane, and show that a fixed point contact is a special case of a rolling contact. We introduce a blind grasping algorithm with tactile feedback, and show that the algorithm does not require any tactile feedback in the case of a fixed point contact.

This is the first joint space interpolation algorithm to guarantee workspace error bounds on velocity and acceleration.

4122f0cc4d2e9bc16817904aff2cda05ff71c5f9	cooperative shared control driver assistance systems based on motion primitives and differential games		In this paper, a cooperative shared control driver assistance system that supports the driver in the steering task is proposed. The aim behind this concept is a cooperation between the driver and the assistance system. Thereby, both, driver and assistance system, can apply a torque on the steering wheel. Mathematically, this structure is described as a differential game. As a primary condition to facilitate cooperation, it is essential to explicitly regard the aims and steering actions of the driver for the calculation of the optimal torque, which the assistance system should apply. This requires an appropriate model of the human driver. A model that describes the driver steering motion as a sequence of motion primitives, which can be identified, is proposed for this task. Next, a real-time capable implementation of this concept is proposed. The concept is validated in a driving study. The study indicates that the system improves the lane keeping performance of the participants and leads to a higher user rating compared with noncooperative driver assistance systems.	real-time clock;real-time computing;steering wheel	Michael Flad;Lukas Frohlich;Sören Hohmann	2017	IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems	10.1109/THMS.2017.2700435	computer science;steering wheel;differential game;advanced driver assistance systems;simulation;torque;optimal control	Robotics	64.72889260780394	-22.742814160628186	187822

Our path planning method uses simple geometry of the vehicle kinematic model. The presented strategy consists in two parts: create a simple geometric path for the parallel parking in one or more maneuvers, formed by circle arcs and then transform it to a continuous-curvature path with the use of clothoids. Accordingly, a car-like vehicle can follow such path without reorienting its front wheels at stop. The proposed planning method is independent of the initial position and of the orientation of the vehicle. Control inputs for steering angle and longitudinal velocity are generated so that the vehicle can park by following them.	computer simulation;motion planning;velocity (software development);wheels	Hélène Vorobieva;Nicoleta Minoiu Enache;Sebastien Glaser;Saïd Mammar	2013	2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)	10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548775	control engineering;vehicle dynamics;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;automotive engineering;motion planning	Robotics	63.019066078459346	-19.424143253275403	188919

Assembly automation using robots has proven to be very successful. It has been shown that use of robots improves the accuracy of assembly, and saves assembly time and cost as well. SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) type robots have been widely used in industry for assembly operations in both the mechanical and electronics domains of manufacturing. One of the important issues in designing an optimal manipulator is the dynamic behavior of the manipulator which is highly non-linear and strongly coupled due to the interaction of inertial, centripetal, coriolis and gravitational forces. Although extensive study involving optimal time study, dynamic study using the Lagrange method, path planning etc. have been made, no closed solution for the dynamics of this important robot has been reported. This paper presents the study of kinematics and dynamics of the SCARA assembly robot. Closed solutions for the dynamics of this robot are derived. To study the variations of the torques of the links a computer code is developed. It is found that the torque is independent of the angular position, which makes the robot highly compliant.	angularjs;assembly language;autonomous system (internet);motion planning;nonlinear system;robot;robotics;scara;torque;time and motion study	Sisir K.

In particular, we propose a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme that guarantees the navigation of the object to a desired pose in a bounded workspace with obstacles, while complying with certain input saturations of the agents. Moreover, the proposed methodology ensures that the agents do not collide with each other or with the workspace obstacles as well as that they do not pass through singular configurations. The feasibility and convergence analysis of the NMPC are explicitly provided. Finally, simulation results illustrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.	coefficient;experiment;nonlinear system;real-time transcription;robot;simulation;singularity project;workspace	Alexandros Nikou;Christos K.

Decoupling vector fields allow us to plan motions for the underactuated dynamic system as if it were kinematic, and rest-to-rest paths are the concatenation of integral curves of the decoupling vector fields. These paths can then be time-scaled according to actuator limits to yield fast trajectories. Switches between decoupling vector fields must occur at zero velocity, so, to find fast trajectories, we wish to find paths minimizing the number of switches. In this paper, we solve the minimum-switch path-planning problem for the snakeboard. We consider two problems: 1) finding motion plans achieving a desired position and orientation of the body of the snakeboard and 2) the full problem of motion planning for all five configuration variables of the snakeboard. The first problem is solvable in closed form by geometric considerations, while the second problem is solved by a numerical approach with guaranteed convergence. We present a complete characterization of the snakeboard's minimum-switch paths.	computational complexity theory;concatenation;coupling (computer programming);decision problem;dynamical system;image scaling;mathematical optimization;motion planning;network switch;numerical analysis;probabilistic roadmap;recursion;regular expression;robot;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);smoothing;underactuation;velocity (software development)	Stefano Iannitti;Kevin M.

The endogenous configuration space approach has been exploited as a source of conceptual guidelines. The new inverse guarantees a decoupling of the motion in the operational space from the forces exerted in the endogenous configuration space and annihilated by the dual Jacobian inverse. A performance study of the new Jacobian inverse as a tool for motion planning is presented.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;computer simulation;jacobian matrix and determinant;motion planning	Joanna Ratajczak;Krzysztof Tchon	2016	Int.

b89df09f80134b81dc31451128f364c7063f4c72	linear model predictive movement control with obstacle avoidance for an inverted pendulum robot		This paper presents a movement control methodology with obstacle avoidance control for personal robots that can work alongside humans. The methodology attempts to secure safety for users and stability of robots. These safety and stability are very important parameters in designing personal robot, and the personal robot controller must consider these parameters. The proposed approach uses model predictive control (MPC) that is a suitable control technique to achieve safety and stability whenever the robot avoids obstacles. Furthermore, the personal robot in this study interacts with people. In this study, we adequately select a two-wheel inverted pendulum (IP) type robot. The proposed controller can continue to secure safety and stability by imposing additional constraints on the robot coping with obstacles. To achieve this function, the proposed controller has the functions to control multi variables such as distance, velocity, turn-angle, tilt-angle and so on, in same time under some constraints on controlled objects. The proposed controller has time-varying constraints in relation to velocity for ensuring safety on obstacle avoidance motion by only turn­angle control. In addition, it has also time-invariant constraints on the controller input and body tilt angle for stability. Finally, the simulation validation results from a movement control with obstacle avoidance for an IP robot.

The closed-loop dynamic equation with the explicit force controller and the damping force controller are first derived. Stability analysis is then carried out by computing the system eigenvalues. Results indicate a conditionally stable system. Due to the presence of discontinuous contacts with the environment during the interaction process, the system exhibits a stable limit cycle when the force feedback gain goes beyond the critical value.

The planning problem has four types of constraints: collision-free conditions, structural joints movable ranges, joints velocity limits and actuators input limits. This problem is formulated using artificial potentials which give feasible joint movements under these constraints. An algorithm using the linear programming is given to solve the problem. This algorithm enables the successive adjustment of the weighting factors of artificial potentials and gives the desired joint trajectories. The algorithm is effectively applied to the planar movements of a manipulator with four links and four degrees of freedom.	algorithm;linear programming;planar (computer graphics);velocity (software development)	Hiroaki Ozaki;Akira Mohri	1986	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574700009346	robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;motion;manipulator;control theory;constraint;robotics;collision	Robotics	63.36444628187915	-21.229124402241933	192571

Impedance control can be employed as an approach for achieving compliant motion in such tasks. This paper describes a position-based impedance controller that has been developed in our laboratory for excavator-type manipulators, and presents supporting experimental results. First, the problem of impedance control for a single hydraulic cylinder is addressed and a method is presented to analyze the system stability. The steady-state position and force tracking accuracy of the closed-loop system is also studied. Next, the problem of impedance control for a multilink hydraulic excavator is addressed and the arm Jacobian and accurate estimates of the arm inertial terms are employed to map the desired impedance of the end-effector (bucket of the excavator) onto the hydraulic cylinders. Various contact experiments carried out using an instrumented mini-excavator demonstrate that the proposed impedance controller has very good performance for both single-link and multilink cases.	characteristic impedance;cylinder-head-sector;excavator (microarchitecture);experiment;jacobian matrix and determinant;nominal impedance;point-to-point protocol;robot end effector;steady state	Shahram Tafazoli;Septimiu E.

The complex kinematic structure of the mechanism is lumped into a single rigid body, B, with a variable center of mass. Inertial forces generated by moving parts of the mechanism are lumped into a neighborhood of wrenches centered at the nominal gravitational wrench. The identification of the robust equilibrium postures associated with a given set of contacts is reduced to the identification of center-of-mass locations that maintain equilibrium of B with respect to any wrench in the given neighborhood. The static response of B to an external wrench involves static indeterminacy and frictional constraints. The region of center-of-mass locations that generate equilibrium with respect to a particular external wrench is formulated as a linear programming problem, and a full graphical characterization is provided. The result is then generalized to robust equilibrium postures that resist a neighborhood of external wrenches. Finally, we present experimental results that validate the criteria for feasible equilibrium postures.	graphical user interface;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;linear programming	Yizhar Or;Elon D.

Planning is performed in the configuration (joint) space by the use of optimised combined polynomial splines, along with a search technique to identify the best minimum-time trajectory. The method proposed considers all physical and dynamical limitations inherent in the manipulator design, in addition to any geometric path constraints. Meeting the demands of the heavy computations involved lead to a distributed formulation on a multiprocessor system, for which an intelligent control unit has been created to supervise its proper and practical implementation.

This phenomenon is not merely a numerical artifact: it is symptomatic of an underlying property of the mechanism itself that can make it more difficult to simulate or control. This paper investigates the problem by means of an empirical study of the eigenvalues, eigenvectors and condition number of the joint-space inertia matrix. It is shown that the condition number is typically large, and that it grows anywhere from O(N) to O(N ) with the number of bodies in the system. Several graphs are presented showing how the condition number varies with configuration, the number of links, variations in link sizes, variations in connectivity, and fixed or floating bases. Explanations are offered for some of the observed effects.	backup;condition number;control system;euclidean distance;kinematic chain;numerical analysis;robot;robotic arm;side effect (computer science);simulation	Roy Featherstone	2004	I.

1a6807db35921128da92e0fa429597cec1bba4ca	a model-based hierarchical controller for legged systems subject to external disturbances		Legged robots have many potential applications in real-world scenarios where the tasks are too dangerous for humans, and compliance is needed to protect the system against external disturbances and impacts. In this paper, we propose a model-based controller for hierarchical tasks of legged systems subject to external disturbance. The control framework is based on projected inverse dynamics controller, such that the control law is decomposed into two orthogonal subspaces, i.e., the constrained and the unconstrained subspaces. The unconstrained component controls multiple desired tasks with impedance responses. The constrained space controller maintains the contact subject to unknown external disturbances, without the use of any force/torque sensing at the contact points. By explicitly modelling the external force, our controller is robust to external disturbances and errors arising from incorrect dynamic model information. The main contributions of this paper include (1) incorporating an impedance controller to control external disturbances and allow impedance shaping to adjust the behaviour of the motion under external disturbances, (2) optimising contact forces within the constrained subspace that also takes into account the external disturbances without using force/torque sensors at the contact locations. The techniques are evaluated on the ANYmal quadruped platform under a variety of scenarios.

Then, we develop a transformation method from a discrete control input into a continuous zero-order hold input based on discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. Finally, we show numerical simulations, and it turns out that our new method can generate a stable gaits on a periodically unlevel ground for the CCBR.	case-based reasoning;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;robot;sequential quadratic programming;simulation;zero-order hold	Tatsuya Kai;Takeshi Shintani	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2012.6402726	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.68949395996015	-19.013670932980286	199157

It is assumed that the object will be in contact with a constrained environment through an assembly process. The contact force between each robot and the object is decomposed into two independent forces, one of which is for grasping the object, and the other is for motion of the object. The object position and its contact force with the environment of unknown stiffness is controlled using a robust adaptive control algorithm. The Lyapunov's direct method is used in design and stability analysis of the proposed controller. Simulation results, confirm the performance and effectiveness of the proposed controller.	algorithm;consensus dynamics;direct method in the calculus of variations;lyapunov fractal;simulation	Reza Mohajerpoor;Seyed Mehdi Rezaei;Heidar Ali Talebi;Reza Monfaredi	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181278	direct method;control engineering;motion control;dynamics;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;stability;sliding mode control;adaptive control;engineering;control theory;force	Robotics	66.75580941299451	-21.59135412860978	199379

A matrix method was used in computations. Presented algorithm was used in trajectory planning. Joint values are chosen from a given set of solutions. A graph of solutions is made. Nodes represent the solutions of inverse kinematics problem and arcs’ weight are the cost of transition between two configurations. Two criteria are proposed in order to obtain smooth motion with desired properties. Algorithm based on derived formulas and logical conditions has been implemented in Adept SmartController CX. A comparison between manufacturer’s and proposed algorithm is presented. Proposed solution of inverse kinematics problem allows for a smooth passage through singular points.	robot	Tadeusz Szkodny;Adrian Legowski	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22876-1_27	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	62.951735016420706	-20.956564025423983	199925

The consideration of the effect of rolling and slipping of the fingertips at the contact points on the object surface leads to a set of linear differential equations for the joint angles and to a partly nonlinear optimization problem for the joint torques solved by the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm. The removal of redundant information reduces the computational effort to about 40% of the operations required for the standard procedure. Especially, the resulting object motions are demonstrated at an example: the rotation of an ellipsoid object with the fingers of the Karlsruhe dextrous hand. >	computation	Günter Wöhlke	1994		10.1109/IROS.1994.407494	control engineering;simulation;nonlinear programming;engineering;linear differential equation;control theory;quantum mechanics	Robotics	67.80597427847653	-21.994491830754882	199969

Thus, good precision requires good knowledge of robot physical parameter values. However, this condition can be difficult to meet in practice. Hence, calibration techniques can be devised in order to improve the robot accuracy through estimation of these particular parameters. In this article, the genetic algorithm is used to calibrate the robot kinematics accuracy. A kinematics model is formulated and conducted as an optimisation problem for ABB Irb 6000 robot manipulator. The objective is to analyse and evaluate the performance of the GA in optimising such robot kinematics accuracy. In this algorithm, small changes in the kinematics parameters values represent the parent and offspring population and the end-effector error represents the fitness functions. A numerical example has been used to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the given model.	genetic algorithm	Kesheng Wang	2009	Int. J.
