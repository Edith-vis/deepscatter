3b4a8a3dd23e9c53bd9070ff79aa40c5d0822057	a physical model of novel uv and blue-extended photodetector based on cmos process	cmos process;uv and blue extended;physical model;photodetector	An improved type device serving as a photodiode for an ultraviolet and infrared (UV-IR) complementary photodetector is presented in this paper, which can be applied for ultraviolet (UV)/blue detection. The device has been modeled and some critical parameters of this new structure (such as spectral responsivity, breakdown voltage) have been derived and simulated. Simulation results by this model are shown that the UV photodiode area has to be 15 times-smaller than that of IR photodiode, which can effective offset parasitic current generated by the UV photodiode when the light irradiation for IR. A dark current of 3×10-11 A at a voltage of 0V and the breakdown voltage of the UV-IR photodetector is about 14.1 volts. The photomutiplication gain rapidly increases with applied voltage when the photodetector is illuminated with μw 400nm light.	cmos;dark current (physics);simulation;stellar classification;uv mapping	Xiangliang Jin;Manfang Tian;Zhenyu Jiang;Han Wang	2015	2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)	10.1109/ASICON.2015.7516947	materials science;electronic engineering;optoelectronics;optics;photodetector	EDA	64.26719181092459	56.06107729551276	180600

Over the 54 to 862 MHz ultra wideband, the in-band harmonic distortions of the transmitter and the unwanted harmonic mixing of the receiver are effectively suppressed by exploiting the dual-path direct-conversion architecture. A seamless coverage of the full band is achieved by employing a fractional-N PLL with a single LC VCO and a multi-modulus LO generator. Implemented in 0.18 µm CMOS, the receiver achieves 110 dB gain dynamic range, ≪ 8.5 dB noise figure, and ≫ −11 dBm IIP3 at the LNA bypass mode. The transmitter delivers −3 dBm output power with OP1dB and OIP3 greater than +6.4 dBm and +15.9 dBm, respectively. On-chip calibration circuits suppress the image and carrier leakage components below −41 dBc across the total band.	cmos;carrier wave;cognitive radio;dbm;distortion;dynamic range;launch numerical aperture;modulus robot;noise figure;performance;phase-locked loop;seamless3d;spectral leakage;television channel frequencies;third-order intercept point;transceiver;transmitter;ultra-wideband;voltage-controlled oscillator	Jongsik Kim;Seung Jun Lee;Seungsoo Kim;Jong Ok Ha;Junki Min;Yun Seong Eo;Hyunchol Shin	2009	2009 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference	10.1109/CICC.2009.5280852	chip;cognitive radio;dynamic range;electronic engineering;telecommunications;gain;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;ultra-wideband;total harmonic distortion;cmos;radio frequency;transceiver	EDA	62.22251557435445	54.30144470465096	181232

This allows us to design efficient planar antennas, coupled resonator impedance matching networks and low-power rectifiers in standard CMOS technologies (0.5-mum and 0.18-mum) and accurately predict their performance. Experimental results from a prototype power extraction system that operates around 950 MHz and integrates these components together are presented.

This paper describes a highly integrated RF frontend module for high SHF wide-band massive MIMO in 5G. The RF frontend module is designed with 0.15 µm GaAs process and assembled on 5 × 5 mm2 QFN package. By employing Doherty amplifier configuration using a parasitic output capacitance neutralization technique, it achieves low power consumption over wide frequency band. The integrated frontend architecture is an attractive solution for massive MIMO systems in 5G, and will contribute to 5G deployment. Additionally, the use of digital techniques is attractive future option beyond 4G (toward 5G), and amplifiers with them potentially lead to reduction of power consumption.

a9015d1874364878b9282afbc516c31eae29554a	high-selectivity tunable balanced bandpass filter with constant absolute bandwidth	high selectivity tunable bandpass filter bpf balanced bpf constant absolute bandwidth abw common mode cm suppression;band pass filters resonant frequency passband microwave filters tuning couplings varactors	This brief presents a new and effective approach for designing a high-selectivity tunable balanced bandpass filter (BPF) with constant absolute bandwidth (ABW). The filter is composed of two open-loop resonators with a pair of symmetrically loaded varactor diodes to obtain tunable responses. The major design concept relies on choosing the particular position on the resonator for loading the varactor diodes. The desired variation slopes of the external quality factor and coupling coefficient can be easily obtained for realizing the constant ABW of the tunable BPF. Frequency-dependent source-load coupling between the feed lines are introduced for realizing two adaptive transmission zeros (TZs) on both sides of the tunable passband. Thus, during the frequency-tuning process, high selectivity of the proposed filter can be kept. Meanwhile, the common-mode suppression is optimized to an acceptable level in the frequency-agile range of the differential-mode passband by loading the stub and resistor in the series at the center of the resonator. For demonstration, a tunable balanced BPF with the constant ABW and two TZs is designed and implemented. The simulated and measured results are presented, showing good agreement.	abandonware;agile software development;coefficient;coupling constant;dependent source;diode;effective method;microwave;noise reduction;rejection sampling;selectivity (electronic);simulation;transmission (bittorrent client);transmission line;zero suppression	Wen-Jun Zhou;Jianxin Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2016.2621120	electronic engineering;computer science;control theory	Visualization	65.61002321794392	53.68437940906786	183706

The setup uses a different cell antenna placement strategy where there is one base-station antenna per cell located high at its center. Unlike a traditional base-station antenna radiating in the horizontal direction, the antenna under consideration radiates downward. The beamwidth of the antenna is considered to be wide enough to match the cell diameter. In addition, the radiation pattern beyond the associated beamwidth is assumed to possess a large attenuation. This paper studies the use of the proposed antenna setup by examining the cell geometry and grouping and its effect on the antenna radiation pattern. It is shown that for a sufficiently large attenuation pattern beyond the antenna beamwidth, the corresponding signal-to-interference ratio can be made significantly larger than the one resulting from the traditional antenna setup	cell (microprocessor);interference (communication);radiation pattern	Samer S.

A multibeam SAR system requires a set of secondary beams, implementing some additional features. To protect the SAR operation from possible jammers ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasure) capabilities can be implemented requiring an auxiliary beam which cover the portion of main pattern to be protected. A possible architecture of this secondary antenna system is here presented by using a set of radiating elements combined together to obtain the ECCM channel. To minimize the feeding network complexity and to maximize the system reliability, the ECCM antenna is a cluster of circular corrugated horns, eventually realized as a single-block unit.

f603609a7f6abb2fbbfde8b36d6181bfd3a55cba	a miniaturized invasive antenna study for a better performance in medical application		Today with the development of Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and the miniaturization of electronic devices, the use of implantable antennas for therapeutic purposes became a reality. However, the design of antennas in the context of WBAN still suffers from some shortcomes mainly in terms of matching. In this paper, a miniaturized slotted rectangular Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) was proposed for WBAN Medical Implantable Communication Services (MICS) band. The antenna was positioned in a chest model in the context of a cardiac activity monitoring. The PIFA was implanted at 11 positions within the muscle to observe its characteristics and its relative response. The main objective of the proposed approach is to get a miniaturized antenna and to find the most appropriate location for its operation. The fat thickness was varied in order to detect its influence on the antenna characteristics. A comparative study was carried out between our antenna and others suggested in the state-of-the-art. The obtained results show a good performance of the proposed small-sized PIFA of 11.9 x 14.7 x 1.305 mm3, equivalent to 0.0159 λ0 x 0.0197 λ0 x 0.00175 λ0.	bandwidth (signal processing);characteristic impedance;embedded system;file allocation table;inverted-f antenna;radiation pattern;return loss;thickness (graph theory)	Amal Bouazizi;Ghada Zaibi;Mounir Samet;Abdennaceur Kachouri	2018	2018 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA)	10.1109/WAINA.2018.00070	computer science;computer network;miniaturization;electronics;reflection coefficient;body area network;bandwidth (signal processing);planar;electrical engineering	Mobile	67.6487380899422	59.174375355744786	186310

The reconfigurability of the NoC is analyzed using a circuit co-simulation technique with a 3D finite element method (FEM) based full-wave electro-magnetic analysis of the antennas. The die and the circuits are modeled according to a typical complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. It is shown that, it is possible to have 1) at least two different frequency domains for the signal sources and 2) the dynamic switching of the signal sinks between the two frequency domains, with minimal design and area overhead.

cb52780c0f11327897272f796e9cb12655e83bee	flattened optical multicarrier generation technique for optical line terminal side in next generation wdm-pon supporting high data rate transmission		A novel and cost effective optical multicarrier (OMC) generator is introduced in this article. OMC is generated by connecting three modulators in cascade with laser source, where laser is connected with one amplitude modulator and two Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) in cascade. The amplitude modulator is used for the first time in cascade configurations for the generation of OMC signal. All the modulators are driven by RF signal of 30 GHz where specially tailored or fiber-Bragg gratings are not required. The generated OMC is very flat due to the proper DC biasing of MZMs and being related to the optimum ratio of DC bias and half wave voltage of MZMs. OMC offers 61 comb lines with minimum excursions in its comb lines, having tone-to-noise ratio greater than 40 dB, frequency spacing equal to 30 GHz, and high side mode suppression ratio over 35 dB. In this configuration, no optical phase shifter, amplifier, or attenuator is used. Second, optical line terminal (OLT) costs of conventional wavelength division multiplexed passive optical network (WDM-PON) system are reduced by introducing the proposed OMC source at OLT side of WDM-PON system for large capacity WDM-PON that supports numerous users. At OLT side, each out of 61 carriers is capable of supporting 10 Gb/s differential phase shift keying based data in downlink transmission. In the uplink transmission, half power splitters are deployed at optical network unit (ONU) side, where half power of the downlink signal is utilized for uplink transmission based on intensity-modulated on-offkeying resulting in colorless ONUs. The detailed power budget is discussed for the validity of results. Bit error rate (BER), eye patterns, and power penalties lie in the metrics encountered for the analysis in full duplex PON’s transmission. Minimum power penalties at specific BERs of different channels show the applicability of the proposed model.	amplifier;biasing;bit error rate;conley–zehnder theorem;differential phase;duplex (telecommunications);gigabyte;key (cryptography);mach;modulation;network interface device;next-generation network;optical attenuator;optical line termination;passive optical network;rf modulator;radio frequency;telecommunications link;wavelength-division multiplexing;x.690;zero suppression	Rahat Ullah;Liu Bo;Sibghat Ullah;Mao Yaya;Feng Tian;Muhammad Kamran Khan;Xin Xiangjun	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2789863	optical line termination;computer network;modulation;optical amplifier;computer science;power dividers and directional couplers;wavelength-division multiplexing;amplifier;electronic engineering;passive optical network;communication channel	Mobile	65.33062878385958	57.6602656169012	187683

The feasibility analysis indicates that a passive fully-integrated μRFID tag, with on-chip antenna, can be realized in 65-nm SOI CMOS technology at 60 GHz with an operating range of about 20 cm. The 65-nm SOI CMOS technology represents a good candidate due to its better performance in terms of low-losses, low-power consumption and lower leakage current if compared with standard bulk process. The proposed circuit does not require complex package or bonding, thanks to the on-chip antenna, and it does not need battery. The low-cost technology and low-weight and low-area occupation are important features of this μRFID, especially if produced in large scale for the mass-market. Since the design of integrated antennas in silicon technology is one of the main challenge, especially for this proposal, two 60-GHz antennas have been designed by means of 3D-EM simulator: a CPW double-slot antenna and a CPS dipole one. The simulation results show a gain of 4.44 dBi and 3.23 dBi for the proposed double slot and dipole on-chip antennas, respectively.	cmos;computational electromagnetics;dipole antenna;hfss;low-power broadcasting;on-premises wiring;silicon on insulator;simulation;spectral leakage	Alessandro Fonte;Sergio Saponara;Giancarlo Pinto;Bruno Neri	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technologies and Applications	10.1109/RFID-TA.2011.6068678	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;silicon on insulator;cmos	EDA	62.15583803013725	55.60067506647759	187696

Therefore, this paper presents a new design and realization for reducing the size of the branch-line coupler using eight two-step stubs that operates at 2.45 GHz. In this study, the reduced size branch-line coupler has been implemented on a 4 × 4 Butler Matrix, which generally consists of branch-line coupler, crossover, and phase shifter. The simulation results are obtained by using the advanced design system (ADS) in terms of S-Parameter analysis and the phase difference between the ports. Moreover, this design is realized on a low-cost substrate, e.g., flame resistance board (FR4 Board). The obtained results show that the proposed design has reduced the electrical length of transmission line up to 50% and consequently, the area of the branch-line coupler has been reduced up to 30% from the normal size.	acoustic coupler;advanced design system;characteristic impedance;launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;mobile app;performance;pin grid array;power dividers and directional couplers;radiation pattern;reflection coefficient;requirement;return loss;simulation;transmission line	N.

In addition, to alleviate the linearity bottleneck at the LNA input stage, Class-AB self-bias LNTA is employed to break the conventional trade-off's among NF, linearity and power consumption.

67c38585c0536e82a0ea58c067b7c3795034628b	high power, thermally efficient, x-band 3d t/r module with calibration capability for space radar		Earth observation from space radar is based on the active electronically steerable antenna (AESA) whose performances count on reliable and powerful transmit/receive modules (TRM). To this aim, as a follow-up of the successful demonstration of a low-footprint transmit/receive hybrid module concept based on 3-D packaging and interconnect technologies (3DTRM), the interest for carrying out additional development work took a further step aiming at achieving a three-fold module performance improvement as well as at consolidating the novel proposed 3-D technology for space applications. First, the possibility of performing an AESA highly accurate calibration was implemented by embedding a wide band, high directivity directional coupler in the module circuitry without any total module footprint increase. Second, the heat extraction capability of the metal-ceramic hermetic package was enhanced through a re-design of the monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)-to-sink interface. And finally, the gallium arsenide (GaAs) MMIC high power amplifier (HPA) of the first 3DTRM version was replaced by a gallium nitride (GaN) HPA MMIC, obtaining both a higher transmit output power at 5 dB of compressed gain and an improved power added efficiency (PAE) at module level.	acoustic coupler;audio power amplifier;electronic circuit;federal enterprise architecture;hybrid integrated circuit;monolithic microwave integrated circuit;performance;power dividers and directional couplers;power-added efficiency;titanium nitride	Antonio Fina;Alessandro Di Carlofelice;Francesco de Paulis	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876011	power dividers and directional couplers;distributed computing;directivity;gallium nitride;power-added efficiency;space-based radar;amplifier;monolithic microwave integrated circuit;computer science;x band;electrical engineering	EDA	64.79987171151107	55.696504782194715	188641

53be2ef46f3e9810ca48cef4888fee6d8cec6fc8	broadband oscillator-free thz pulse generation and radiation based on direct digital-to-impulse architecture		Broadband 0.03–1.1 THz signal generation and radiation are demonstrated based on an oscillator-free direct digital-to-impulse architecture with a 1.9-ps full width at half maximum and 130-GHz 3-dB bandwidth (BW) (200-GHz 10-dB BW) centered at 160 GHz. The radiated pulse achieves a peak pulse effective isotropic-radiated power of 19.2 dBm and peak pulse-radiated power of 2.6 mW. An ON/OFF impulse-shaping technique is introduced and implemented to suppress undesired ringing and to increase dc-to-radiated efficiency. The frequency-comb spectrum of the radiated pulse train with 5.2-GHz repetition rate is measured up to 1.1 THz. At a distance of 4 cm, the measured received SNR at 1 and 1.1 THz is 28 and 22 dB, respectively. A 1.1-THz tone is measured with a 10-dB spectral width of 2 Hz, demonstrating an extremely narrow spectral line width (two parts per trillion). Time-domain picosecond pulses are characterized using a custom femtosecond-laser-based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system. Coherent spatial combining from two widely spaced chips is demonstrated. It is shown that the starting time of the radiated pulses is locked to the edge of the input digital trigger with a timing jitter of 270 fs. The chip is fabricated in a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS process technology.	analog-to-digital converter;bandwidth (signal processing);bicmos;coherent;dbm;decibel;dirac delta function;frequency drift;noise shaping;pure function;ringing (signal);sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;silicon-germanium;waveform	M.

In the presented structure, by cutting two pairs of U-shaped slots in the ground plane, additional (third and fourth) resonances at 11 and 14 GHz are excited and much wider impedance bandwidth can be produced which provides a wide usable fractional bandwidth of more than 135 % (3–15.7 GHz). In order to generate a single band-notched characteristic, a pair of I-shaped conductor-backed plane was embedded in the antenna backside. Finally, by adding a pair of rotated T-shaped strips in the center of I-shaped structure, a good dual band-notched function is achieved. The measured results reveal that the presented monopole antenna offers a very wide bandwidth around of 5–6 and 7.25–7.75 GHz to suppress any interference from wireless local area network and downlink of X-band satellite communication systems respectively. The designed antenna has a small size of 12 × 18 mm2. Good return loss, antenna gain and radiation pattern characteristics are obtained in the frequency band of interest. Simulated and measured results are presented to validate the usefulness of the proposed antenna structure for UWB applications.	bandwidth (signal processing);characteristic impedance;communications satellite;embedded system;frequency band;interference (communication);mac os x 10.3 panther;radiation pattern;rejection sampling;resonance;return loss;strips;telecommunications link;ultra-wideband	Yasser Ojaroudi;Sajjad Ojaroudi;Nasser Ojaroudi	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-2130-3	folded inverted conformal antenna;antenna aperture;omnidirectional antenna;wi-fi;antenna factor;monopole antenna;antenna rotator;random wire antenna;microstrip antenna;periscope antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;antenna tuner;computer science;operating system;helical antenna;antenna noise temperature;patch antenna;antenna;ultra-wideband;j-pole antenna;radiation pattern;coaxial antenna;dipole antenna;antenna efficiency	Networks	66.07712177853314	57.974880071297264	189237

The proposed phase shifter architecture is scalable in resolution without increasing power consumption. The whole circuit provides 6.6 dB conversion gain, with a total power consumption of 14.7 mW. It achieves in total 225 constellation points for phase and amplitude tuning. It is suitable for accurate beamforming in phased arrays.	baseband;beamforming;cmos;decibel;phased array;scalability	Lu Chuang;Marion Matters-Kammerer;Reza Mahmoudi;Arthur H. M. van Roermund;Peter G.

f03f11bfff056a03596cb4a4afa042d4f2bebe6f	a 3-coil simultaneous power and uplink data transmission inductive link for battery-less implantable devices		Traditional 2-coil inductive link, for battery-less medical implantable devices, could hardly be used for the simultaneous wireless power and data transmission when the coupling is ultra-weak, since the strong power carrier could overwhelm the uplink signal and saturate the receiver. We thus proposed a 3-coil inductive link to transmit power and downlink data, as well as uplink data from the in-body device to the out-body part simultaneously. That is to add one extra out-body coil for the uplink receiving to minimize the power interference to the uplink signal by balanced canceling interference magnetic field. The inbody coil is still shared by the wireless power transfer (WPT) and the uplink communication. Two carriers (i.e. 2 MHz power carrier and 500 kHz uplink data carrier) are used for the WPT and the communication separately. Through optimizing the relative position of the two out-body coils and the circuit parameters, we achieved satisfied signal quality and sufficient efficiency of WPT. The prototype of this link sent −10 dBm power carrying 10 kbps uplink data rate under 10 mW power carrier interference with much relaxed −23 dB signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). This SIR was 67 dB higher than that of the 2-coil solution in our previous work. At the same time, the uplink caused less than 14% relative drop of the WPT efficiency compared with the pure WPT link without the uplink circuits.	dbm;decibel;inductive reasoning;interference (communication);pressure-tolerant electronics;prototype;telecommunications link;tesla coil;uncompressed video	Min Li;Dake Liu;Chen Gong;Wan Qiao	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050362	electronic engineering;electromagnetic coil;transmitter power output;electronic circuit;data transmission;computer science;dbm;telecommunications link;wireless;wireless power transfer	Arch	62.612854251424125	59.543461354254035	191565

The study concentrates on simple printed radiating elements: inverted L-antennas (ILAs) and inverted F-antennas (IFAs). Especially by varying their geometric dimensions, the influence of their shapes is investigated in order to control their input impedance. It is demonstrated that various input impedances can easily be obtained. Thus, these antennas can match with different existing chips, mostly capacitive, by choosing carefully the shape of the antenna.	capacitive sensing;characteristic impedance;input impedance;inverted-f antenna;printing;radio-frequency identification;ultra high frequency	Plamen Iliev;Philippe Le Thuc;Cyril Luxey;Robert Staraj	2007	2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511053	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering	Robotics	65.9688284784428	59.10404911493098	191973

The difference in the response is primarily due to process variation during device fabrication. In this paper, the individual variation of device intermodulation response is studied. Experiments are performed to demonstrate that devices with the same design and layout can be differentiated based on their broadband intermodulation responses. This makes it possible to use RF technology to remotely identify and authenticate electronic devices.	authentication;experiment;intermodulation;nonlinear system;radio frequency	Ashish Mishra;Chen Song;Wenyao Xu;Changzhi Li	2018	2018 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)	10.1109/RWS.2018.8305010	intermodulation;process variation;radio frequency;electronics;nonlinear system;broadband;electronic engineering;computer science	Mobile	62.05144166141263	55.70934860279644	193085

This approach is inspired by the sound localization acuity of a parasitic fly called Ormia ochracea. Motivated by the requirement from practical implementation that each element of the coupling matrix is realized as a passive analog phase shifter and attenuator in a similar fashion as that of conventional analog beamforming, in the proposed approach we confine the magnitude of each element to being no larger than 1. By taking the advantage of the coupling mechanism, this approach can design compact aperture antenna array yet with much improved direction finding performance. Furthermore, the proposed design is applicable to arbitrary array geometry. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show a performance gain of 30 over the uncoupled array of the same aperture of 10 cm diameter at 40 MHz.	arbitrary-precision arithmetic;beamforming;direction finding;numerical method;optical attenuator	Guohua Wang;Joni Polili Lie;Chong Meng Samson See	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947010	aperture;design methods;sound localization;telecommunications;angle of arrival;phase shift module;coupling;antenna array;symmetric matrix	Robotics	63.25002284641854	57.19906206877644	194242

Most of the implantable devices require very small dimensions. On way to achieve it is to use microtechnologies to obtain the required size reduction. One of the most challenging devices to integrate is the antenna, required if we want to communicate with the device trough a wireless link. The proposed antenna uses a MEMS structure to convert the incoming electromagnetic field into a voltage. This antenna allows the reception of signals using a carrier in the kHz range and uses only a chip area of 2x2 mm.	fractal antenna;microelectromechanical systems;radio frequency;system integration;wafer-level packaging	Paulo Mateus Mendes;Luís Alexandre Rocha	2008			electronic engineering;computer science	Mobile	62.37529332664437	55.40239692232203	195683

The rectenna produces DC power from a distant microwave energy transmitter. The generated DC power is then utilized to operate a head-mountable deep brain stimulation device. The rectenna consists of a miniature three-layer planar inverted-F antenna and a Schottky-diode-based bridge rectifier. The antenna has a volume of π × 6 × 1.584 mm3, a resonance frequency of 915 MHz with a simulated bandwidth of 18 MHz (907-925 MHz), and a measured bandwidth of 18 MHz (910-928 MHz) at the return loss of -10 dB. A dielectric substrate of FR-4 of εr = 4.5 and δ = 0.02 is used for simulation and fabrication of the antenna and the rectifier due to its low cost. An L-section impedance matching circuit is employed between the antenna and the rectifier to reduce the mismatch loss. The impedance matching circuit operates as a low-pass filter eliminating higher order harmonics. A deep brain stimulation device is successfully operated by the rectenna at a distance of 20 cm away from a microwave energy transmitter of power 26.77 dBm. The motivation of this paper includes creation of a deep brain stimulation device that operates indefinitely without a battery. From the application standpoint, the developed energy harvesting rectenna facilitates long-term deep brain stimulation of laboratory animals for preclinical research investigating neurological disorders.	dbm;deep brain stimulation;diode bridge;fr-4;impedance matching;inverted-f antenna;low-pass filter;microwave;multitier architecture;rectifier;resonance;return loss;schottky barrier;simulation;transmitter	Md Kamal Hosain;Abbas Z.

The proposed circuit is based on cascode class-E topology with two-stage structure and Chireix power combiner with a floating load. This class-E topology adopts self-biased technique and current-reused technique that avoids using thick-oxide transistors and can enhance the driving ability and power gain. Additionally, the Chireix combiner can reduce the loss of power and improve the efficiency by avoiding the use of isolation resistance. With a 2.5 V power supply, the realized prototype achieved 21.4 dBm of maximum output power and 29.9 % of average power-added efficiency (PAE) at 2.4 GHz. When operated for minimum input levels at 2.5 V, it reached 38.8 dB power gain. For a WLAN OFDM signal with 20 MHz, the error vector magnitude of 3 % is achieved with peak drain efficiency of 62 %. Moreover, the outphasing power amplifier is fully integrated with TSMC 0.18-µm CMOS technology and the chip area including testing pads is 1.07 × 1.17 mm2.	audio power amplifier;cmos;low-power broadcasting;radio frequency	Sichun Du;Xionghui Zhu	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3409-3	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;cmos	Mobile	62.1394497916159	53.45744823070453	197654

The lenses presented here can be designed to provide a prescribed angular response in order to limit the central wavelength shift in thin-film optical filters. They can also be designed for any specific field-of-view (FOV), which allows greater rejection of unwanted background radiation and higher gains. The use of a variety of optical filters to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver is described. Design methods and properties of different Optical Antennas are explained. Comparisons of size and performance of total internal reflection based concentrators with those based on dielectric hemispheres and compound parabolic concentrators (CPCs) are carried out. Finally different experimental results are presented.

0e5c7aabc1a65c8ebb9ae4059c032de73ce8e7f6	novel crosstalk evaluation method for high-density signal traces using clock waveform conversion technique	fext;crosstalk;iir filter;fir filter	Today, as LSI devices are increasingly more integrated resulting in larger number of package pins, high speed signal lines are more easily coupled to each other. Additionally, since multisite testing is required to reduce the cost of test, the transmission lines connecting these pins become even more concentrated. To measure these LSI devices, a huge number of high-speed transmission lines are required in the test board. Therefore minimizing crosstalk is very important. Furthermore, since the number of channels have reached more than ten thousand in recent evaluation systems, it is strongly required that the crosstalk from all channels be measured. With so many channels, measuring crosstalk with traditional methods will at best be very time-consuming or at worse, completely impractical, as it requires either a large number of pulse generators or physical reconnections depending on measurement type. In this paper, we propose a very fast and low cost crosstalk measurement method, which can acquire results very quickly and with high frequency resolution. Only a single measurement makes it possible to evaluate the crosstalk over a wide frequency band without the repetition of manually measuring at each frequency. This method is highly beneficial to the automatic test equipment (ATE) environment with high density transmission lines on the performance boards or load boards.	built-in test equipment;crosstalk;device under test;frequency band;integrated circuit;printed circuit board;step response;tracing (software);transmission line;value network analysis;waveform	Takayuki Nakamura;Koji Asami	2016	2016 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)	10.1109/TEST.2016.7805859	attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio;embedded system;electronic engineering;crosstalk;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;finite impulse response;infinite impulse response	EDA	64.27883880498712	53.87324001359262	199074
199535a5d896c9ff0cc1b027dd3e29d052aed7fb	scpa revolution: linearization of multiphase scpas		In this paper, we introduce the multiphase switched-capacitor power amplifier (MP-SCPA). The MP-SCPA is a digital power amplifier (DPA) that achieves a linear output response using a vector summation of two amplitude weighted constant phase signals. In this way, it avoids using a wideband phase modulator that is required in other DPAs. The MP-SCPA is subject to non-linearity induced by bondwires and other packaging associated inductance that causes variation in the voltage supply available on-chip. To correct for this packaging based non-linearity, we propose a polar digital pre-distortion that is more robust and requires less chip area than traditional lookup table based methods. A prototype MP-SCPA is measured with the polar DPD and found to have similar performance when compared with a dense lookup table based DPD. The MP-SCPA is measured with a 5 MHz, 64 QAM LTE signal and achieves a measured ACLR < −30 dBc, an EVM=3.4%-rms and an average system efficiency of 15.8%.	audio power amplifier;compaq lte;distortion;lookup table;modulation;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;nonlinear system;prototype;requirement;semiconductor chip protection act of 1984;switched capacitor;transmitter	Ali Azam;Zhidong Bai;Wen Yuan;Jeffrey S.

79e87f43bd37cfdddce4ccb0e8881080b2b3a7cf	a novel dual-mode dual band bandpass filter using a quasi fractal structure	fractal filter;dual band;dual mode;bandpass filter	A quasi fractal structure is introduced to build up a nondegenerate dual mode dual band bandpass filter. In the proposed filter a Koch fractal structure is applied to a microstrip patch resonator for miniaturization and dual band operation. The first band is specified by the first iteration of the fractal patch while the second band is determined with the second iteration. The most important feature is that the second band is independent of the first band and is simply tuned which is a challenge in dual band filters. A precise analysis of operation of the filter is presented. The measured results of the filter have good agreement with the full-wave simulated results.	fractal	Fattah Talaei;Mohammad-Naghi Azarmanesh;Gholam Reza Askari;Hamid MirMohammad-Sadeghi	2010	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.7.153	electronic engineering;multi-band device;voltage-controlled filter;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;band-stop filter;m-derived filter	Robotics	65.70108600509856	55.76687920973345	199321
