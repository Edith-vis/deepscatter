197b18e042255a54997dd0b30053928c9e181b1f	a simulator design for small sized auvs		A simulator was designed to be used for small AUVs that are vulnerable to external disturbances like waves or current. Using cubic Hermite interpolation and Line-Of-Sight (LOS) guidance law, an efficient path is generated whenever waypoints are randomly given. Also, the simulator includes proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to maneuver the Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with desired velocities and attitudes. Accordingly, simulation result show that the AUV followed given path in a radius of acceptance.	cubic function;hermite interpolation;pid;randomness;simulation	Jaehoon Jung;Daegil Park;Jinhyun Kim;Wan Kyun Chung	2017	2017 14th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2017.7992841	interpolation;pid controller;control theory;simulation;control engineering;control theory;control system;engineering;hermite interpolation	Robotics	63.83786628871617	-15.906952652438026	160255

I . INTRODUCTION Today the ratio of payload to weight of industrial robot amounts from 1 : l O to 1:30 and less. Compared with man it is very lowone person is able to have a r,atio of 1:3 or more [l]. One of the goals for the next generation of robots will be a ration in this dimension. This might be possible only by developing lightweight robots. When a lightweight robot arm carries heavy end-effector, elastic deformation and transverse vibration may occur. Nevertheless, the end-effwtor of the robot h a s to reach each point in the working space without overshooting. This requires new advanced control algorithm: which can be developed only on the basis of appropriate models for the dynamic behavior. During recent decades, many control algorithms were developed to control flexible arm. But almost approaches are based on PD or PID control even without the analysis of stability. The reason is that the dynamics of flexible arm is too complicated to analyze the stability. Cannon and Schmitz [2] controlled a flexible arm by using an optical sensor to detect end-effector position and optimal control theory biBed on the quadratic performance index approach. Yoshiyuki et al.131 designed a finite-dimensional dyna.mic compensator using sensor outputs to construct a feedback controller on the basis of control theory of distributed-parameter system. But iibove problems of controlling flexible robots has been faced by using linear feedback techniques. Recently t,here has been a few nonlinear control laws [4] [5] by using the techniques similar to the computed torque method which has been used for the rigid arm. On the other hand, there has been many papers concerning adaptive control for rigid arm (6,11,7,8,9] (10,131 In this paper, at first we derive dynamic equation for one link flexible arm by using finite-element and Lagrangian approach. See [5] for further details. Then we propose new generalized deterministic and adaptive control laws for flexible robot arm by using a Lyapunov-like function which is similar to that one which was suggested by Spong e l a1.[12] who used this control scheme for the control of rigid robot manipulator. In proposed contr0.l schemes, we use the fact the matrix d D ( 6 ) l d t ZC(0, e , 6,6) is skew symmetric to simplify the structure of the proposed controllers and the stability of over all system is discussed. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the dynamic equations of a one-link flexible arm modeled by using the assumed mode technique. In section 3, deterministic control law for joint angular displacement is designed. In section 4, adaptive control law for joint angular displacement is design and its stability is discussed. Conclusion are drawn in the final section. 1ARM In this section, we shall derive dynamic model for one-link flexible arm by using the assumed mode technique. The one-link flexible arm is shown in Fig.1. It has a total length equal to L, a hub at one end of inertia J h , mass per unit length p , Young's modulus E, the link cross sectional area A , and constant moment of inertia I . Assuming Bernoulli-Euler beam theory, and small elastic displacements, the link is modeled as where E = z / L is the normalized position along the link. Assuming separability in time and space, i.e. modal analysis gives the following general solution P ~ E I 6 ( t ) = e z p ( j w t ) , w z = __ pAL4 (3) 6(€) = ClsinPE + Czcosp( f Cssinhpt + CrcoshPE (4) The boundary conditions to the problem specify an infinite set of admissible values for the parameter p, each of which determines an associated eigenfrequency w of the beam.

Such systems are found e.g. in satellites and satellite launchers. On-off thrusters are frequently used as actuators for attitude control and are typically subject to switching constraints. In these systems, persistent motions of different nature may occur, such as limit cycles, quasi-periodic-like and chaotic motions. Thus, in the presence of model uncertainties, the emergence of bifurcations can seriously affect performance. In this contribution, we use Tsypkin¿s method in order to investigate the robustness of the condition for the existence of limit cycles. Robustness frontiers in the space of control parameters are identified. These frontiers are verified via simulation and compared to those given by the describing function method, revealing the difficulties of this latter method to address the robustness analysis in this system. Moreover, we present a design method for robust controllers based on the Hamel locus. An evaluation of performance requirements such as fuel consumption, limit cycle amplitude and transient response is carried out in the identified regions of robust behavior.	angular defect;chaos theory;control system;control theory;emergence;locus;limit cycle;quasiperiodicity;relay;requirement;simulation	Alexandre R.

It is shown that, similar to the first-order case as recently discussed in the literature, these mismatches introduce two undesired group behaviors: A distorted final shape and a steady-state motion of the group formation. We show that such undesired behaviors can be eliminated by combining the standard formation control law with distributed estimators. Finally, we show how the mismatches can be effectively employed as design parameters in order to control a combined translational and rotational motion of the formation.	consensus dynamics;first-order predicate;gradient;optimal control;steady state	Hector Garcia de Marina;Bayu Jayawardhana;Ming Cao	2018	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2017.2715226	estimator;steady state;control theory;mathematics;distortion;motion control;control engineering;rotation around a fixed axis	Robotics	64.90558805824597	-16.23352611433395	161337

A network-based model for the unmanned marine vehicle in the network environments is established for the first time by taking sampler-to-control station packet dropouts, network-induced delays, and packet disordering into account. This model is then extended to the unmanned marine vehicle system in the network environments subject to control station-to-actuator, and both sampler-to-control station and control station-to-actuator packet dropouts, network-induced delays, and packet disordering. Based on these models, dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to attenuate the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error and the yaw angle. It is shown through a benchmark example that (i) compared with the unmanned marine vehicle without control, the designed dynamic output feedback controllers can attenuate the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error and the yaw angle; and (ii) the designed dynamic output feedback controllers can provide much smaller oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error and the yaw angle than a proportional–integral controller.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback;unmanned aerial vehicle	Yulong Wang;Qing-Long Han	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2018.01.026	euler angles;control theory;amplitude;yaw;control theory;mathematics;network packet;oscillation	Robotics	66.48464291633218	-12.208957766683547	161708

The robustness feature of the classical SMC treats the modeling uncertainties and disturbances (which are considered as “perturbations”) of the system dynamics. What limits the application and performance features of SMC is the a priori knowledge requirement on the upperbounds of these perturbations. Knowing these bounds the robust control decisions are evaluated utilizing the “worst” occurence possibilities of the perturbations. These controls are over-conservative and they result in poor trajectory tracking performance. The technique presented here, Sliding Mode Control with Perturbation Estimation (SMCPE), deals with both of the above hurdles: It does not require the a priori knowledge of the upperbounds of the uncertainties and it offers much better tracking accuracies. However, SMCPE quires that the control loop speeds be reasonably faster than the perturbation dynamics. The success of SMCPE applications is also closely related to the precision of the state measurements. Experimental justifications are presented from the applications of SMCPE on a SCARA type Hitachi robot.	control system;control theory;nonlinear system;perturbation theory;robust control;scara;system dynamics	Hakan Elmali;Nejat Olgaç	1992		10.1109/ROBOT.1992.219969	robust control;robot;control engineering;mathematical optimization;dynamics;a priori and a posteriori;uncertainty;sliding mode control;computer science;control system;trajectory;control theory;mathematics;tracking;upper and lower bounds;robustness	Robotics	66.43658356442499	-11.086791078350489	162506

We update only the output weights of the network to reduce calculation load so that the control algorithm works online. The advantage of the online learning control is that it does not need a complex modeling process. Also, it continues learning which improves robustness. The algorithm learns the inverse model of the unknown plant with trial and error. And it creates control inputs to follow the desired path. The overall objective is to track the path without any modeling process.

First, a dynamic model of this underactuated system is derived with respect to the wheel motor torques as inputs while taking the nonholonomic no-slip constraints into considerations. This model is compared with the previous models derived for similar systems. The strong accessibility condition is checked and the maximum relative degree of the system is found. Based on this result, a partial feedback linearization of the system is obtained and the internal dynamics equations are isolated. The resulting equations are then used to design two novel controllers. The first one is a two-level velocity controller for tracking vehicle orientation and heading speed set-points, while controlling the vehicle pitch (pendulum angle from the vertical) within a specified range. The second controller is also a two-level controller which stabilizes the vehicle's position to the desired point, while again keeping the pitch bounded between specified limits. Simulation results are provided to show the efficacy of the controllers using realistic data.	accessibility;computer simulation;course (navigation);inverted pendulum;linearizability;mathematical model;motion planning;pitch (music);regular expression;simulation;time-scale calculus;velocity (software development);xojo	Kaustubh Pathak;Jaume Franch;Sunil Kumar Agrawal	2005	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2004.840905	control engineering;mobile robot;inverted pendulum;simulation;nonlinear system;computer science;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.60007543920216	-16.486565310146254	162942
a3b14dc976a8ddd95482e81800f7315a8a73ded8	a motivational driver steering model: task difficulty homeostasis from control theory perspective		Abstract A general and psychologically plausible collision avoidance driver model can improve transportation safety significantly. Most computational driver models found in the literature have used control theory methods only, and they are not established based on psychological theories. In this paper, a unified approach is presented based on concepts taken from psychology and control theory. The “task difficulty homeostasis theory”, a prominent motivational theory, is combined with the “Lyapunov stability method” in control theory to present a general and psychologically plausible model. This approach is used to model driver steering behavior for collision avoidance. The performance of this model is measured by simulation of two collision avoidance scenarios at a wide range of speeds from 20 km/h to 170 km/h. The model is validated by experiments on a driving simulator. The results demonstrate that the model follows human behavior accurately with a mean error of 7%.	control theory;homeostasis	Hamed Mozaffari;Ali Nahvi	2018	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.03.007	collision;lyapunov stability;psychology;driving simulator;control theory;mean squared error	Robotics	62.56622520774867	-14.606672542205189	163033

The control law to track the pitch rate command is developed based on system theory. The controller architecture uses two fuzzy neural networks, which is capable of implementing fuzzy inference in general and neural network mechanism in particular. Neural network 1 with linear filters and back propagation through time learning algorithm is used to approximate the control law as system control part. The bounded signal requirement to develop the neural controller is circumvented using an off-line finite time training scheme in neural network 2 as system learning part, which provides the necessary stability and tracking performances. On-line learning scheme is implemented to compensate for uncertainties due to variation in aerodynamic coefficients, control surface failures and also variations in center of gravity position. The performance of the proposed control scheme is validated at different flight conditions. The disturbance rejection capability of the neural controller is analyzed in the presence of the realistic gust and sensor noises.	artificial neural network	Kaijun Xu;Guangming Zhang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23887-1_21	civil aviation;simulation;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;neuro-fuzzy;control theory;intelligent control	Robotics	62.98436204945017	-10.547166980887539	164331

The inner loop attitude tracking control design is carried out using output feedback based second order sliding mode technique, to ensure finite time convergence of the tracking error dynamics. While addressing tracking control of a time varying reference signal, it is important to investigate the stability characteristics of the internal dynamics to ensure perfect tracking. This paper mainly addresses the output tracking control problem for a MAV and investigate the stability characteristics of the longitudinal zero dynamics during tracking. We have proposed a stability proof based on Lyapunov theory to analyze the stability of the MAV longitudinal zero dynamics during tracking. A nonlinear aircraft model obtained using aerodynamic derivatives of The Blackkite 300 mm wingspan fixed MAV is used for both control design and as well as to verify its performance against the classical control methods.

In many cases, however, the control problem is formulated under platoon configuration and for some predictable noncollision situations. For predictable collision situations, regional and hierarchical approaches have been employed, but these approaches render difficulties due to ignorance for modeling error and logical error in a decision process. In this paper, the vehicle control for collision avoidance is studied with two control objectives, i.e., minimization of the safety distance error and regulation of the relative velocity between two vehicles. For this, a longitudinal controller using terminal sliding mode (TSM) with hierarchical structure is proposed for rear-end collision avoidance. The TSM is employed to achieve convergence in finite time, while the hierarchical approach is used for the system to accommodate the intelligence of the driver to handle various situations.

The dynamic model depends on the geometric configuration of the robot and helps in constructing robot trajectory. Two control design schemes are presented. In the first scheme and based on an appropriate linearized model, the control design focuses on state-feedback strategy the gains of which are determined by linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. In the second scheme and using the original nonlinear model, a nonlinear stabilizing controller is generated by applying backstepping control approach.

Previous attempts at controlling continuum robots have proved difficult due to the complexity of their system dynamics. Taking advantage of a previously developed dynamic model for a three-section, planar, continuum manipulator, we develop an adaptation-based control law. We present simulation results of a set-point tracking between a rigid-link control device and an extensible continuum manipulator. Experimental results of the controller implemented on a six degree-of-freedom continuum robot are also presented.	apache continuum;control theory;mathematical model;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot;simulation;synchronous data link control;system dynamics;triune continuum paradigm	Chase G.

It usually causes the steady-state error of servo systems and results in the creeping phenomenon in low velocity motions. Friction is complicated nonlinear process with time-varying uncertainties. The traditional PID controller of servo systems with fricition was not satisfactory in control precision and response time. In this paper, the fuzzy neural PID controller based on fuzzy neural network(FNN), which combines the advantages of robustness and nonlinear characteristic of fuzzy control and adaptive self-learning capability of neural network, was used to eliminate nonlinear disturbance caused by friction. To solve the problems of stagnation, poor convergence and local optima in traditional NN Learning Algorithms, the modified PSO algorithm is adopted to train FNN on line. The experiment result demonstrates that FNN PID controller can remove friction disturbance efficiently and reduce steady-state error to only one fifth of the one using the PID algorithm.	algorithm;artificial neural network;fuzzy control system;local optimum;nonlinear system;pid;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;response time (technology);servo;steady state;velocity (software development)	Xinghua Li;Wenlei Chen;Yajuan Zhang	2011	2011 Fourth International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design	10.1109/ISCID.2011.175	algorithm design;nonlinear system;computer science;artificial intelligence;friction;control theory;servomotor;fuzzy control system	Robotics	63.595769832011634	-9.939916808569727	164803

The classification property of fuzzy-logic systems makes them a natural candidate for the rejection of errors induced by the deadzone, which has regions in which it behaves differently. A tuning algorithm is given for the fuzzy-logic parameters, so that the deadzone-compensation scheme becomes adaptive, guaranteeing small tracking errors and bounded-parameter estimates. Formal nonlinear-stability proofs are given to show that the tracking error is small. The fuzzy-logic deadzone compensator is implemented on an XY-positioning table to show its efficacy.	algorithm;bibo stability;babinet–soleil compensator;classical xy model;formal system;fuzzy logic;motion compensation;nonlinear system;piezoelectricity;rejection sampling	Jun Oh Jang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2005.858702	fuzzy logic;control engineering;electronic engineering;stability;nonlinear system;computer science;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;fuzzy control system;statistics	Embedded	66.29355196802543	-9.980726750856315	165022

Each joint controller consists of three nonlinear integral terms in the tracking error. Global asymptotic stability of tracking errors is established using the Lyapunov stability theory. The control system is shown to be robust to torque disturbances affecting the system and to a class of unmodeled dynamics. To further improve the robustness of the closed-loop system in situations where measurement noise is present, a simple modification to the controller is proposed. It is shown that exponential convergence of the error to arbitrarily small values is guaranteed with this modification. A systematic procedure for the selection of controller parameters is provided, and simulations results using the complete dynamic model of a six degree of freedom industrial robot are presented to demonstrate the excellent tracking performance of the proposed controller.	control system;industrial robot;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;nonlinear system;simulation;time complexity	Mahmoud Tarokh	1999	IEEE Trans.

However, previous works on fuel-efficient platoon control largely ignore the effect of gear changes, even though experimental studies have shown that gear shifts have a large impact on the behavior and fuel consumption of vehicle platoons. In particular, the interruption in traction force during a gear shift can cause large deviations in the tracking of the reference speed and inter-vehicle distance and can result in the braking of the vehicles. In this paper, we discuss a control architecture that includes the management of gear shifts and we propose a method to select the gears that takes fuel-efficiency into account, but also targets the good behavior of the platoon. In detail, the proposed method is based on a dynamic programming formulation that computes the optimal sequence of gear shifts necessary for the fuel-efficient and smooth tracking of a given reference speed profile. The performance of the proposed approach is finally analyzed by means of simulations by comparing it with the performance of alternative solutions.	dynamic programming;interrupt;platoon (automobile);simulation;topography;traction teampage	Valerio Turri;Bart Besselink;Karl Henrik Johansson	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798508	simulation;gear;engineering;automotive engineering;forensic engineering;force	Robotics	61.917813568607116	-16.182414060324195	165275

The work involved is to analyze and design a control algorithm to achieve synchronized motion between two actuators. The FCC correlates the operational parameters to the position requested by the pilot and monitors the system during normal operation and under failure conditions. The desired motion is achieved through a closed loop feedback control system that senses the actual position of the actuators and corrects them until the desired position is reached. The control algorithm is tested against various test cases. Tests on Hydraulic air break actuators, driven by solenoid operated electro-selector valves and controlled by FCC, proved highly accurate in position regulation as compared to a conventional open loop control system.	feedback	Tanuja Sheorey	2009		10.3182/20090921-3-TR-3005.00101	simulation;computer science;control theory;hardware-in-the-loop simulation	Robotics	67.05451472958772	-13.130052765317831	165966

The NN controller is composed of an outer PD tracking loop, a singular perturbation inner loop for stabilization of the fast flexible-mode dynamics, and an NN inner loop used to feedback linearize the slow pointing dynamics. No off-line training or learning is needed for the NN. It is shown that the tracking performance of the NN controller is far better than that of the PD or PID standard controllers. An extra friction term was added in the tests to demonstrate the ability of the NN to learn unmodeled nonlinear dynamics.	artificial neural network;inner loop;nonlinear system;online and offline;pid;process identifier	Luis B.

39bf8f15172b5e9e8b6b1d12b627699ec22388b8	robust adaptive path-following control of underactuated marine vessel with off-track error constraint		ABSTRACTIn this paper, a new robust adaptive controller is investigated to force an underactuated surface marine vessel to follow a predefined parameterised path at a desired speed, despite actuator saturation and the presence of model uncertainties as well as environmental disturbances induced by waves, wind and sea-currents. To ensure robustness of the path-following controller, time-varying constraint on the off-track error (i.e. the maximal distance from the ship to the reference path) is considered. To address the off-track error constraint the tan-barrier Lyapunov function is incorporated with the control scheme, where the idea of auxiliary design system introduced in Chen, Sam, and Ren (2011) is adopted and its states are used in combination with backstepping and Lyapunov synthesis to adaptive tracking control design with guaranteed stability. Furthermore, the command filters are adopted to implement physical constraints on the virtual control laws so that analytic differentiation of the virtual co...	robustness (computer science);underactuation	Jawhar Ghommam;Sami El-Ferik;Maarouf Saad	2018	Int.

164967e983ae1afa642b49fea7de15cc4fff2ed0	nonlinear backstepping tracking control for a vehicular electronic throttle with input saturation and external disturbance		To achieve more precise positioning of the electronic throttle plate, a nonlinear backstepping tracking control strategy is presented in this paper. In contrast to the existing control schemes for electronic throttles, the input saturation and unknown external disturbances are explicitly considered in the tracking control design. The difficulties in controlling an electronic throttle include the strong nonlinearity of the spring and friction as well as the unknown external disturbance. In particular, the valve plate angle is adjusted by the control input voltage of the driving motor, and the input voltage is limited to a certain range. Therefore, input saturation problems exist in the control system for an electronic throttle. To overcome the abovementioned difficulties, an auxiliary design system is presented to handle the input saturation, and its state is applied in the proposed control design. A sliding-mode control term is also utilized in the tracking controller to counteract the unknown external disturbance. The proof and analysis show that the satisfactory tracking performance of the valve plate angle can be achieved by using the designed control scheme for the electronic throttle system in the presence of input saturation and unknown external disturbances. Simulation studies and results are provided to illustrate the desired performance of the proposed nonlinear tracking controller.	control engineering;control system;control theory;nonlinear system;precise point positioning;simulation	Bai Rui;Yu Kyung Yang;Wang Yan Wei	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783948	voltage;control theory;backstepping;computer science;torque;saturation (chemistry);throttle;nonlinear system;distributed computing;control theory;control system	Robotics	67.40349142132492	-10.83986493674216	169242
b0ce6aea7d398a018c343265b69f98ed2a73b6d6	chattering free sliding mode controller design for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle		In this paper, a nonlinear model for a Quadrotor Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) type of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is firstly established for the attitude and position control. All aerodynamic forces and moments of the studied Quadrotor UAV are described within an inertial frame. Such a dynamical model is obtained using the Newton-Euler formalism. Secondly, an improved nonlinear Sliding Mode Control (SMC) approach is designed for this aircraft in order to stabilize its vertical flight dynamics, while avoiding the classical chattering problem. Since chattering phenomena is the most problematic issue in the sliding mode control applications, a Quasi Sliding Mode Control (QSMC) technique is used as a solution for the chattering avoidance in Quadrotor dynamics control. Demonstrative simulations are carried out in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed QSMC approach for the stabilization and tracking of various desired trajectories.	aerial photography;unmanned aerial vehicle	Nour Ben Ammar;Soufiene Bouallègue;Joseph Haggège;Sundarapandian Vaidyanathan	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-55598-0_3	control engineering;aeronautics;control theory	Robotics	65.0803841431995	-13.776224556132556	169568

This should be contrasted with the commonly used switched or time-varying laws. We propose a control design that provides asymptotic stability of an manifold (also called relative equilibria)-due to the Brockett condition this is the only type of stabilisation possible using smooth time-invariant control laws. The equilibrium manifold can be shaped to certain extent to satisfy specific control objectives. The proposed control law also incorporates integral action, and thus the closed-loop system is robust to unknown constant disturbances. A key step in the proposed design is a change of coordinates not only in the momentum, but also in the position vector, which differs from coordinate transformations previously proposed in the literature for the control of nonholonomic systems. The theoretical properties of the control law are verified via numerical simulation based on a robotic ground vehicle model with differential traction wheels and non co-axial centre of mass and point of contact.	computer simulation;control engineering;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;optimal control;periodic boundary conditions;robot;time-invariant system;traction teampage;wheels	Alejandro Donaire;José Guadalupe Romero;Tristan Perez;Romeo Ortega	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139805	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;manifold;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;mechanical system;robot kinematics	Robotics	65.10887036167087	-16.858738227643077	169626

At the same time of avoiding rollover accidents, prohibiting the vehicle from the driver's intended and the vehicle's actual lane, and the effect of crosswind is also important, since it may yield other accidents. Thus, it is necessary to track the driver's desired path as closely as possible while preventing the vehicle from rollover, and maintaining the vehicle stability along the desired path. Here, we start from the results presented in [1], then we extend and propose switching model predictive control which uses direct yaw moment control and active rear steer. Simultaneously, the trade-off between rollover prevention and path tracking is highlighted, and an effectiveness of using switching controllers designed for the trade-off solution is also confirmed through simulation results.	approximation;lateral thinking;obstacle avoidance;rollover (key);simulation;wheels;yaws	Fitri Yakub;Yasuchika Mori	2015	2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244468	control engineering;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	62.762106801900934	-16.064891119245065	169667

The proposed framework has superior features such as high performance in modeling and controlling, an easy implementation, a stable convergence characteristic, and a significantly improved computational efficiency. To validate and show the advantages of the presented technique, it is applied to the trajectory tracking of a triple pendulum, and the results are compared to the ones given by the linear-quadratic regulator computed-torque control law.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;computational complexity theory;dynamical system;inverse dynamics;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation	Arman Dabiri;Mohammad Poursina;Eric A.

Because of high dynamical coupling between the actively operated manipulator and the free-floating base, two inherent difficulties exist, such as non-linear parameterization of the dynamic equation and both kinematic and dynamic parameter uncertainties. In order to compensate these uncertainties, we use the fuzzy logic system (FLS) that has the capability to approximate any nonlinear function. The proposed adaptive controller does not involve complex calculations, but it is still possible for the system to generate a suitable input torque and a compensator to overcome the uncertainties. Then, the stability is proved and the structure of the control method is given. To verify the validity of the proposed method, a computer simulation of a two-link planar FFSR is carried out.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;free library of springfield township;fuzzy logic;mathematical model;nonlinear system;robot	Shuang Liu;Caiwen Ma;Cuihua Luo;Xiaobai Wang	2010	2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569382	computer simulation;fuzzy logic;robust control;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;function approximation;computer science;artificial intelligence;manipulator;machine learning;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system;robustness	Robotics	64.59633652444239	-11.203023801708083	171417

Typically, in a discrete-time repetitive process, ILC schemes use error from the entire previous cycle for updating the control input in the current cycle. Partial information of error from the previous cycle can be modeled as a projection onto a lower dimensional subspace. By appropriate choice of the subspace, noise and other non- repetitive disturbances in the error can be suppressed, leading to cleaner learning signals. In particular, two aspects of the orthogonal projection-based ILC schemes are investigated. First, conditions on stability of the projection-based ILC scheme are developed. Second, given a stable ILC scheme which uses the full error vector, the possible choices of projection subspaces is discussed. Implementation of the projection-based ILC scheme in precision positioning of a waferstage is presented. The major sources of repetitive error in precision tracking are phase- mismatch and force ripple. These effects are mathematically modeled and the subspace spanned by them is obtained from initial experimentation. A standard P-type ILC scheme based on the proposed projection method is then used in control of a prototype one DOF waferstage to effectively reject the error caused by these disturbances, thereby verifying the effectiveness of the proposed projection ILC scheme.	iterative method;prototype;ripple effect;system camera;use error;verification and validation	Sandipan Mishra;Masayoshi Tomizuka	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4434740	control engineering;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;projection method;orthographic projection;statistics;iterative learning control	Vision	65.70555841470834	-11.943083757049298	171662

The base XY stage is a two dimensional linear stepper (Sawyer) motor including a rotational (yaw) degree-of-freedom. Manufacturing systems based on Sawyer motors are widely used in wafer probing applications and in automated assembly. A Sawyer sensor is being integrated for measuring the motor's position, velocity and yaw rotation for closed-loop control purposes on our testbed at the CRRL. Utilizing results on robust control of nonlinear systems, an adaptive current-level controller is designed for the motor that renders the closed-loop system robust to a variety of uncertainties and disturbances. A detailed model of the motor that takes into account the significant uncertainties of the motor is used in the control design. The tracking error is shown to asymptotically converge to the origin.

d3f9d1ed12390e2c5ee7d11383726d94e1588cc2	gone with the wind: nonlinear guidance for small fixed-wing aircraft in arbitrarily strong windfields		The recent years have witnessed increased development of small, autonomous fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In order to unlock widespread applicability of these platforms, they need to be capable of operating under a variety of environmental conditions. Due to their small size, low weight, and low speeds, they require the capability of coping with wind speeds that are approaching or even faster than the nominal airspeed. In this paper we present a principled nonlinear guidance strategy, addressing this problem. More broadly, we propose a methodology for the high-level control of non-holonomic unicycle-like vehicles in the presence of strong flowfields (e.g. winds, underwater currents) which may outreach the maximum vehicle speed. The proposed strategy guarantees convergence to a safe and stable vehicle configuration with respect to the flowfield, while preserving some tracking performance with respect to the target path. Evaluations in simulations and a challenging real-world flight experiment in very windy conditions confirm the feasibility of the proposed guidance approach.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;high- and low-level;nominal type system;nonlinear system;sim lock;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Luca Furieri;Thomas Stastny;Lorenzo Marconi;Roland Siegwart;Igor Gilitschenski	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963609	control theory;vehicle dynamics;control engineering;computer science;wind speed;nonlinear system;airspeed;convergence (routing);wing	Robotics	61.35688501259072	-16.234732450359672	172675

The proposed scheme allows for uncertain influences in the system, such as the aerodynamic cross coupling, inertial coupling between each channel in the attitude motion and model parameter uncertainties. In order to decrease the influences, this method uses an ESO to estimate the total influence of various disturbance factors. The simulation result shows that the proposed controller based on ESO can suppress the influence of channel coupling effectively. The control precision is greatly improved compared with the traditional method.	optimal control	Shenming Quan;Tao Chao;Songyan Wang;Ming Yang	2017		10.1109/ASCC.2017.8287226	reentry;attitude control;control theory;physics;inertia coupling;aerodynamics;control theory;state observer;coupling;communication channel	Robotics	66.06770207781567	-12.292162461778563	172884

In our case, an astronomical telescope secondary mirror is supported by a hexapod platform and it is complete with its own control system. It is actually functioning on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (La Palma Island Spain). The complete movement-position loop control involve a nonlinear equation system and the basic control algorithm is written using a numerical solution for this non-linear set. In order to permit a better real-time control of the optics, faster algorithms have been explored. Among those, a neural network approach has been studied.

Based on the filtered-x least mean square algorithm, an active vibration controller is used as a feedforward controller to improve the control performance further. Using an experimental device, which was designed to imitate the real vehicle engine-body system, some experiments have been made to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme.	biological system	Jianming Yang;Yoshikazu Suematsu;Zibo Kang	2001	IEEE Trans.

e9575cf22c3a5c75850495210db3fa95c1d9eb67	stable direct adaptive neural control of an electrically driven dual-axis motion platform using backstepping technique		In this paper, the adaptive backstepping neural control (ABNC) is applied to an electrically driven dual-axis motion platform. The Dynamic model of the electrically driven dual-axis motion is obtained by coupling the dynamics of the dual-axis motion platform with the actuators (DC motors) dynamics. Thus, it is more realistic to select the actuators input voltages to be the control inputs instead of input torques, unlike the case when the actuators dynamics are not included. Unlike the existing ABNC techniques, single hidden layer feedforward neural networks with additive hidden nodes (SLFNN) are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions in the actual and virtual control laws where the networks parameters are adjusted based on extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. In ELM-based SLFNN, the hidden layer parameters are randomly selected and only the output layer weights linking the hidden layer with the output layer are needed to be updated. The adaptive update laws for the output layer weights are derived based on Lyapounov stability theory for guaranteeing semi-global boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. The simulation study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed controller and shows that the system outputs track the desired trajectories with small tracking errors.	motion simulator;optic axis of a crystal	Yasser Elkoteshy;Shuyuan Yang;Licheng Jiao	2013		10.3182/20130902-3-CN-3020.00020	simulation;control theory	Robotics	64.625798331288	-11.573202423683234	174004

A novel region tracking controller is proposed to drive AUV's position tracking error in each instant into the predefined sphere region. It is realized by constructing a continuous and differentiable piecewise function firstly, and then by designing a virtual variable based on Euclidean norm and fractional power of position tracking error. The stability of the closed-loop system and region-reaching of tracking errors are analyzed based on Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's lemma. Finally, the proposed approach is employed to an AUV for tacking two kinds of trajectories.

05f1d042ae2ec4eb7e8304726630cfbff901adcd	modeling and control of a saucer type coandä effect uav		The concept of utilizing the Coandia effect to produce stable flight in saucer type Aerial Vehicles (AV) was first conceived in 1935 by Henri Marie Coanda. Coanda's proposed AV design remained a relatively unexplored curiosity for decades until the recent surge in popularity of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) revitalized interest in the topic. Coandä effect UAV offer some distinct advantages over standard multirotors due to their robust frame design, which offers a unique mix of crash resistance, flight safety, and flight performance making them ideal for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications. While much work has been performed in the area of characterization for Coanda surfaces and improved mechanical design of saucer type UAV, little work has been found in the literature discussing stability and attitude control of the platform. This work seeks to contribute to the study of these drones by introducing an approximate servo mapping for desired control effort of a particular prototype, and an experimental control law implemented within the framework of a modified commercially available flight stack.	advanced power management;aerial photography;approximation algorithm;coefficient;experiment;firmware;human–robot interaction;mathematical model;optimal control;prototype;servo;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jameson Y.

463627bfd56ca4287942da281fc6d52708509147	robust cooperative positioning control of composite nested linear switched reluctance machines with network-induced time delays		This paper addresses the robust cooperative positioning control for the networked composite nested linear switched reluctance machines (LSRMs) with network-induced sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator time delays and uncertain motor parameters. In complex industrial processes, considering the spatio-temporal cooperative nested movement relationship of a master motor and a slave motor nested on the master one, and the inevitable motor parameters identification errors, the robust cooperative positioning control method is proposed based on the networked control method. In order to realize long distance movement and complementary close movement for industrial requirements, the composite nested LSRMs over communication networks are modeled as a Markov time-delay system with the motor parameters uncertainties. The stability conditions and the robust positioning controller design method for the composite nested LSRMs are obtained by using Lyapunov theory and the inequality technique. Several groups of experimental tests are presented to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed robust cooperative positioning control method for the networked composite nested LSRM control systems.	broadcast delay;control system;global positioning system;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;requirement;social inequality;telecommunications network	Li Qiu;Yang Shi;Jianfei Pan;Bo Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2772186	telecommunications network;control engineering;control theory;lyapunov function;control theory;engineering;switched reluctance motor;control system;markov chain;composite number	Robotics	64.75019898108103	-15.392714062548176	177005

In adaptive systems this inverse mapping is learned from examples. The biological motor control is very redundant, as are many robotic systems, therefore the mapping is many-to-one and the inverse problem is ill posed. In this paper we present a novel architecture and algorithms for the approximation and inversion of many-to-one functions. The proposed architecture retains all the possible solutions available to the controller in real time. This is done by a modified mixture of experts architecture, where each expert is linear and more than a single expert may be assigned to the same input region. The learning is implemented by the hinging hyperplanes algorithm. The proposed architecture is described and its operation is illustrated for some simple cases. Finally the virtue of redundancy and its exploitation by multiple controllers are discussed.	adaptive system;algorithm;approximation;approximation algorithm;feed forward (control);linear approximation;one-to-many (data model);piecewise linear continuation;polyhedral;robot;well-posed problem	Amir Karniel;Ron Meir;Gideon F.

The dynamics based on the momentum conservation law for the free-floating space manipulator has non-linear parameterization properties. Therefore, the adaptive control based on a linear parameterization model cannot be used in this dynamics. In this paper, the dynamics of the free-floating space manipulator system are derived using the Dynamically Equivalent Model (DEM) approach. The DEM is a fixed-base manipulator system and allows us to linearly parameterize the dynamic equations. Using this linearly parameterized dynamic equation, an adaptive control method is developed to control the system in joint space.

Mobile robots equipped with undeformable wheels are referred to as 'wheeled mobile robots' and constitute a typical example of non-holonomic systems, where the standard control algorithms developed for robotic manipulators without constraints are no longer applicable. It is shown using the formulation of a dynamic feedback linearization (DFL) methodology that a robust sliding mode controller is an efficient design tool to take into account stabilization and tracking control problems. Compared with previous studies based on DFL, the proposed method shows improvement of the trajectory tracking and stabilization process. The robustness is guaranteed in the presence of parameter uncertainty or unmodeled dynamics by the robust sliding mode control technique. Simulation results along with the conclusions drawn are discussed.	mobile robot	M. Belhocine;Mustapha Hamerlain;F.

The command governor modification is applied for the first time to an underwater vehicle simulation of the actual vehicle for improved transient performance and disturbance rejection. The vehicle dynamics are assumed to be decoupled thus allowing for the design of separate heading and depth controllers. The results show that in contrast to standard adaptive controllers, command governor based adaptive controllers are able to produce better transient performance as well as improve the overall response even at low learning rates. Furthermore, simulation results verify the disturbance rejection capability of the command governor based adaptive controller, which is necessary to effectively and safely operate an unmanned underwater vehicle in real environments.	amc computerized engine control;adaptive grammar;advanced mezzanine card;centrifugal governor;course (navigation);full scale;matlab;nonlinear system;rejection sampling;simulation;simulink;unmanned aerial vehicle	Charita D.

f43528a1ab78b38d4935bdbc5fa75e8edab4e6ec	design on subsection based mix position controller for lower limb rehabilitation robot		The technology of lower limb rehabilitation robot is a hot research topic in recent years, while the exoskeleton robot is a typical representative. Accurate trajectory tracking ability is the base of the exoskeleton mechanical leg to coordinately drive trainers to do rehabilitation training on the treadmill. In this paper, aiming at the existing exoskeleton body, taking into account the uncertain factors such as the modeling errors and the environment, the position controller is designed based on different gait events. During the swing phase, the kinetic model of the robot is basically determined, and the position controller is designed by using the sliding mode control (SMC) method, and the fuzzy compensation method is introduced to reduce disturbances; during the stand phase, as the introduction of treadmill contact force, the kinetic model cannot be determined, then, the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) is used as feedforward control, and the PID control is introduced as feedback to ensure the stability of the control system; finally, the above methods are mixed by the position segmentation. The simulation results show that the proposed method has good trajectory tracking ability and stability in the presence of modeling errors and other disturbances when compared with the traditional computed torque control.	biconnected component;cerebellar model articulation controller;control system;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;one-key mac;pid;robot;simulation	Qiang Zhang;Xiaodong Zhang;Gui Yin;Kuncai Yang;Jun Xie;Xingliang Han	2017	2017 14th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2017.7992809	control theory;sliding mode control;torque;pid controller;feed forward;cerebellar model articulation controller;control engineering;engineering;robot kinematics;control theory;control system	Robotics	68.20454443880523	-15.97802793668424	180845

The attitude estimates are obtained from rate gyros measurements, corrupted by bias, and image coordinates from a set of landmarks on the terrain, obtained by a controllable pan and tilt camera. Lateral-longitudinal stabilization is achieved with a nested saturation control law by feedback of the image measurements, estimated body attitude, and corrected rate gyros measurements. The vehicle is stabilized vertically using an additional vertical position sensor. Due to the input-to-state stability property of controller, the quadrotor position and attitude are shown to converge to the desired equilibrium point and the convergence is robust to the estimation errors. Additionally, the pan and tilt camera is actively actuated to keep the landmarks visible in the image sensor for most operating conditions. The performance of the proposed ensemble is illustrated with some simulation results.	angularjs;control theory;converge;image plane;image sensor;lateral computing;lateral thinking;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation;spectral centroid	David Cabecinhas;Sérgio Bras;Carlos Silvestre;Paulo Jorge Ramalho Oliveira;Rita Cunha	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426201	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;stability;gyroscope;engineering;control theory;feedback;mathematics;attitude control;statistics	Robotics	64.423886891441	-16.298515773140412	181238

This paper investigates the discrete time case. A novel scheme for integrating a neural network (NN) approach with an adaptive implementation of the sliding mode control with the sector is developed. The sliding mode control with the sector serves two purposes, one is to provide the global stability of the closed loop system, the other is to improve the tracking performance. The whole system stability and tracking error convergence are proved by Lyapunov techniques which yield a NN weight tuning algorithm.	artificial neural network;robot	Fuchun Sun;Zengqi Sun;Rongjun Zhang	1996		10.1109/ROBOT.1996.509236	robust control;robot;control engineering;discrete time and continuous time;real-time computing;stability;sliding mode control;computer science;engineering;trajectory;control theory;tracking;artificial neural network	Robotics	63.848094967591315	-10.264151965695818	181475

The proposed scheme is based on the inter-run estimation of unknown disturbances, such as wind induced forces and model uncertainties. These disturbance estimates are introduced in an optimal control problem used to compute feedforward controls. In order to achieve good run-to-run disturbance rejection, the structure of the underlying stabilizing flight control of the RPAS is taken into account. In this work, we consider flight control based on adaptive reference following and the special case of the unmanned helicopter ARTIS. We present simulation results and flight test data. These results underpin that the proposed approach significantly decreases flight path deviations in a run-to-run fashion.	computer simulation;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;kalman filter;mathematical optimization;optimal control;reference model;rejection sampling;simulation;test data;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Johann C.

The designed controller is implemented and tested experimentally on a laboratory scale civil structure. For comparison purposes, the passive seismic mitigation case is also considered, as well as the active case using the traditional optimal controller.

Two different control approaches have been used to improve the trajectory tracking performance of the designed manipulator. The first approach considered a single input-single output (SISO) linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for trajectory tracking control of the manipulator. Another controller type based on a nonlinear sliding mode controller method has been utilized to take decoupled dynamic approximation model of the manipulator into account and to improve tracking performance of the manipulator. Real-time experimental results for the two different control techniques have been verified. Finally, according to the results, the nonlinear sliding mode controller method has improved the tracking performance of the designed manipulator.	approximation;experiment;mathematical model;nonlinear system;parallel manipulator;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;robust control;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder	Ahmet Dumlu;Koksal Erenturk;Aliriza Kaleli;Kagan Koray Ayten	2017	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574716000709	control engineering;manipulator;engineering	Robotics	67.0818758526505	-14.63254131396564	183997

The proposed solution augments the symmetric bidirectional control algorithm with a wave-absorbing controller implemented on the leader, and/or on the rear-end vehicle. The wave-absorbing controller actively absorbs an incoming wave of positional changes in the platoon and thus prevents oscillations of inter-vehicle distances. The proposed controller significantly improves the performance of platoon manoeuvrers such as acceleration/deceleration or changing the distances between vehicles without making the platoon string unstable. Numerical simulations show that the wave-absorbing controller performs efficiently even for platoons with a large number of vehicles, for which other platooning algorithms are inefficient or require wireless communication between vehicles.	algorithm;control theory;distributed control system;numerical linear algebra;simulation	Dan Martinec;Ivo Herman;Zdenek Hurák;Michael Sebek	2014	Eur.

The unknown matched disturbance is fully considered and estimated in this paper, and the estimation error is proven to be finite-time convergent. A sliding mode controller based on the multiple sliding surface technique is proposed in which the disturbance is compensated. The overall system containing both the observer and the controller is proven to be stable. The tracking error is within the neighbourhood of the origin before the observer completes its convergence and converges to zero thereafter.

Firstly, by using the advantages of nonsingular terminal sliding mode in finite time convergence and robustness, the fast nonsingular terminal sliding surface is introduced. Second, a new double power reaching law with two order sliding mode characteristics, which can effectively suppress chattering, is proposed. Third, the super twisting disturbance observer is designed to realize the estimation and compensation of the complex disturbance.

After estimating the biped states of the next moment using a UKF, an SVR learning controller with the predicted biped states is implemented to ensure the zero moment point (ZMP) stability. Using the predicted biped states, the SVR learning controller can predictably adjust the posture of the trunk timely and properly to adapt to the dynamic posture of the whole body. The flexibility of biped robots is enhanced by the proposed method, which is promising for realizing the stable biped walking in unstructured environments.

65ee9a7e46e20a7f6cabef307dd4721543c5a115	attitude stabilization of a nadir-pointing small satellite using only magnetic actuators		Recently, there has been a surge of interest in small satellite missions due to low-cost launch opportunities. In particular, the feasibility of nonlinear techniques for the attitude control of small satellites using only magnetic actuators is becoming a topic of increasing interest in the literature. Since magnetic control systems are relatively lightweight, require low power and are inexpensive, they are attractive for small, inexpensive satellites in low Earth orbits. In this paper we present averaging-based feedback control laws that achieve three-axis stabilized nadirpointing attitude. We propose nonlinear quaternion feedback laws. Two cases are considered; full state feedback that uses both attitude and angular velocity measurement and passivitybased feedback that does not require angular velocity information. Computer simulations are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control laws.	algorithm;angularjs;apache axis;computer simulation;control engineering;control system;feedback;nonlinear system;rejection sampling;robust control;simulation;the matrix;velocity (software development)	Mahmut Reyhanoglu;Chau Ton;Sergey V.

The described project is realized in CompactRIO controller (cRIO-real-time embedded controller with reconfigurable input and output modules) equipped with an FPGA chip. The proposed speed controller is based on Adaptive Linear Neuron (ADALINE) model with on-line updated weights coefficients. The main advantages of the tested controller are simplicity and a reduced number of parameters for selection in the design process. Several stages of the real implementation are described. The two-mass drive system is modeled using the main processor of the cRIO, to emulate the real system, while the structure of the ADALINE model and its adaptation law are implemented in the FPGA module. Thus, hardware in the loop simulation is obtained. The obtained results present correct speed control with high dynamics and show the influence of the adaptation coefficient of the ADALINE-based controller on drive transients.

The robustness of this controller is proved with respect to change of road adherence, load transfer, and lateral movements. The optimal target slip is computed thanks to perturb and observe algorithm which is inspired from the extremum seeking algorithms. The objective of this algorithm is to seek the appropriate longitudinal braking forces and to avoid rear wheel’s loss of contact.

1e744bc1b19e58b9985670ada54a3d7a216bf5f9	real time acceleration tracking of electro-hydraulic shake tables combining inverse compensation technique and neural-based adaptive controller		Electro-hydraulic shake table (EHST) is vital seismic testing equipment in earthquake engineering for the assessment of structures subject to dynamic vibration excitations. The EHST system can be generally simplified as an electro-hydraulic servo system with prominent acceleration replication requirement. In order to improve the acceleration tracking performance of a typical EHST system, a novel real-time acceleration tracking strategy combining inverse compensation technique and neural-based adaptive controller is presented in this paper. The traditional three variable controller (TVC) is applied to the EHST system for obtaining a preliminary acceleration tracking accuracy in advance, and then the multi-innovation stochastic gradient algorithm is utilized to estimate the discrete parametric transfer function of the TVC controlled EHST system. Next, the zero magnitude error tracking technique, which is capable of handling non-minimum phase zeros, is exploited to design a stable and casual inverse model, and subsequently the parametric inverse compensation technique for the EHST system is constructed. Finally, a neural-based online adaptive controller is incorporated to the offline designed parametric inverse compensator as an outer loop, and the side effects of the system’s inherent nonlinearities, varying dynamics, and external uncertainties are further addressed. The proposed controller is successfully implemented in the control system of a unidirectional EHST test rig using xPC target rapid prototyping technique, and experimental results reveal that a superior acceleration replication performance is achieved in contrast to the other comparative controllers.	algorithm;control system;gradient;minimum phase;online and offline;rapid prototyping;real-time business intelligence;real-time clock;servo;tatsunoko vs. capcom:;transfer function	Yu Tang;Zhencai Zhu;Gang Shen;Wenjuan Zhang	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756084	acceleration;iterative method;computer science;transfer function;control theory;servomechanism;parametric statistics;servomotor;control system;control theory	Robotics	67.49163443361488	-10.069170700315787	190326

The objective is to design a stable AAN controller with an adjustable assistance level. The controller aims to follow a desired trajectory while allowing an adjustable tracking error with low control effort to provide a freedom zone for the user. By ensuring the stability of the system and providing the freedom zone, the controller combines the advantages of both model-based and non-model-based AAN controllers existing in the literature. Furthermore, the controller provides a priori bounded control command, and includes an adaptive neural network term to compensate for the uncertainties of dynamic model of the system, mainly when a precise tracking is of interest. The stability of the closed-loop system is well analysed based on the Lyapunov method. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated through experiments using a lower extremity robotic exoskeleton.	artificial neural network;characteristic impedance;controller (computing);experiment;eye tracking;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;robot	Hamed Jabbari;Tatsuo Narikiyo;Michihiro Kawanishi	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7962953	control theory;control engineering;adaptive system;computer science;robot;control theory;artificial neural network;powered exoskeleton;bounded function;tracking error;lyapunov function	Robotics	65.0694391999332	-11.692566609018062	190407

96d6b2f9dba1edf51a77fe32f4c5fe488d67f355	energy-based output feedback tension control for space tether deployment under physical constraint		This paper focuses on the tethered satellite deployment control issue via tether tension control in a propellant-free manner. The tether deployment is a typical underactuated control problem when only the tension control was employed by actively accommodate tether length by mechanical device. Firstly, unlike most existing control methods, the energy-based view of feedback approaches are proposed in an analytical form with tension constraint. To regulate the dynamic behavior of tether deployment, an artificial potential energy function is introduced and combined with the system's Hamiltonian to construct the Lyapunov function. The asymptotic stability is shown by invoking the Lyapunov technique and LaSalle's invariance principle. Secondly, the proposed control approach is extended into an output feedback form without velocity measurement. Because the relative position can be easily measured rather than velocity from the practical perspective. In the controller, the term of tether length velocity is replaced by an approximate differentiation. Finally, numerical simulations are carried on to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches. Performance of these proposed control approaches is investigated according to their dependency on control gains.	approximation algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;computer simulation;feedback;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;software deployment;underactuation;velocity (software development)	Junjie Kang;Zheng H.

We employ two complementary methods. The first is based on the estimation of the external wrench (force and torque) due to aerodynamics acting on the robot in flight. Wind velocity is obtained by inverting an identified model of the aerodynamic forces. The second method is based on the estimation of the propeller aerodynamic power, and provides an estimate independent of other sensors. We show how to calculate components of the wind velocity using multiple aerodynamic power measurements, when the poses between them are known. The method uses the motor current and angular velocity as measured by the electronic speed controllers, essentially using the propellers as wind sensors. Verification of the methods and model identification were done using measurements acquired during autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel.	algorithm;angularjs;autonomous robot;experiment;ground truth;linear model;moser spindle;radial basis function;schmidt decomposition;sensor;system identification;velocity (software development)	Teodor Tomic;Korbinian Schmid;Philipp Lutz;Andrew Mathers;Sami Haddadin	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759264	wind speed;control engineering;estimation;simulation;propeller;aerodynamics;engineering;control theory;statistics	Robotics	65.68501946811656	-16.01097842415242	190926

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require sophisticated hand- tuned models, but rather learns the policy online, which makes the system easily adaptable to changing conditions. The blimp we apply our approach to is a small-scale vehicle equipped with an ultrasound sensor that measures its elevation relative to the ground. The major problem in the context of learning control policies lies in the high-dimensional state-action space that needs to be explored in order to identify the values of all state-action pairs. In this paper, we propose a solution to learning continuous control policies based on the Gaussian process model. In practical experiments carried out on a real robot we demonstrate that the system is able to learn a policy online within a few minutes only.	aerial photography;experiment;gaussian process;monte carlo method;process modeling;reinforcement learning;robot;system dynamics	Axel Rottmann;Christian Plagemann;Peter Hilgers;Wolfram Burgard	1998	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/ROBOT.1998.680973	computer simulation;mobile robot;payload;sea surface temperature;navigation;hydrogen;vehicle dynamics;simulation;aerodynamics;aerospace engineering;computer science;engineering;control system;aeronautics;instruction set;atmosphere;system dynamics;helium	Robotics	61.90627091194885	-16.679750187874	191212

In this paper, an adaptive critic-based neuro-fuzzy system is presented for an unmanned bicycle. The only information available for the critic agent is the system feedback which is interpreted as the last action performed by the controller in the previous state. The signal produced by the critic agent is used along with the error back propagation to tune (online) conclusion parts of the fuzzy inference rules of the adaptive controller. Simulations and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller. The results demonstrate superior performance of the developed controller in terms of improved transient response, robustness to model uncertainty and fast online learning.	backpropagation;computer simulation;dynamic programming;experiment;feedback;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;neuro-fuzzy;online machine learning;reinforcement learning;software propagation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Ali Shafiekhani;Mohammad J.

These rules are written to train and guide safe human operation of marine vehicles and are heavily dependent on human common sense in determining rule applicability as well as rule execution, especially when multiple rules apply simultaneously. To capture the flexibility exploited by humans, this work applies a novel method of multi-objective optimization, interval programming, in a behavior-based control framework for representing the navigation rules, as well as task behaviors, in a way that achieves simultaneous optimal satisfaction. We present experimental validation of this approach using multiple autonomous surface craft.

The specific controller of the simulated robot is a feed-forward network with noisy weights, i.e, the weight values are perturbed by additive, normal noise. The neurocontrollers are evolved in a noise-free environment, and the best-performing networks are then tested in noisy environments, where peg movement and sensor signals are afflicted by noise. We find that the internal (robotic brain) noise is beneficial in coping with external noise, especially, in the case of noisy sensors.	artificial neural network;biological system;experiment;feedforward neural network;image noise;parsing expression grammar;robot;sensor;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Helmut A.

High positioning accuracy and low tracking errors within a specified bandwidth are their performance specifications. Both controllers use the same state feedback controller, but have a different feedforward design approach. Both feedforward methods design stable prefilters which approximate the unstable inverse system model. The first method designs a stable prefilter using the extended bandwidth zero phase error tracking control (EBZPETC) method [11], which is an extension of Tomizuka’s well-known zero phase error tracking control (ZPETC) method [10]. The second feedforward method adds delay to the inverse model and then uses common filter design techniques to approximate this delayed frequency response.	approximation algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);control theory;feedforward neural network;filter design;frequency response;linear time-invariant theory;robot;robotic arm;time complexity;time-invariant system;velocity (software development)	Dirk Torfs;Rudi Vuerinckx;Jan Swevers;Johan Schoukens	1998	IEEE Trans.

Steering angle is subject to two limitations - both its magnitude and rate are bounded. Although, it is the most natural settings from the application point of view - it has been rarely considered. An approach described in this paper utilizes the shortest-time solution for a 3-rd order linear system known for long time and revisited in the nineties to improve its robustness. Main generalization proposed here concerns state limitations resulting from the bounds over steering magnitude. Linear settings is sufficient if the offsets from the desired path are small. The validity of the ”linear”' solution is verified by applying the obtained optimal bang-bang control to a nonlinear system. In case of large lateral and angular offsets from the path the nonlinear analysis is needed. We show that in spite of the low dimension of the system (third) the nonlinear problem presents a variety of challenges, namely, singular optimal trajectory and a Fuller-type phenomena consisting of `chattering' near the junction of non-singular and singular portions of optimal trajectories. Finally, the controller designed using linear technique is tested with nonlinear model in simulation and experimentally.	angularjs;bang file;bang–bang control;controller (computing);experiment;full scale;lateral thinking;linear system;nonlinear system;offset (computer science);on-board data handling;optimal control;point of view (computer hardware company);simulation;ranger	Vladimir Polotski;Jerzy Z.

Therefore, a model-based methodology for online estimation of vehicle's lateral dynamics is presented, while generalizations of the Kalman Filter algorithm, the Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters are used due to the highly non-linear model behavior. The results of the introduced methodologies are presented for two different driving maneuvers and validated comparing to measurements taken with a VW Golf GTI.

Strategically, this development encompasses those electro mechanical underactuated systems which can be transformed into the so-called regular form. The novelty of this article lies in the hierarchical development of a fast terminal sliding manifold design for the considered class. Having established sliding mode against the designed manifold, the close loop dynamics becomes finite time stable which results in high precession. In addition, the adverse effects of chattering phenomenon are eliminated and the robustness of the system against uncertainties is confirmed theoretically in a couple of theorems. A comprehensive numerical example of the cart pendulum is presented to verify the claims for the considered class.	control theory;inverted pendulum;numerical analysis;robustness (computer science);underactuation	Qudrat Khan;Aamer I.

The control purpose consists of ensuring stability while performing large slew maneuvers. To this aim, a suitably accurate description of the nonlinear coupling between the rigid and the flexible motions of a spacecraft with flexible appendages is necessary. A control law from the state, ensuring global stabilization of the closed-loop solutions for any initial condition, is designed. Furthermore, considering the practical problems arising from the implementation of such a feedback, a control law from the output guaranteeing semiglobal stabilization, i.e., for any initial condition in a chosen region, is proposed. As opposite to the finite dimensional approach, which suffers the spillover effect, the proposed controllers ensure the asymptotic stabilization of all the modes.	apache continuum	Alberto De Santis;Stefano Di Gennaro	2002	Eur.

The approach proposed uses a particular form of iterative learning control (ILC) to estimate the previous disturbances, which are used as a preview of the disturbance in the next iteration. A disturbance observer is used to compensate for the difference between the ILC prediction and the true disturbance. The controller is evaluated and compared with a proportional controller, with ILC, and with an observer-based controller in extensive field trials using an automated excavator.	autonomous robot;closing (morphology);control flow;controller (computing);excavator (microarchitecture);feedback;iteration;rejection sampling;system camera	Guilherme J.

However, the airplane flying in the complicated Mars environments must address some difficult issues that are not encountered for the traditional vehicles on earth. As a result, these issues, which need to be solved, present a large design challenge for Mars airplane. In this paper, the robust adaptive control methods for Mar airplane are put forwards in order to guarantee the flight stability and improve the system robustness under the uncertain flight conditions. First, a longitudinal model of Mars airplane is established according to the different flight altitudes and velocities. Then the dynamic characteristics of this model are analyzed so as to determine the control goals. Afterwards, the robust adaptive control system is designed based on the differential geometry theory and the backstepping method such that the proposed control law can meet the anticipated mission demands. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control systems is verified by using the numerical simulation, and the corresponding results show the flight stability and the track performance can be guaranteed for Mars airplane.	autonomous robot;computer simulation;control system;numerical analysis;optimal control;recursion	Yanbin Liu;Keming Yao;Yuping Lu	2013	2013 10th IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2013.6565069	robust control;control engineering;simulation;adaptive control;numerical analysis;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.35400741626245	-15.134644186799045	194791

The isolation systems planned for use with the International Space Station (ISS) have been appropriately modeled using relative position, relative velocity, and acceleration states. In theory, frequency-weighting design filters can be applied to these state-space models, in order to develop optimal Hz or mixednorm controllers with desired stability and performance characteristics. In practice, however, since there is a kinematic relationship among the various states, any frequency weighting applied to one state will implicitly weight other states. These implicit frequencyweighting effects must be considered, for intelligent frequency-weighting filter assignment. This paper suggests a rational approach to the assignment of frequency-weighting design f'dters, in the presence of the kinematic coupling among states that exists in the microgravity vibration isolation problem.	experiment;norm (social);state space;velocity (software development)	Roy David Hampton;Mark S.

The human arm is controlled to adopt an acceptable posture in a robust optimal way. Due to the intelligent nature of human judgments, the application of the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to human judgments may be useful for emulating intelligent computation in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain in the sensorimotor control of human arm movements. In this study, we aimed to develop a robust fuzzy estimator-based control scheme to mimic the sensorimotor control of realistic planar movements of the human arm. The state variables of the planar model of the human arm are all available based on visual and proprioception information. Using posture (state) estimation based on human sensory information in the human brain, robust fuzzy estimator-based control was introduced to model the sensorimotor reference tracking control of arm movements in the presence of internal noises, state-dependent noises and environmental noises. Based on the fuzzy interpolation of a nonlinear stochastic arm system, the complex noise-tolerant robust control of the human arm tracking problem was simplified by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities using Newton?s iterative method via an interior point scheme for convex optimization. Finally, a simulation was conducted to illustrate the control procedure and to validate the performance of robust fuzzy estimator-based sensorimotor control for the human arm system.	utility functions on indivisible goods	Cheng-Wei Li;Chung-Chuan Lo;Bor-Sen Chen	2015	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2014.09.105	simulation;control theory	Robotics	63.698807405738776	-13.182045935335864	194850

This problem has received an increased interest due to the introduction of the dual-clutch powershift automatic transmission with dry clutches. This type of transmission improves fuel economy, but it results in a challenging control problem, due to driveline oscillations. These oscillations occur during gear-shift, while traversing backlash or when tip-in and tip-out maneuvers are performed. This paper presents the derivation of an accurate piecewise nonlinear drivetrain model with three inertias. Then, a horizon-1 predictive controller based on flexible Lyapunov functions is designed for the piecewise nonlinear drivetrain model. Several simulations show that the proposed control scheme can handle both the performance and physical constraints and the strict limitations on the computational complexity, while obtaining better performances compared to using PWA models of the vehicle drivetrain.	amplitude damping channel;computational complexity theory;dry loop;linear algebra;lyapunov fractal;matlab;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;performance;picasa web albums;simulation;simulink;weatherstar	Constantin Florin Caruntu	2015	2015 IEEE 20th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301442	damping;control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;torque;oscillation;computational model	Robotics	67.18656893993723	-13.032394559832158	195338

Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of this new multivariable approach for course-changing roll-regulating, and y-positional-changing yaw-regulating control when compared with a traditional multi-input single-output control approach whereby control of each degree of freedom is considered separately and hence no provision is made for the inherent cross-coupling between AUV channel motions.	autonomous robot;intelligent control	Paul J.

The test vehicle is driven on the dynamometer for driving test cycles with defined time and speed. To compare fuel consumption of various vehicles appropriately, better control performance is necessary to maintain the target vehicle speed. However, it is difficult to realize better control performance because a vehicle is a controlled system with a dead time and a large model error. In this paper, we designed a control system that realizes better control performance for the controlled system with a dead time and a large model error. First, we built the driver model from vehicle characteristics. We then designed a control system that permits the modeling error. The speed control performance of the proposed control system was confirmed by vehicle running tests with robotic driver.	broadcast delay;control system;device driver;norm (social);robot	Naoto Mizutani;Hirokazu Matsui;Ken'ichi Yano;Toshimichi Takahashi	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798627	robot;control engineering;simulation;gain;engineering;automotive engineering;force	Robotics	64.5977564200438	-14.752439064832043	196914

Consequently, for most learning schemes, the learning controllers are used as subordinates to conventional controllers or the learning process needs to be repeated each time a new trajectory is encountered, although learning controllers are considered to be capable of generalization. In this paper, we propose an approach for larger learning space coverage in robot learning control. In this approach, a new structure for learning control is proposed to organize information storage via effective memory management. The proposed structure is motivated by the concept of human motor program and consists mainly of a fuzzy system and a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC)-type neural network. The fuzzy system is used for governing a number of sampled motions in a class of motions. The CMAC-type neural network is used to generalize the parameters of the fuzzy system, which are appropriate for the governing of the sampled motions, to deal with the whole class of motions. Under this design, in some sense the qualitative fuzzy rules in the fuzzy system are generalized by the CMAC-type neural network and then a larger learning space can be covered. Therefore, the learning effort is dramatically reduced in dealing with a wide range of robot motions, while the learning process is performed only once. Simulations emulating ball carrying under various conditions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	robot learning	Kuu-Young Young;Shaw-Ji Shiah	1997	IEEE Trans.

One of the good examples is the recent nuclear disposing damage to the Japanese nuclear power plants after the earth quick occurred in the northeast of Japan. In this study, a nested fuzzy logic control system is designed for mobile robots to effectively reduce the effects of those lower-frequency nuclear radiations on rescuing robots. A coarse and a fine fuzzy controller are combined together to realize this objective. The simulation and experimental results of this study confirmed the effectiveness of this nested fuzzy control system in reduction of the effects of lower-frequency nuclear radiations on mobile robots. This is the first paper related to this topic to be presented.	fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;logic control;mobile robot;simulation	Ying Bai;Dali Wang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2012.6251240	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;computational intelligence;control theory;government;fuzzy control system	Robotics	61.4253737781628	-14.632362278283534	198282

The adaptive controller is capable to compensate for the system modeling errors and unknown payloads without deterioration of its performance. Because of the time needed to extract information from the computer images, a time delay is inherent in the calculated position of the object. This can be circumvented by predicting the position of the object so that the end effector of the manipulator can grasp it. Since the dynamics of the object are assumed to be unknown, a prediction is performed based on an autoregressive (AR) model, which is determined using the information extracted from the computer images. The information is then utilized in the controller so that the manipulator will grasp the moving object. The details of the prediction scheme are given. Control of the manipulator is reviewed. A simulation study on a manipulator for grasping a moving target using vision information and a self-tuning controller is described. The practicality of the approach is demonstrated by the laboratory experiments presented. >		Nasser Houshangi	1990		10.1109/ROBOT.1990.126048	control engineering;computer vision;parallel manipulator;systems modeling;adaptive control;computer science;artificial intelligence;mobile manipulator;control theory;information extraction	Robotics	63.18484829124822	-11.722937184752382	198451

This paper describes the development of a discrete-time model of a turbocharged engine airpath for future use in a discrete-time, model-based controller. First, a control-oriented 4-state model is developed in continuous time, but suffers from chattering after discretization. To fix this problem, a fast mode is eliminated by representing the throttle pressure ratio as a static map. This results in a 3-state model that is easily discretized for use in a discrete-time, model-based controller.	approximation algorithm;discretization;method (computer programming);responsiveness;steady state;three-state logic	Raechel Tan;Masayoshi Tomizuka	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526158	control engineering;atmospheric model;manifold;engineering;automotive engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;torque;statistics	Robotics	67.40991204226732	-12.805954366478998	198492

The control approach is based on a combination of the input-output feedback linearization control technique and the output maneuvering control approach introduced in [1]. It is shown that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and the path following error converges asymptotically to zero when an accurate car-like mobile robot localization system is available, and it is shown that when the car-like mobile robot position is not accurately estimated (for instance, under the influence of noise measurements) the closed-loop dynamics remains ultimately bounded. Numerical simulations are performed to show the overall performance of the proposed scheme in both cases.	block cipher mode of operation;computation;computational fluid dynamics;mobile robot;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;robotic mapping;simulation	Hugo Rodríguez-Cortés;Martín Velasco-Villa	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160349	computer simulation;control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.01454574824787	-15.184699788702677	198820

Lagrangian mechanics is adopted to establish a coupled mathematical model of the vehicle; when the nutation angle is sufficiently small, this model is shown to be consistent with the well-known decoupled model under two special cases. Based on the derived model with uncertainties caused by different riders, an intelligent adaptive controller is developed by using RWFCMAC, aggregated hierarchical siding-mode control and backstepping control, in order to maintain the nutation angle at zero. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed controller are exemplified by conducting several simulations on the laboratory-built omnidirectional ball-riding vehicle.	biconnected component;mathematical model;one-key mac;recurrent neural network;simulation;wavelet;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ching-Chih Tsai;Yi-Ping Ciou;Feng-Chun Tai;Shun-Feng Su;Chih-Min Lin	2014	2014 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009699	simulation;control theory	Robotics	63.96888637999711	-10.005262348476379	198957

This system alters the steering command applied to the antenna in a way that the appropriate angle commands are given to the array steering software for the antenna to point to the desired position instead of squinting. Artificial neural networks are used to develop the inverse function necessary to correct the aberration. Also a straightforward antenna steering function is implemented with neural networks for the 9-term polynomials of forward steering function. In all cases the aberration is removed resulting in small RMS angular errors across the operational angle space when the actual antenna position is compared with the desired position. The use of neural network model provides a method of producing a non-linear system that can correct antenna performance and demonstrates the feasibility of generating an inverse steering algorithm.	artificial neural network;neural networks;phased array	Young Ki Kim;Do-Hong Jeon;Chiyeon Park	2004	Int.
