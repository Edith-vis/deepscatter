To be able to adapt to the environment, cables are typically modeled as a large number of small segments that are connected via joints. The two main difficulties with this approach are to satisfy the inextensibility constraint and to handle the typically large mass ratio between the small segments and the larger objects they connect. In this paper we present a new approach which solves these problems in a simple and effective way. Our method is based on the idea to simulate the effect of the cables instead of the cables themselves. To this end we propose a new special type of distance constraint we call cable joint that changes both its attachment points and its rest length dynamically. A cable connecting a series of objects is then modeled as a sequence of cable joints which reduces the complexity of the simulation from the order of the number of segments to just the number of connected objects. This makes simulations both faster and more robust as we will demonstrate on a variety of examples.	attachments;cable modem;level of detail;optical fiber cable;simulation;solver	Matthias Müller-Fischer;Nuttapong Chentanez;Stefan Jeschke;Miles Macklin	2018	Comput.

Several methods have been proposed to generate suitable grasps for objects. Many of them are restricted to a certain type of grasp or limited to a fixed number of contacts. In this paper we propose an algorithm based on reinforcement learning, to enable a service robot to grasp every kind of object with as many contacts as needed. The proposed method will be evaluated using a simulation with a three-fingered robotic hand.	3d reconstruction;algorithm;brute-force search;online and offline;polygon mesh;reinforcement learning;service robot;simulation	Tim Baier-Löwenstein;Jianwei Zhang	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399053	robot learning;computer vision;error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;robot control;reinforcement learning	Robotics	63.00213563856603	-25.904618466354638	199222

Although many biped robots have been developed for a long time, their performances are still far from human natural performance, especially in running speed and energy efficiency. Studies of limit cycle biped robot, which focus on the high speed running and low energy cost, are considered as new approaches. Here, this paper proposes a biped robot mimicking Spring Loaded Invert Pendulum(SLIP) with inerters to improve the running performance.	asimo;limit cycle;mobile robot;performance;simulation;speedrun;zero moment point	Nhat Thanh Doan;Terumitsu Hayashi;Masaki Yamakita	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2015.7222517	control engineering;simulation;control theory	Robotics	67.0577688343425	-24.223204542989702	199651
