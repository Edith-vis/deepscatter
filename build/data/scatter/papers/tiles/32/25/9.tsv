46042c30024dbbccc8c70de38f2f958f2ae9f9bd	self-collision detection for rigid non-convex multi-link model	temporal culling;non convex multi link model;conservative advancement;surface convex decomposition;self collision detection	This paper presents an efficient algorithm to perform continuous self-collision detection for rigid non-convex multi-link model. Our algorithm precomputes the oriented bounding box (OBB) and the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) of convex hulls for each link based on the surface convex decomposition and constructs the dynamic bounding volume hierarchies with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). Given two discrete configurations of the links, we use motion interpolation between two successive time steps and check the resulting trajectory for collisions. We employ the conservative advancement and temporal culling to calculate the potentially colliding links, and adopt spatial culling to reduce the conservative advancement iterations. If collision occurs, the algorithm reports the first time of contact as well as colliding features (vertex/ face or edge/edge contacts). We implement the algorithm on the avatar model consisting of many links and tens of thousands, the results demonstrate the algorithm is efficient to perform continuous self-collision detection between the rigid non-convex multi-link model.	collision detection		2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88518-4_11	mathematical optimization;bounding interval hierarchy;simulation;mathematics;geometry;bounding volume hierarchy;collision detection	Vision	61.27611359493435	-43.10963463455552	191392

The drawback with this method is that any given surface may need to be broken into a number of such patches for it to be represented and that each patch has many design variables (i.e. control points) which would render any optimization procedure very expensive computationally. This work uses the method of surface generation proposed by Bloor and Wilson 3 and demonstrates its applicability to the problem of surface design. This method was originally developed in the field of blend generation and was later extended to free-form surface design 4. The introduction of physical and engineering constraints into the design process is thus a natural progression from the previous work. The method views the surface as the solution to a partial differential equation (PDE) and, by imposing suitable boundary	color gradient;control point (mathematics);mathematical optimization;polyhedron	T.

Of late, it has been used in different approaches to tune subdivision algorithms to handle the so-called hybrid shapes. For this the shape charts are computed numerically. In this paper, symmetries of shape charts are analyzed that can be used to simplify the computations and to reduce the computation costs significantly. © 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.	algorithm;chart;computation;numerical analysis;shape context;subdivision surface	Ingo Ginkel;Georg Umlauf	2008	Computer Aided Geometric Design	10.1016/j.cagd.2007.09.001	topology;computer aided design;mathematics;geometry;subdivision surface	Graphics	68.18587017381982	-40.55103295456748	193687

First, we propose a method which can be used to decompose a geometric constraint graph into a c-tree. With this decomposition, solving for a well-constrained problem is reduced to the solving for smaller rigid bodies if possible. Second, we give the analytical solutions to one of the basic merge patterns used to solve a c-tree: the 3A3D general Stewart platform, which is to determine the position of a rigid body relative to another rigid body when we know three angular and three distance constraints between the two rigid bodies.	angularjs;constraint graph;constraint satisfaction problem;tree decomposition;c-treeace	Xiao-Shan Gao;Gui-Fang Zhang	2003		10.1145/781606.781617	closed-form expression;mathematical optimization;rigid body;combinatorics;mathematics;assembly;geometry;stewart platform;tree decomposition	AI	64.0776555364441	-39.35855292963558	193748

5f6f73cd31b07990cf26160250789b596ba6d3da	3d computational morphology	computational geometry;shape analysis;computational morphology;computer aided geometric design	Computational Morphology is the analysis of form by computational means. This discipline typically uses techniques from Computational Geometry and Computer Aided Geometric Design. The present paper is more specifically about the construction and manipulation of closed object boundaries through a set of scattered points in 3D. Original results are developed in three stages of computational morphology: 1. impose a geometrical structure on the set o f points; 2, construct a polyhedral boundary surface from this geometrical structure; 3. build a hierarchy of polyhedral approximations together with localization information; The economic advantage of this approach is that there is no dependency on any specific data source. It can be used for various types of data sources or when the source is unknown.	approximation;computation;computational geometry;computer-aided design;geometric design;mathematical morphology;polyhedron	Remco C.

Generally, the user defines constraints on the geometric objects and a solver is applied to find a configuration of the geometry, which satisfies these constraints. Proper application of these constraints allows rapid modification of the geometry without loss of design intent.  However, in current CAD systems, constraint solving for free-form geometric objects is generally limited. In particular, constraining global features such as limits on a curve's curvature values, are not supported.  In this paper we present a general method, within the constraint-based framework, to construct global constraints on free-form curves. The method starts by defining sufficient conditions on the curves in terms of an inequality expression, unlike local constraints the global constraint expression will be defined for all the domain of the curves. We then transform the expression into a symbolic polynomial, whose coefficients are symbolic expressions of the original curves. In the final step, a set of inequality constraints is applied in terms of the symbolic coefficients. These inequality constraints enforce the positivity of the symbolic polynomial.  The final inequality constraints are fed into the solver along with any other local constraints, which the user has provided on the curves. Therefore, the solution returned by the solver satisfies both the global constraints and any other local constraints the user supplies.  We have implemented a prototype of our method using existing commercial constraint solvers. We present results on several problems, which are handled as global geometric constraints using our method.	coefficient;computer-aided design;constraint satisfaction problem;geometric modeling;global optimization;polynomial;programming paradigm;prototype;s-expression;social inequality;solver	Iddo Hanniel;Kirk Haller	2009		10.1145/1629255.1629295	standard model;constrained clustering;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;discrete mathematics;centroidal voronoi tessellation;geometric modeling;mathematics;geometry;constraint;statistics;satisfiability	Graphics	64.13077693416184	-39.6882862406097	195822

It consists of approximating the solid by variably sized cubes (octants). Since most solid modellers store the boundary representation (B-Rep) of objects, an algorithm for converting the B-Rep of the object to its octree representation will be useful in applications involving octree representation. This paper describes an algorithm for computing octree approximation of an object given its facetted B-Rep. An earlier effort classifies the octant with respect to the object to obtain the octree approximation. The algorithm proposed in this paper classifies the object entities with respect to the octant (cube). The simple structure of cubes can therefore be exploited to either totally avoid or reduce considerably, expensive operations to realize an efficient algorithm.	octree	R. Krishnan;Anupam A K Das;B.

The scope of our algorithms include physically-based models undergoing dynamic simulation subject to non-penetration constraints, variational models, deformable models used in soft object animation, geometric models including polygonal meshes, parametric surfaces such as Bézier patches and B-splines, and solid models defined by such surfaces. Our algorithms use axisaligned bounding boxes and convex hulls of the objects to identify the object pairs in close vicinity. They use subdivision, convex hull properties and linear programming to perform surface intersection tests and loop intersection tests. Frame-to-frame coherence is utilized to achieve incremental computations. The resulting algorithms have been implemented and work well in practice. In particular, we are able to compute all contacts accurately and at interactive speeds for flexible bodies undergoing second-order polynomial deformations.	algorithm;b-spline;composite bézier curve;computation;convex hull;interference (communication);linear programming;polygon mesh;polynomial;simulation;statistical interference;subdivision surface;variational principle	Merlin Hughes;Christopher DiMattia;Ming C.

3555168ff00405147b3f960cd77f5a0803eb51d4	qualitative comparison of contraction-based curve skeletonization methods		In recent years, many new methods have been proposed for extracting curve skeletons of 3D shapes, using a mesh-contraction principle. However, it is still unclear how these methods perform with respect to each other, and with respect to earlier voxel-based skeletonization methods, from the viewpoint of certain quality criteria known from the literature. In this study, we compare six recent contraction-based curveskeletonization methods that use a mesh representation against six accepted quality criteria, on a set of complex 3D shapes. Our results reveal previously unknown limitations of the compared methods, and link these limitations to algorithmic aspects of the studied methods.	algorithm;computation;computational resource;foremost;sampling (signal processing);topological skeleton;voxel	André Sobiecki;Haluk C.

Even if in the last few years its usage has significantly increased, the remarkable involvement of the operator has until now represented a significant constraint for its growth. Having regard to the fact that this process, and in particular its first step (that is the acquisition phase), strongly depends on the operator’s ability and expertise, this paper aims at proposing a strategy for automatically supporting an ‘‘optimal’’ acquisition phase. Moreover, the acquisition phase represents the onlymoment inwhich there is a direct contact between the virtualmodel and the physical model. For this reason, designing an ‘‘optimal’’ acquisition phase will provide as output an efficient set of morphological data, whichwill turn out to be extremely useful for the following reverse engineering passages (pre-processing, segmentation, fitting, . . . ). This scenario drives the researcher to use a selective sampling plan, whose grid dimensions are correlated with the complexity of the local surface region analyzed, instead of a constant one. As a consequence, this work proposes a complete operative strategy which, starting from a first raw preliminary acquisition, will provide a new selective sampling plan during the acquisition phase, in order to allow a deeper and more efficient new scansion. The proposed solution does not require the creation of any intermediate model and relies exclusively on the analysis of the metrological performances of the 3D scanner device and of the morphological behaviour of the surface acquired. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Many solutions have been proposed for morphing between two polygons. However, there has been little attention to morphing between different numbers of polygons, across a change in topology. A modified conforming Delaunay triangulation is used to build the vertex correspondence. Polygon evolution is used to smooth the morph. The morph requires no user interaction, avoids self-intersection, uses dynamic vertex correspondence, and follows nonlinear vertex paths.	delaunay triangulation;morphing	Xiaqing Wu;John K.

The authors construct a definition of a generic object category, such as a chair, in terms of the function required of the object. This definition is based on qualitative reasoning about 3-D shape, and does not imply any particular geometric or structural model for an object. Thus, this approach has the potential to lead to recognition systems of much greater generality than current CAD-based or model-based approaches. >		Louise Stark;Kevin W.
