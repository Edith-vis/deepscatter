2725938ead1ceac96f426d81fe8e6128c18c4666	fault tolerant control of an auv using periodic output feedback with multi model approach		Active thruster control is an important problem in AUV. One of the way to tackle this problem is to make the dynamic system like AUV as adaptive and self-controlling. This article discusses the fault tolerant controller design with periodic output feedback for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle using multi model approach. The entire system is modelled in state space. Assuring high degree of reliability and persisting autonomy under thruster failure the controller has to be designed such that the thrust distribution is effectively controlled if any one of the signals and corresponding thrusters fails. The AUV is modelled in six degrees of freedom having six inputs and six outputs. Four thrusters are used for vertical and horizontal movements in AUV. Fault tolerant controller is designed for depth control of AUV, with periodic output feedback gains with multi model approach. To each thruster failure the multi model is presented with the gain matrix having all off diagonal terms zero. The designed robust fault tolerant controller with periodic output feedback with multi model approach provides satisfactory stabilization to AUV depth system.	block cipher mode of operation;fault tolerance	Sneha D.

e4a24a98d687c28646ae62800dc42e368223666c	anfis-based integral terminal sliding mode control for disturbed chaotic system		An adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based integral terminal sliding (ITS) mode (ANFISITS) control is developed in this paper to deal with the disturbed chaotic systems. This ANFISITS control system is composed of an ANFIS controller and an ITS controller. The ANFIS controller is designed to approach an ideal controller and the ITS controller is designed to compensate for the approximation error between the ANFIS controller and the ideal controller; meanwhile, the ANFISITS control can cope with the disturbances. In simulations, the chaotic system control is illustrated to verify this proposed ANFISITS control system. The simulation results of the proposed control method possess better performance and robustness compared with that of fuzzy sliding parallel distributed compensation (FS-PDC) control.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;chaos theory	Yi-Jen Mon;Chih-Min Lin	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-131012	control theory	Robotics	65.19502061436444	-6.168958224654296	155688

The bounds of the disturbance are unknown, and the minimum period  T*  of the disturbance can be written as  T*  =  l*  τ , with τ being a known constant and  l*  being an unknown integer. Our proposed adaptive controller consists of a learning law and two kinds of parameter tuning mechanisms: one is the conventional parameter update law, and the other is a logic-based switching mechanism which tunes in a switching manner the saturation level and the period in the learning law. It has been proved that under our proposed control all closed-loop states are bounded and asymptotic regulation is achieved.		Xudong Ye	2012	IEEE Trans. Automat.

The overall control system is based on a Fault Detection and Diagnosis module, designed by the NonLinear Geometric Approach, allowing fault isolation. Is consists of adaptive filters based on Radial Basis Functions Neural Network, which provides the estimation of generic faults. These estimates are exploited to reconfigure the controller by means of a further feedback loop. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first application of such Active Fault Tolerant Control to an aircraft control system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, which maintains the aircraft in a safe flight envelope in case of actuator faults.	adaptive filter;artificial neural network;control system;fault detection and isolation;fault model;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant computer system;feedback;flight simulator;glide os;instrument landing system;lateral thinking;nonlinear system;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation;thrust	Paolo Castaldi;Nicola Mimmo;Silvio Simani	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6858813	control engineering;embedded system;engineering;control reconfiguration;control theory	Robotics	64.57045509330833	-8.338660887122403	156225

However, performance is poor in nonlinear systems unless combined with a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that modifies the PID controller gains as needed. System behavior can adapt to operational environment changes by switching different FLCs online. But that capability requires accurate operational environment identification. Identification must be done without human intervention in autonomous systems. This paper describes how Discrete Fourier Transforms can identify operational environments in an autonomous nonlinear system. Simulation results indicate the proposed method accurately identifies the environment and switches the correct FLC online to adapt the system's behavior.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);discrete fourier transform;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;linear system;network switch;nonlinear system;pid;simulation	Garrison W.

In this paper, the optimal control of MIMO nonlinear nonaffine discrete-time systems in input-output form is considered when the internal dynamics are unknown. First, the nonaffine nonlinear system is converted into an affine-like equivalent nonlinear system under the assumption that the higher-order terms are bounded. Next, a forward-in-time Hamilton-Jaccobi-Bellman (HJB) equation-based optimal approach is developed to control the affine-like nonlinear system using neural network (NN). To overcome the need to know the control gain matrix of the affine-like system for the optimal controller, an online identifier is introduced. Lyapunov stability of the overall system including the online identifier shows that the approximate control input approaches the optimal control with a bounded error. Finally, the optimal control approach is applied to the cycle-by-cycle discrete-time representation of the experimentally validated HCCI engine which is represented as a nonaffine nonlinear system. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in presence of actuator disturbances.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;closed-loop transfer function;date and time representation by country;experiment;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;identifier;iteration;lyapunov fractal;mimo;need to know;nonlinear system;optimal control;perturbation theory;simulation;system dynamics;usb on-the-go	Hassan Zargarzadeh;Sarangapani Jagannathan;James A.

The fault detection methodology is based on checking if measurements are inside the prediction bounds provided by a MIMO LPV model identified using real data and the parity equations approach. The proposed approach takes into account existing coupling between the different measured outputs. Modeling and prediction uncertainty bounds are handled using zonotopes. An identification algorithm that provides model parameters and their uncertainty such that all measured data free of faults will be inside the predicted bounds is also proposed. The fault isolation and estimation algorithm is based on the use of residual fault sensitivity. Finally, a case study based on a four tank system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	algorithm;estimation theory;fault detection and isolation;linear programming;mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;utility functions on indivisible goods;zonohedron	Joaquim Blesa;Vicenç Puig;Jordi Saludes	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160604	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;control theory;mathematics;fault detection and isolation;statistics	Robotics	62.593795521829726	-4.557587530736435	157201

By removing certain states and treating them as unknown inputs, a reduced-order system that is infinitely observable and compatible with existing sliding-mode observer schemes is created. A sliding-mode observer is used to estimate the states of the reduced-order system and reconstruct the fault. The existence conditions for the scheme in terms of the original system matrices are investigated and presented. Linear matrix inequality techniques are used to minimise the effect of disturbances on the fault reconstruction. Finally, a simulation is carried out and the results verify the efficacy of the proposed scheme.		Joseph Chang Lun Chan;Chee Pin Tan;Hieu Minh Trinh	2017	Int. J.

It is shown that the error has to be back-propagated through the adjoint model of the system and that the gradient can only be obtained after a delay. A faster version, accelerated back propagation, that eliminates this delay, is also developed. Various schemes including the sensitivity method are studied to update the weights of the network using these gradients. Motivated by the Lyapunov approach and the adjoint model, the predictive back propagation and its variant, targeted back propagation, are proposed. A further refinement, predictive back propagation with filtering is then developed, where the states of the model are also updated. The convergence of this scheme is assured. It is shown that it is sufficient to back propagate as many time steps as the order of the system for convergence. As a preamble, convergence of online batch and sample-wise updates in feedforward models is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach.	backpropagation;convergence (action);dynamical system;feedforward neural network;filter (signal processing);gradient;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear dynamics;nonlinear system;recurrent neural network;refinement (computing);software propagation;weight	Bhuvanesh Srinivasan;U.

Although various ILC algorithms have been proposed to compensate various nonlinear input uncertainties, a systematic design framework is still missing. This note presents a unified design framework to deal with very general nonlinear input uncertainties. The concept of a dual-loop ILC is introduced. One ILC loop (ILC Loop 1) is designed for the nominal model without nonlinear input uncertainties. The other ILC loop (ILC Loop 2) uses some iterative algorithms to handle nonlinear input uncertainties. Two ILC loops can be designed independently and are connected by a proper time-scale separation. Our first result shows that by using time-scale separation, the overall system semi-globally practically converges to the desired trajectory if ILC Loop 2 uniformly converges. Furthermore, if ILC Loop 2 converges ‘‘almost’’ monotonically, ILC Loop 1 and ILC Loop 2 can update simultaneously to achieve uniform convergence of the overall system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed CRFNN uses a compensation-based fuzzy reasoning method, and has feedback connections added in the rule layer of the CRFNN. The compensation-based fuzzy reasoning method can make the fuzzy logic system more adaptive and effective, and the additional feedback connections can solve temporal problems. The CRFNN model is proven to be a universal approximator in this paper. Moreover, an online learning algorithm is proposed to automatically construct the CRFNN. The results from simulations of identifying dynamic systems have shown that the convergence speed of the proposed method is faster than the convergence speed of conventional methods and that only a small number of tuning parameters are required. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

An algebraic identifier, which is known to be of unstable nature, is provided with an automatic disconnection strategy. The automatic disconnection is achieved by assessing an extra auxiliary parameter, called the ldquosentinelrdquo parameter that monitors the convergence of the rest of the estimated system parameters. The estimated values of mass, stiffness, and damping are realized via an algebraic estimator, with great rapidity and robustness to noise process signals present in the input and output signals. A generalized proportional integral controller was designed for a trajectory tracking task and the rejection of a constant disturbance input. The switched implementation of the average input in the form of a bounded discontinuous control signal is based on the use of a Sigma- Delta modulator. In an average sense, this modulation allows us to preserve the desirable features of the dynamic output feedback controller and to be close to a real implementation. The efficiency of the complete procedure is demonstrated via digital computer simulations.	additive white gaussian noise;block cipher mode of operation;computer simulation;control theory;delta-sigma modulation;estimation theory;feedback;identifier;input/output;linear algebra;linear system;nonlinear system;rejection sampling;signal-to-noise ratio;smoothing;utility functions on indivisible goods	Carlos García-Rodriguez;John Cortés-Romero;Hebertt Sira-Ramírez	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2026383	computer simulation;identification;damping;control engineering;mathematical optimization;convergence;computer science;engineering;control system;trajectory;delta-sigma modulation;signal processing;automatic control;control theory;feedback;mathematics;tracking;estimation theory;suspension	Robotics	66.60639754071714	-6.711527720994023	159600

Proportional (P) controller is the simplest and most intuitive structure for the implementation of linear control systems. The difficulty to find the stability range of feedback systems with P controllers, using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, increases with the order of the plant. For high order plants, the stability range cannot be easily obtained from the investigation of the coefficient signs in the first column of the Routh's array. A direct method for the determination of the stability range is presented. The method is easy to understand, to compute, and to offer the students a better comprehension on this subject. A program in MATLAB language, based on the proposed method, design examples, and class assessments, is provided in order to help the pedagogical issues.

d70c5cfb18799f006e589d3f0b714f204fd5a1e2	an adaptive pid control algorithm for nonlinear process with uncertain dynamics		The control objective is to maintain level in a conical tank which is a highly nonlinear process having varying dynamics. The classical PID control scheme finds it difficult to implement a proper control action when process switches between operating regions. Hence dynamic set of controller parameters are required to enhance the performance of the controller. Eventually this leads to drifting of controller parameters which makes stability a critical phenomenon. Hence an adaptive algorithm which updates the controller parameters automatically based on the operating conditions is required. In this paper, this task is achieved with an adaptive controller where adaptation is done with the help of fuzzy rule-base.	algorithm;nonlinear system;pid	A. S. Wincy Pon Annal;S.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Rough Set reduction by using control science viewpoint. In this model, information system is regarded as controlled plant, user’s preference about attributes is regarded as control objective, and the iterative algorithm designing process is regarded as control law designing. We have investigated the properties of Rough Set reduction based on control approach, and have designed the control system based on the properties, where single attribute set and user specified attributes are all used as core attributes to control a pruning process, and other core attributes worked out by previous steps are also used, iteratively. Such that it forms a dynamic closed-loop control by which the user can give much more interactivities. We have also implemented the experimental platform, and the experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient and effective. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Then fuzzy rules are used to express the knowledge and embedded in the controller to direct the dynamic control process. Under this controller, the systemic requirement of high-level outputs of the actuators is limited to a great extent, at the same time the convergent performance is optimized by a fuzzy-sets method from which the saturated fault tolerant control is realized in robotic manipulators.

The scheme here considered embeds a finite family of pre-designed controllers and a high-level unit which selects, at each instant of time, the candidate controller to be placed in feedback to the uncertain plant. The study considers a switching strategy where controller selection is based onwindowed cost functions. The key feature of the proposed strategy is that the window (the memory) is not kept constant, but, on the contrary, is adjusted on-line, on the grounds of measured data. The potential benefits of using an adaptive memory switching strategy are discussed and illustrated through a benchmark example. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By employing fuzzy logic systems to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and combing with the indirect adaptive fuzzy switching controller design procedure, the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all the closed-loop signals are boundedness, and the output of the systems converges to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectory. Finally, simulation results have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. It has also been shown that the convergence of parameters and output tracking errors are smoother and faster with the proposed scheme, compared with the conventional adaptive fuzzy control methods.	adaptive switching;approximation	Lei Yu;Shumin Fei;Lining Sun;Jun Huang;Yunlong Zhu	2015	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-014-9866-6	control engineering;mathematical optimization;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.65128856901606	-5.593323530328226	161609

During the online control process, the identification of system is not necessary, because of learning ability of the proposed controller. One of the proposed controller features is robustness to different operating conditions and disturbances. The test power system is a two-area two-machine system power.

This result is then used to demonstrate that the negative feedback connection of plants composed of two strictly positive real subsystems in cascade can follow external inputs with tracking errors that can be made arbitrarily small by applying a sufficiently large feedback gain. We utilize this result to design a biomolecular feedback regulation scheme for a synthetic genetic sensor model, making it robust to variations in the availability of a cellular resource required for protein production.	block cipher mode of operation;dynamical system;negative feedback;nonlinear system;synthetic intelligence	Abdullah Hamadeh;Eduardo D.

For unknown system dynamics, the single-hidden-layer feedforward network is employed for approximation which provides the information for the disturbance observer. Based on composite learning using neural approximation and disturbance estimation, the terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) is synthesized to obtain the finite-time convergence performance. To overcome the singularity problem, nonsingular TSMC is proposed. The closed-loop system stability under the two proposed controllers is presented via Lyapunov approach and the system trajectory will converge to the region caused by approximation error and disturbance estimation error. Simulation results demonstrate that the composite learning can efficiently estimate the system uncertainty and the tracking performance under the proposed controllers can be enhanced.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;consensus dynamics;converge;fault tolerance;feedforward neural network;lyapunov fractal;simulation;system dynamics;technological singularity;velocity (software development)	Bin Xu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2017.2698473	control theory;sliding mode control;control theory;intelligent control;feed forward;terminal sliding mode;approximation error;mathematics;lyapunov function;control system	Robotics	64.83958562409693	-6.973861333685599	164378

The proposed method can be used in synchronization if nonlinear chaotic systems can be transformed into the canonical form of Lur'e system type by the differential geometric method. In this approach, the adaptive fuzzy-neural network (FNN) in AFNO is adopted on line to model the nonlinear term in the transmitter. Additionally, the master's unknown states can be reconstructed from one transmitted state using observer design in the slave end. Synchronization is achieved when all states are observed. The utilized scheme can adaptively estimate the transmitter states on line, even if the transmitter is changed into another chaos system. On the other hand, the robustness of AFNO can be guaranteed with respect to the modeling error, and external bounded disturbance.

Full state measurements are unavailable. We first show that via a coordinate transformation, the unknown control coefficients are lumped together and the original switched nonlinear system is transformed into a new switched nonlinear system for which control design becomes feasible. Second, for the new switched nonlinear system, based on backstepping, we design output-feedback controllers for subsystems and construct a common Lyapunov function, which rely on the designed state observer, to guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system under arbitrary switchings. Finally, as an application of the proposed design method, global stabilisation of a mass-spring-damper system is achieved by output feedback.	block cipher mode of operation;coefficient;nonlinear system	Lijun Long;Jun Zhao	2013	Int.

A new switched adaptive control technique for the problem studied is set up by exploiting the generalized multiple Lyapunov functions method and the parameter separation technique. Different update laws are designed to reduce the conservativeness caused by adoption of a common update law for all subsystems. Also, the proposed technique permits removal of a common restriction in which the parameterization in the switched systems is restricted to a linear parameterization. As an application of the proposed design technique, stabilization for a class of non-triangular switched systems with nonlinear parameterization is achieved by design of adaptive controllers. Since no subsystem of such a switched system is assumed to be adaptively stabilizable, the problem under study cannot be handled by the existing methods. A two inverted pendulums as a practical example is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.	control theory;nonlinear system	Lijun Long;Zhuo Wang;Jun Zhao	2015	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2015.02.004	control engineering;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	67.71861120178195	-3.4335908990200763	165440

Asymmetric actuator failures are considered and, in order to accommodate them, a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm which takes into account nonlinearities, aerodynamic and gyroscopic couplings, state and control limitations is implemented. This algorithm computes new trims such that around the new operating point, the faulty linearized model remains nearby from the fault free model. For the faulty linearized models, linear state feedback controllers based on an eigenstructure assignment method are designed to obtain soft transients during accommodation. Real time implementation of the SQP algorithm is also discussed.	aerial photography;algorithm;audio control surface;control theory;fault tolerance;gyroscope;nonlinear system;operating point;sequential quadratic programming;unmanned aerial vehicle	François Bateman;Hassan Noura;Mustapha Ouladsine	2008	2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2008.4738946	remotely operated underwater vehicle;control engineering;atmospheric model;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;gyroscope;aerodynamics;engineering;linear model;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	66.09429016221239	-8.4132611450126	165582

The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Pole Placement (PP) techniques are combined in a TS fuzzy structure in order to guarantee an optimal controller with satisfactory transient response based on poles allocated properly. The definition and analysis of the multiobjective feasible region, considering the influence of the desired poles on the weighting matrices Q andR in the quadratic cost function, are presented.

aabd04a6d861f5c685262e797c3fdc42049da0f6	active fault tolerant control design approach for the flexible spacecraft with sensor faults		In this paper, the problem of active fault tolerant control (FTC) is studied for a class of flexible spacecraft attitude systems with Lipschitz nonlinearity and sensor fault. Firstly, a functional observer is designed for the attitude systems of flexible spacecraft in order to detect the time of unknown sensor fault occurred. Next, the sensor fault estimation is performed by filtering the output estimation error, as usually done in the residual generation framework. Then, a dynamic output feedback-based FTC approach is proposed to the flexible spacecraft in sensor faulty case, it not only attenuates flexible appendage disturbance with a given level γ, but also tolerates the effect of unknown sensor fault. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed FTC method is demonstrated in the attitude systems of flexible spacecraft subject to a time-varying sensor fault.	block cipher mode of operation;fault tolerance;nonlinear system;pitch (music);sensor;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link;yaws	Zhifeng Gao;Bing Han;Guoping Jiang;Jinxing Lin;Dezhi Xu	2017	J.

The cascaded plant consists of the dynamics of surge motion of an AUV, that of the propeller axial flow, that of the propeller shaft and that of the electrically-driven circuit. Uncertainties including modeling errors and external disturbances are taken into account simultaneously. A hybrid control strategy is proposed to the cascaded system with uncertainties. An on-line robust neural-network is used to compensate the modeling errors while L2-gain design is used to suppress the external disturbances. By backstepping method, the terminated control input to the thrust system is obtained. Design of the controller with L2-gain performance observes the recursive Lyapunov function method, which guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded stability of tracking system. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of controller proposed.	thrust	Wei-lin Luo;Zao-jian Zou	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21090-7_66	tracking system;lyapunov function;computer science;machine learning;errors-in-variables models;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	65.91614022087903	-9.720231234340817	166828

The fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and an adaptive fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. By utilizing the adaptive fuzzy observer, and combining the fuzzy adaptive control theory with backstepping approach, an adaptive fuzzy output feedback control approach is developed. The proposed control approach can guarantee that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SUUB), and the observer error and tracking error are proved to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Two simulation examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback;hysteresis;mimo;nonlinear system	Yongming Li;Shaocheng Tong;Tieshan Li	2012	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2012.04.004	mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.68565440095459	-5.352384152405516	167173

The predicted congestion information is backward to the node. NLMS and neural network are used as the predictive control functions, and they are compared from performance on the queue length prediction. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method compared to the feedback control method without the prediction. Therefore, we conclude that the efficient congestion and stability of the queue length controls are possible using the prediction scheme that can resolve the problems caused from the longer delays of the feedback information.	least mean squares filter	Malrey Lee;Dong-Ju Im;Sung Su Park;Jung-sik Lee;Jaewan Lee	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45226-3_112	control engineering;real-time computing;computer science;control theory	Robotics	63.77703503451117	-7.9935570456263845	167977
373ed647a0b1c27d4d2c7dc48c8f314c5c5176f3	a new kind of nonlinear disturbance observer for nonlinear systems with applications to cruise control of air-breathing hypersonic vehicles	high order nonlinear disturbance observer;robustness;air breathing hypersonic vehicle;nonlinear system	ABSTRACTThe nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) proposed by W. H. Chen et al. needs an assumption that the disturbance varies slowly relative to the observer dynamics (i.e. d˙(t)≈0), so as to ensure the convergence of the disturbance observer. When d˙(t)≠0, however, there is no guarantee of the convergence in theory. To solve the problem, this paper presents a new NDO, namely high-order nonlinear disturbance observer (HONDO), for a nonlinear system with an unknown fast time-varying disturbance (i.e. d˙(t)≠0). The HONDO not only inherits all the advantages of the usual NDO, but also guarantees the convergence of the estimated error for a nonlinear system with a fast time-varying disturbance. Therefore, the HONDO proposed in this paper broadens the application scope of the conventional NDOs, thus is a supplement to the theory of NDO. The numerical simulation for the cruise control of an air-breathing hypersonic vehicle further verifies the effectiveness of the HONDO-based control.	artificial intelligence;control theory;higher-order function;lam/mpi;nonlinear system;simulation;switch statement	Zhiling Yang;Bin Meng;Hongfei Sun	2017	Int.

These approaches are directly or indirectly based on the use of the internal model principle and the Youla-Kučera parametrization combined with an adaptive law. All the algorithms associated with these approaches make the assumption that the plant zeros are different from the poles of the disturbance model to achieve disturbance compensation. However, in practice, the problem is more intricate since it is not clear what happens if the plant has very low-damped complex zeros (often encountered in mechanical structures) and the frequency of the disturbance is close to the antiresonance frequency (the resonance frequency of the plant zeros). In this brief, we comparatively evaluate in simulation and in real time on a benchmark test bed two different approaches to deal with the low-damped complex zeros of the plant. An evaluation of the combination of the two approaches is also presented.	algorithm;amplifier;benchmark (computing);feedback;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;resonance;simulation;testbed	Abraham Castellanos Silva;Ioan Doré Landau;Petros Ioannou	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2015.2445859	control engineering;benchmark;electronic engineering;sensitivity;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;robustness;polynomial;actuator	Visualization	67.53919315463301	-9.877319473451374	168419

The structural feature of uncertain delta operator system is concerned. Soft sliding mode controller design for continuous-time system and discrete-time system can be converted to the case of delta operator system. The stability of uncertain delta operator soft sliding mode control (SMC) system is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability theory. Soft sliding mode controller design for uncertain delta operator systems is achieved by the proposed reaching law under a certain matching condition. It is illustrated that delta operator soft SMC system by the proposed reaching law in a simulation example can not only reach the scope of the switching plane in limited time, but also reduce system chattering effectively. The system on stability and process steady is better than that of delta operator exponential reaching law and delta operator variable rate reaching law. At the same time, the system has a good completely robustness compared with delta operator statured reaching law.	delta operator;digital signal processing;discrete-time signal;lyapunov fractal;sampling (signal processing);sigmoid function;simulation;time complexity	Yunlong Liu;Yonggui Kao;Wencheng Wang;Zairui Gao	2015	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-015-2018-5	real-time computing;computer science;machine learning;control theory;sigmoid function	Robotics	64.67640821344257	-9.142280806195538	168553

The IMWNN is employed to implement the feed-forward control, and obtain the inverse dynamics model of the process. The SNLC is adopted to carry out feedback control, and assure the stability of closed loop system and restrain the disturbances. The WNNI is used to identify the model of plant and adjust the parameters of SNLC. In simulation, the roll mode input-output signals to train the wavelet neural network off-line are obtained by introducing PRBS sequence. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, and prove that the hybrid control can make sure the stability and robustness of control system and effectively improve the system adaptive ability. This method not only can be applied to ship roll-reducing control, but also can be used in other complexity, non-linearity system control.	approximation;artificial neural network;closed-loop transfer function;complexity;control system;experiment;feed forward (control);feedback;input/output;inverse dynamics;neuron;nonlinear system;online and offline;pseudorandom binary sequence;simulation;wavelet	Hui Li;Chen Guo;Donghong Yin	2011	2011 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR)	10.1109/SoCPaR.2011.6089262	control system;control theory;feedback;feed forward;wavelet transform	Robotics	62.73236194381236	-9.65029575536578	168842

Real-time feedback control over network is also investigated with a ball magnetic-levitation (Maglev) system as a test bed. We devised a novel timeout scheme and derived an autoregressive (AR) prediction model for delayed/lost sensor data. By applying this timeout and prediction scheme to the cases of consecutive data loss, we showed that the test bed could survive sporadic delays of as long as three sampling periods without losing stability. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed network-based real-time control methodologies was demonstrated experimentally.	autoregressive model;broadcast delay;client–server model;common gateway interface;control theory;experiment;feedback;html;heisenbug;real-time cmix;real-time clock;real-time web;sampling (signal processing);sensor;server (computing);testbed;timeout (computing)	Won-jong Kim;Kun Ji;Abhinav Srivastava	2006	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2005.859630	control engineering;real-time computing;computer science;networked control system;engineering;control theory;feedback	Robotics	64.02413304838267	-7.943154938627665	169271

SNAC uses only a single critic neural network instead of the action-critic dual network architecture of typical adaptive critic designs. SNAC eliminates the iterative training loops between the action and critic networks and greatly simplifies the training procedure. The performance of the proposed PSS has been tested on a Single Machine Infinite Bus test system for various system and loading conditions. The proposed stabilizer, which is relatively easier to synthesize, consistently outperformed stabilizers based on conventional lead-lag and linear quadratic regulator designs.	artificial neural network;computation;ibm power systems;iterative method;network architecture;physical symbol system;small-signal model	Gurunath Gurrala;Radhakant Padhi;Indraneel Sen	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178588	linear-quadratic regulator;network architecture;adaptive control;computer science;operant conditioning;mathematical model;control theory;electric power system;artificial neural network	Arch	61.827614934286096	-9.292556269087969	169373

Compared with the existing results, the restrictions on the time-delayed functions are overcome, and the unknown delay parameters are estimated by establishing the piecewise adaptive laws. Based on the delay estimations and the backstepping technique, a novel adaptive fuzzy memory output feedback controller is designed. For the analysis of stability, the cubic Lyapunov functions with absolute value are constructed. It is proved that the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin.

In DFC, the information about a position in the state space is unnecessary if the period of the unstable periodic orbit to stabilize is known. There exists the fault that DFC cannot stabilize the unstable periodic orbit when a linearlized system around the periodic point has an odd number property. There is the chaos control method using the prediction of the -time future state (PDFC) proposed by Ushio et al. as the method to compensate this fault. Then, we propose a method such as improving the fault of the DFC. Namely, we combine DFC and PDFC with parameter W, which indicates the balance of both methods, not to lose each advantage. Therefore, we stabilize the state into the periodic orbit, and ask for the ranges of Wand gain K using Jury' method, and determine the quasi-optimum pair of (W, K) using a genetic algorithm. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a discrete-time chaotic system, and show the efficiency through some examples of numerical experiments.	chaos control	Michio Miyazaki;Sang-Gu Lee;Seong-Hoon Lee;Kageo Akizuki	2003	Int.

The response of the valve to setpoint changes under different working conditions and its disturbance behaviour are presented by some experimental results, which are clearly illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	algorithm;closed-loop transfer function;control theory;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;mathematical model;nonlinear system;optimal control;reference model;setpoint (control system)	Steven Lambeck;Christian Busch	2010	IEEE ICCA 2010	10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524434	ventilation;control engineering;atmospheric model;magnet;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;proportional control;automatic control;mathematical model;control theory;transfer function	Robotics	65.93944170687367	-7.907336829719431	171067
4e278f104e1edc70548426c4fa373ebf891886fd	design of feedback gain in feedback-based iterative learning control		Feedback loops have been introduced in iterative learning control (ILC) to improve the performance in the time domain. This in turn affects the convergence performance in the iteration domain. Such an impact on ILC performance has not been rigorously analysed in the literature. In this paper, the concept of dynamic influence in the iteration domain is introduced to characterise the impact of feedback in the convergence of ILC algorithms. An optimal feedback gain is thus designed in order to minimise such an impact with the help of nominal model, leading to an improvement of the transient response in the iteration domain. The result also reveals a clear performance trade-off between the robustness of the system in time domain and the transient response in iteration domain.	algorithm;control theory;gradient;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;negative feedback;online and offline;optimal design;system camera;unified framework	Gijo Sebastian;Ying Tan;Denny Oetomo;Iven M.

The system consists of an interconnection of components that are subject to failure. A component fault occurs when one or more of the component parameters change. The paper describes a scheme for: 1) detecting when one of the components fail, 2) identifying the failed component and 3) under certain conditions accommodating the failure by controller tuning. The problem is compounded by the restriction that only the inputs and outputs of a limited number of components can be measured. Therefore it is not possible to directly determine the diagnostic parameters using parameter identification theory. The detection problem is solved using an observer. The isolation (FDI) problem is posed as a pattern classification problem that is solved using the Bayes decision strategy and a geometric analysis. Once a fault is isolated we show how a linear feedback controller may be tuned to minimize an integral squared error performance criterion using a gradient-based algorithm.	autonomous robot;control system;control theory	Rajamani Doraiswami;Chris Peter Diduch;Joel Kuehner	1998		10.1109/ICSMC.1998.725117	mathematical optimization;error detection and correction;decision theory;adaptive control;geometric analysis;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;fault detection and isolation	Robotics	64.34037863035802	-8.032883371816027	171420

The controller is also tested with embedded attitude control hardware on a spherical air bearing system and compared with a PID controller and 2nd and 3rd order sliding mode controllers. The proposed controller is more tolerant to faults and uses less energy for attitude control, and has a steady-state error of 0.8 degrees while PID accuracy in the same system is 5 degrees.	control system;embedded system;fault tolerance;optimal control;pid;simulation;steady state	Junquan Li;Mark A.

The neural network identification scheme is combined with the traditional adaptive critic technique, in order to design the nonlinear robust optimal control under uncertain environment. First, the robust optimal controller of the original uncertain system with a specified cost function is established by adding a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system. Then, a neural network identifier is employed to reconstruct the unknown dynamics of the nominal system with stability analysis. Hence, the data-based adaptive critic designs can be developed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the transformed optimal control problem. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is also proved by using the Lyapunov approach. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed control strategy.	algorithm;artificial neural network;bellman equation;control theory;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;identification scheme;identifier;iteration;jacobi method;loss function;lyapunov fractal;markov decision process;nonlinear system;optimal control;reinforcement learning;simulation;system dynamics;usb on-the-go;unmanned aerial vehicle	Ding Wang;Derong Liu;Qichao Zhang;Dongbin Zhao	2016	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2015.2492941	robust control;mathematical optimization;optimal control;adaptive control;system identification;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network;robustness;intelligent control	Robotics	62.76766906681611	-3.0423921420021958	172225

Based on the input/output feedback linearization method, the relationship between reference output and control output is established. Then a sliding mode controller is designed to reject the influence of external disturbance and system uncertainties on the system performance and compelled the current dynamic output exponentially stabilized at their reference states. In order to eliminate the inherent harmful chattering phenomenon of sliding mode controller, a high-slope saturation function is used to replace the discontinuous sign function in the sliding mode manifold design. Several simulations with respect to the dynamic analysis of HGRS system without controller, fixed point stabilization, periodic orbit tracking and robustness test against random noises have been carried out to test the effectiveness of the proposed controller technique. The results show that the proposed sliding mode controller improves the nonlinear HGRS system performance with an accurate precision and a shorter time in all cases. The nonlinear hydraulic generator regulating system (HGRS) model is studied.This kind of HGRS system considers the external disturbances and system uncertainty.The input/output feedback linearization method is used to establish the relationship.Sliding mode controller (SMC) is applied to adjust the orbit output of HGRS system.PID controller is employed to the adjustment process in HGRS system as a comparison.	block cipher mode of operation;input/output	Xiaohui Yuan;Zhihuan Chen;Yanbin Yuan;Yuehua Huang;Xianshan Li;Wenwu Li	2016	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2015.08.020	control theory	EDA	66.73997675316556	-7.194983843636456	173514

Conventional model-referenced adaptive control is used as the basis of comparison of the performance of two knowledge-based techniques. Fuzzy logic is used to represent the knowledge base of these techniques, and the compositional rule of inference is used for decision making. In one knowledge-based technique, the parameters of a low-level direct digital controller are adapted by the inference engine so that the physical system tracks a reference model, which specifies the desired performance. In the other knowledge-based technique, the reference input to the system is adapted to achieve the desired performance, as specified by a reference model. Both analytical and practical details of the development and implementation of the adaptive control techniques are systematically presented. Development of the knowledge base is described. Representative experimental results from the three techniques, as applied to a prototype fish cutting machine are given. The performance of the techniques is evaluated on the basis of the developmental experience and the experimental results.

The optimal tracking problem is transformed into an equivalent optimal regulation problem through a feedforward adaptive control input that is generated by modifying the standard backstepping technique. Subsequently, a neural network-based optimal control scheme is introduced to estimate the cost, or value function, over an infinite horizon for the resulting nonlinear continuous-time systems in affine form when the internal dynamics are unknown. The estimated cost function is then used to obtain the optimal feedback control input; therefore, the overall optimal control input for the nonlinear continuous-time system in strict-feedback form includes the feedforward plus the optimal feedback terms. It is shown that the estimated cost function minimizes the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman estimation error in a forward-in-time manner without using any value or policy iterations. Finally, optimal output feedback control is introduced through the design of a suitable observer. Lyapunov theory is utilized to show the overall stability of the proposed schemes without requiring an initial admissible controller.

Related to the system nonlinearity, the stability of observer dynamic with static and dynamic gain is considered. The advantage of using dynamic gain to deal with large Lipschitz nonlinearity is discussed and it is proved that no dynamic gain can stabilise the observer for a larger Lipschitz constant as compared with the static gain. However, a nonlinear observer with dynamic gain has some additional degrees of freedom which can be utilised to attenuate noise effect on the observer behaviour. Using mixed     and     criteria, this article introduces a method to obtain a dynamic gain which can deal with system nonlinearity and noise simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed method is finally demonstrated by some simulation results.	nonlinear system	Mohsen Ekramian;Farid Sheikholeslam;Saeed Hosseinnia	2013	Int. J.

The first one is based on the recursive least square algorithm where the second one is synthesized around the direct Lyapunov theory. The rapidity of convergence and dynamic precision of these parameter estimators are studied and compared when an unforeseeable rotor resistance default affects the model of the studied system. The Validity and the robustness of both proposed estimators will be demonstrated via a simulation study. A performance synthesis of the studied estimators will be performed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of both estimators. This will lead to proceed to a future design and implementation of an online guaranteed stability default detection mechanism.	algorithm;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;r.o.t.o.r.;recursion;recursive least squares filter;simulation	Sondess Ben Aoun;Nabil Derbil	2009	2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSYN.2009.83	computer science;computational intelligence;dc motor;control theory	Robotics	64.25771307944315	-8.75587811621919	176661

For cost reasons, a current trend in industry is consolidating multiple applications on a single embedded platform. Generally, to deal with inter-application interference, a predictable scheduling policy allocates resource to the applications in these platforms. Realizing an equidistant sampling scheme on such shared platform is inflexible and often turns out to be expensive in terms of resource or conservative in terms of performance. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibilities to relax the equidistant sampling convention. To this end, recent results show that platform timing properties can be represented by a known, precise, and periodically varying set of sampling periods. In view of such predictable platforms, a framework is presented for analysis and synthesis of lifted domain feedforward controllers for periodically time-varying closed-loop systems. Through simulations the potential of such periodically time-varying sampling over conservative equidistant sampling schemes is demonstrated.	computer performance;embedded system;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;interference (communication);nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);simulation;system camera	Jurgen van Zundert;Tom Oomen;Dip Goswami;W.

The engine cooling system belongs to a special class of nonlinear systems with both matched and mismatched state-dependent lumped disturbances. The parameter update laws resemble a nonlinear reduced-order disturbance observer and guarantee the convergence of the estimated parameter values to the true ones. In each recursive design step, only a single parameter update law is required for each lumped disturbance in contrast to the standard adaptive backstepping control based on overparametrization and tuning functions. An experimental analysis on a dedicated test rig highlights the effectiveness of the proposed novel adaptive backstepping control in terms of asymptotic tracking, global stability and guaranteed parameter convergence.	angularjs;computer cooling;experiment;nonlinear system;optimal control;recursion;velocity (software development)	Saif Siddique Butt;Robert Prabel;Jisheng Zhang;Harald Aschemann	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525422	control engineering;mathematical optimization;convergence;backstepping;computer science;engineering;adaptive system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.92345789023516	-8.761804059105499	177000
f2b1c00dfdf314647a69a29abcf1e404862e86a0	developing nonlinear adaptive optimal regulators through an improved neural learning mechanism		Optimal feedback design of dynamical systems is a significant topic in automatic control community and information science. As for nonlinear systems, optimal control design always leads to coping with the nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Nevertheless, it is intractable to acquire the analytic solution of the nonlinear Hamilton-JacobiBellman equation for general nonlinear systems. As a result, some promising iterative methods have been established to deal with the optimal control problems in recent years. Among them, adaptive/approximate dynamic programming [1] is regarded as a typical method for designing optimal control adaptively and forward-in-time [2, 3]. In the last two decades, the methodology of adaptive/approximate dynamic programming has progressed significantly in the aspect of optimal control for complex nonlinear systems [4–7]. This considerably promotes the development of the adaptive critic control designs of complex nonlinear systems. However, the traditional adaptive critic control design always depends on the choice of an initial stabilizing control, which is considerably difficult to determine in control practices. This highlight focuses on developing nonlinear adaptive optimal regulators through an improved neural learning mechanism. In this highlight, R stands for the set of all real numbers. R is the Euclidean space of all n-dimensional real vectors. R is the space of all n × m real matrices. Let Ω be a compact subset of R and A (Ω) be the set of admissible control laws on Ω. Superscript “T” is considered for representing the transpose operation and ∇(·) , ∂(·)/∂x is employed to denote the gradient operator. Problem description.

For a given sufficiently smooth reference signal, our aim is to design a controller which achieves that the tracking error evolves within a prespecified performance funnel. To this end, we introduce a new controller which involves the first r− 1 derivatives of the tracking error, where r is the strict relative degree of the system. We further present some simulations where our funnel controller is applied to a mechanical system with higher relative degree and compare it with other approaches.	nonlinear system;simulation	Thomas Berger;Huy Hoàng Lê;Timo Reis	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2017.10.017	control theory;mathematics;funnel;nonlinear system;control theory;manipulator;tracking error;adaptive control	Robotics	66.62852045531623	-5.9679468682649865	177267

The problem, under standing minimum phase and solvability of regulator equations conditions, has not been well solved in the literature. It has attracted many researchers to contribute efforts to build solutions, however only partially from different aspects, mostly utilizing adaptive internal models. The bottleneck is that the usual adaptive approach is not suitable for recursive implementation due to the so-called “propagation of uncertainties” while recursion is usually indispensable for global control of lower triangular systems. This motivates the present development of an expanded and “nonadaptive” internal model based design framework. As a major consequence, we are able to avoid propagation of uncertainties and establish a constructive solution for the problem.	minimum phase;nonlinear system;propagation of uncertainty;recursion;software propagation;triangular matrix	Xinghu Wang;Zhiyong Chen;Dabo Xu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2017.2738150	mathematical optimization;control theory;internal model;triangular matrix;mathematics;recursion;nonlinear system;minimum phase;regulator;bottleneck	Visualization	66.76038924516173	-2.9299674644244162	177426

This result, which was derived earlier for the case when the state vector of the plant can be measured, is extended in this paper to the case when only the input and the output of the plant are accessible. This information, in turn, is used to describe different stable strategies for controlling the adaptive system.	adaptive system;convex hull	Zhuo Han;Kumpati S.

The nonlinear structure is specially suited to describe some electric motors, and the ideas here developed can be applied to design more reliable variable speed drives. The AFTC scheme departs from a nominal control law previously designed. The fault diagnosis and isolation (FDI) structure is carried out in two stages. First, a fault condition is detected, and next a fault isolation and identification is performed. Hence, according to the FDI structure, the control algorithm can follow four scenarios: (i) operate in open-loop, (ii) replace missing/erroneous sensors by virtual ones, (iii) adjust the references for a faulty actuator, and (iv) reconfigure the control law. The application to a DC motor in parallel configuration is illustrated, and the evaluation is carried experimentally in a 2 HP test-bed.	algorithm;experiment;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;identification scheme;input/output;nonlinear system;optimal control;requirement;sensor;testbed	Diego Rivelino Espinoza-Trejo;Daniel U.

First, a general form of a disturbance observer is proposed when full states are available. Then, by combining a state function estimator of minimal order, an output-based disturbance observer is derived. The existence condition will be formulated in the form of a static output feedback. Through examples, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach will be demonstrated. A servo control problem in practice is addressed to show the validity of the approach. Furthermore, it will be shown that the proposed approach does provide a smaller order of disturbance observer than that of conventional approaches, while maintaining satisfactory performances. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A transition mechanism between the PI and PD type fuzzy-neural controllers modifies the control law adaptively. The gradient descent algorithm is used to train the FNN in direct adaptive control scheme.

Actuator faults are considered on this paper. The basic idea behind the proposed method is to estimate the faults signals using the extended state observers theory. To estimate the faults, a polynomial observer is presented by using the available measurements and know inputs of the system. In order to investigate the observability and diagnosability properties of the system, a differential algebra approach is proposed. Furthermore, an evaluation function depending on the system states is developed, in order to be used in a controller, which will compensate the failures. The effectiveness of the methodology is illustrated by means of numerical simulations and some experimental tests.		Gerardo R.

The open-loop system using the designed FO controller is with a flat-phase feature around the gain crossover frequency, which obtains the robustness to loop-gain variations. Thus, the control performance can be made uniform with more consistency than the optimized traditional integer-order controller when the loop gain changes. The theoretical foundation of the FO controller design is presented first. Thereafter, the implementation details of the designed controller in the real-time HDD servo system are introduced, which are important for the real applications of the FO controllers in practice. From the experimental validation, the presented FO-PD controller and the design synthesis are found to be efficient in improving the track-following control performance for the HDD servo system.	audio crossover;data model;frequency response;hard disk drive;phase margin;real-time transcription;servo;throughput;tracking system;triple modular redundancy	Ying Luo;Tao Zhang;Bongjin Lee;Changik Kang;Yangquan Chen	2014	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2013.2239111	control engineering;open-loop controller;real-time computing;controller;engineering;control theory	Embedded	67.55421235184303	-8.820781237019554	179876

A modified backstepping approach is proposed by the use of high-gain k-filters, hyperbolic tangent function property and bound-estimation approach to compensate for the effect of possible number of actuator failures up to infinity and input quantization. It is proved both mathematically and by simulation that, all the signals of the closed-loop system are globally bounded despite of input quantization and possible number of actuator failures up to infinity.	distributed control system;nonlinear system	Wakeel Khan;Yan Lin;Sarmad Ullah Khan;Nasim Ullah	2018	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.09.011	infinity;backstepping;actuator;mathematics;nonlinear system;plant;quantization (signal processing);adaptive control;bounded function;control theory	Robotics	67.13352308143804	-4.351441031863488	180360

We will derive the Fuzzy Mappings (FMs) of the IT2-FLCs and then investigate how the IT2-FMs are affected by the CSCMs in terms of the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) parameters. We will also present a special case where the resulting FM of the KM reduces to its NT counterpart and show that the NT CSCM can be seen as an approximation of the KM CSCM. We will examine three different FOU parameter settings to show that for certain FOU parameter settings the IT2-FLC where the NT CSCMs is employed loses its FOU from a mathematical point of view. We will also present two necessary conditions for the design of the IT2-FLC so that the resulting controller has a symmetrical control surface and is capable to eliminate the steady state error of the system response. Then, by taking account these conditions, we will investigate the gain variations of the IT2-FLCs in terms of the control performance objectives. Based on the observations, we will recommend design guidelines for the IT2-FLCs. The presented results will show that although the NT CSCM has a relatively easier design phase and a closed form representation which might be an enabler for theoretical analyses of the IT2 FLCs, the KM CSCM seems to be superior in overall since it is capable to generate smooth and aggressive control actions which cannot be accomplished by its NT counterpart.	approximation;audio control surface;fm broadcasting;fuzzy logic;interval arithmetic;mendel palace;os-tan;steady state	Ahmet Sakalli;Tufan Kumbasar	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2015.7337873	fuzzy logic;frequency modulation;uncertainty;design methods;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;steady state;statistics	Robotics	62.3604094992118	-6.647947635097526	180965

This design methodology is an extension of the so called Inversion Formulae method for the design of classical Lead, Lag, Notch and PI/PD/PID controllers. PIDF controllers are useful because, differently from standard PID controllers, they are described by a proper transfer function. In this paper we also show that the further degree of freedom introduced in the transfer function of the PIDF controller can be exploited to satisfy further specifications, compared to the classic PID controller.	audio crossover;pid;requirement;steady state;transfer function	Stefania Cuoghi;Lorenzo Ntogramatzidis	2014	2014 4th Australian Control Conference (AUCC)	10.1109/AUCC.2014.7358695	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	EDA	61.36426572477237	-6.107571006611375	181029

Because the nonlinear property and the unknown functions are included in the considered reactor, it leads to a completed task for designing the controller. Based on the approximation property of the neural networks, several unknown functions are approximated. The main contribution of this paper is that a more general class of CSTR is controlled. A novel recursive design method is used to remove the interconnection term. It is proven that the proposed algorithm can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the system output can converge to a neighborhood of zero based on the Lyapunov analysis method. A simulation example for continuous stirred tank reactor is illustrated to verify the validity of the algorithm.	artificial neural network;reactor (software)	Dongjuan Li	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2013.11.006	continuous stirred-tank reactor;real-time computing;adaptive control;control theory	ML	65.60108719137064	-5.086522518622163	181093

The controller is formulated to prevent both symmetric as well as asymmetric output constraint violations. The dynamic inversion control philosophy is used to formulate the controller. However, unlike dynamic inversion, error dependent gains are chosen in the proposed control formulation, which leads to a nonlinear closed loop error dynamics. The barrier Lyapunov function is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the closed loop error dynamics. It is shown that the system output will remain bounded by the chosen constraints and all other close loop states will also remain bounded. The effectiveness of the controller is illustrated through extensive simulation results.

A new fuzzy reasoning method is proposed that employs an explicit feedback mechanism to improve the robustness of fuzzy reasoning. The fuzzy rule base given a priori serves as a controlled object, and the fuzzy reasoning method serves as the corresponding controller. The fuzzy rule base and the fuzzy reasoning method constitute a control system that may be open loop or closed loop, depending on the underlying reasoning goals/constraints. The fuzzy rule base, the fuzzy reasoning method, and the corresponding reasoning goals/constraints define the three distinct ingredients of fuzzy reasoning. While various existing fuzzy reasoning methods are essentially a static mapping from the universe of single fuzzy premises to the universe of single fuzzy consequences, the new fuzzy reasoning method maps sequences of fuzzy premises to sequences of fuzzy consequences and is a function of the underlying reasoning goals/constraints. The Monte Carlo simulation shows that the new fuzzy reasoning method is much more robust than the optimal fuzzy reasoning method proposed in our previous work. The explicit feedback mechanism embedded in the fuzzy reasoning method does significantly improve the robustness of fuzzy reasoning, which is concerned with the effects of perturbations associated with given fuzzy rule bases and/or fuzzy premises on fuzzy consequences. The work presented in this paper sets a new starting point for various principles of feedback control and optimization to be applied in fuzzy reasoning or logical inference and to explore new forms of reasoning including robust reasoning and adaptive reasoning. It can be also expected that the new fuzzy reasoning method presented in this paper can be used for modeling and control of complex systems and for decision-making under complex environments.	complex systems;control system;embedded system;feedback;fuzzy rule;map;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;rule-based system;simulation	Kai-Yuan Cai	2008	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2007.896275	fuzzy logic;opportunistic reasoning;complex systems;qualitative reasoning;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;computer science;control system;fuzzy subalgebra;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;model-based reasoning;machine learning;control theory;feedback;mathematics;fuzzy associative matrix;reasoning system;deductive reasoning;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control language;fuzzy control system	AI	62.70914323994901	-5.8391901019034345	181431

Its performance is compared to an existing heuristically tuned nonlinear controller in closed-loop experiments on a test road in first gear.	control theory;electronic control unit;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;heuristic;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;simulation;state space;system identification	Andreas B.

cc9ef7b3dc0b55b2ec7f9e8a95242d8bd1d35537	nonlinear decoupling control with anfis-based unmodeled dynamics compensation for a class of complex industrial processes		Complex industrial processes are multivariable and generally exhibit strong coupling among their control loops with heavy nonlinear nature. These make it very difficult to obtain an accurate model. As a result, the conventional and data-driven control methods are difficult to apply. Using a twin-tank level control system as an example, a novel multivariable decoupling control algorithm with adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based unmodeled dynamics (UD) compensation is proposed in this paper for a class of complex industrial processes. At first, a nonlinear multivariable decoupling controller with UD compensation is introduced. Different from the existing methods, the decomposition estimation algorithm using ANFIS is employed to estimate the UD, and the desired estimating and decoupling control effects are achieved. Second, the proposed method does not require the complicated switching mechanism which has been commonly used in the literature. This significantly simplifies the obtained decoupling algorithm and its realization. Third, based on some new lemmas and theorems, the conditions on the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are analyzed to show the uniform boundedness of all the variables. This is then followed by the summary on experimental tests on a heavily coupled nonlinear twin-tank system that demonstrates the effectiveness and the practicability of the proposed method.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;algorithm;cns disorder;control flow;control system;control theory;controllers;convergence (action);coupling (computer programming);embedded system;embedding;estimated;execution unit;inference engine;mathematical model;nonlinear system;urban dictionary	Yajun Zhang;Tianyou Chai;Hong Wang;Dianhui Wang;Xinkai Chen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2691905	process control;multivariable calculus;control theory;decoupling (cosmology);adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;uniform boundedness;computer science;nonlinear system;control theory;control system	Robotics	65.7001015000234	-6.475500230451285	182328
a2e12f9eb581e71513a885e9823c5a34b18afdcd	improving the performance of networked control systems with time delay and data dropouts based on fuzzy model predictive control		Abstract This paper proposes a fuzzy model predictive control (FMPC) combined with the modified Smith predictor for networked control systems (NCSs). The network delays and data dropouts are problems, which greatly reduce the controller performance. For the proposed controller, the model of the controlled system is identified on-line using the Takagi – Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models based on the Lyapunov function. There are two internal loops in the proposed structure. The first is the loop around the FMPC, which predicts the future outputs. The other is the loop around the plant to give the error between the system model and the actual plant. The proposed controller is designed for controlling a DC servo system through a wireless network to improve the system response. The practical results based on MATLAB/SIMULINK are established. The practical results are indicated that the proposed controller is able to respond the networked time delay and data dropouts compared to other controllers.	broadcast delay;control system	Ahmad Sakr;Ahmad M.

By using a high gain observer to reconstruct the system states, an extension is made to output feedback neural-network control of nonaffine systems, whose states and time derivatives of the output are unavailable. It is shown that output tracking errors converge to adjustable neighborhoods of the origin for both state feedback and output feedback control.	approximation;arabic numeral 0;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;block cipher mode of operation;converge;feedback;neural network simulation;nonlinear system;soft-in soft-out decoder;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon	Shuzhi Sam Ge;Jin Zhang	2003	IEEE transactions on neural networks	10.1109/TNN.2003.813823	index term;nonlinear control;adaptive control;nonlinear system;computer science;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	64.64404407186727	-6.435162780257162	182556

In our approach, by using the prior knowledge about the plant, the adaptive law is driven only by the states of unknown subsystems. Moreover, we demonstrate by simulations that incorporating the partial knowledge about the system improves the response of the system in terms of tracking error and response time.	control system;diagram;formal verification;interconnection;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);parallel computing;response time (technology);settling time;simulation;state-space representation;transfer function	Rasul Mohammadi	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346701	real-time computing;adaptive control;computer science;control system;mathematical model;control theory	Robotics	65.1632363619694	-5.1289365517839265	182801
f0157389b05dcb0f64018f4744d7fc6d84df8979	reduced-order k-filters based decentralized fuzzy adaptive control of stochastic large-scale nonlinear systems with stochastic input unmodeled dynamics		This paper addresses a decentralized fuzzy adaptive control scheme for stochastic large-scale systems in the presence of stochastic input unmodeled dynamics, which is a novel problem on the research of unmodeled dynamics. The stochastic nonlinear input unmodeled dynamics is restricted to be stochastic input-to-state stable. We introduce changing supply function to deal with the stochastic input unmodeled dynamics and construct the corresponding small gain condition. Due to partial states unavailable for measurement and control gains unknown, we design reduced-order K-filters to estimate the unmeasurable states only. First type fuzzy systems are adopted to approximate the whole of the black-box functions and the unknown continuous system functions, which can degrade the complexity of calculation and simply the K-filters’ structure. Utilizing the changing supply function, dynamic surface control (DSC) method and Chebyshev’s inequality, a strict stability analysis in probability is made. The analysis shows that the control laws can guarantee all the signals to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in mean square or the sense of four-moment. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This induces some compromises (actuator saturation, comfort, road holding...) which need to be taken into account in the control design step. In this paper, a state feedback input constrained control problem for LPV systems is considered with H∞ performance objective. Stabilization conditions based on the Finsler's Lemma are derived in order to ensure the stability in the presence of the input saturation, and to attenuate the disturbance effects. To this aim, two different Lyapunov functions are used. For the stability analysis, a generalized sector condition for LPV systems is applied to treat the nonlinearity caused by the actuator saturation. The considered performance objective regards the reduction of the ℒ2 gain from the disturbance to the controlled output. The LPV controller is computed from the solution of LMIs considering a polytopic representation for the LPV closed-loop system. These theoretical results are applied to a semi-active suspension system where the dissipativity conditions of the semi-active dampers are recast as saturation conditions on the control inputs. The comfort criteria is used as a performance objective in this study. Some simulation results are presented in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This paper proposes an adaptive frequency-shaped sliding mode control (AFSSMC) algorithm to deal with such disturbances. The proposed AFSSMC incorporates a peak filter with varying central frequencies to shape the sliding surface and thus provides on-line frequency-dependent control allocation. An extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate both the states and the disturbances. The disturbance estimate is utilized to identify the peak frequencies of the disturbance and adaptively tune the peak filter in AFSSMC; the state estimate is utilized to generate the control signal. The evaluation is performed on a simulated hard disk drive, and the effectiveness is validated.	algorithm;control system;disk storage;elegant degradation;hard disk drive;noise shaping;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;rejection sampling;simulation	Minghui Zheng;Masayoshi Tomizuka	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2016.7576872	control engineering;variable structure control;electronic engineering;sliding mode control;engineering;control theory;state observer	Robotics	67.6764905236754	-9.530175470959229	184154

The current regulator of the PMSM is the innermost loop of its electromechanical driving system and plays an important role in the control hierarchy. When the PMSM runs precisely at high speeds, the cross-coupling terms must be compensated for. In the proposed RMRAC, the input signal is composed of the control voltage obtained by the model reference adaptive control (MRAC) law and the output of the disturbance estimator. The gains of the feedforward and feedback controllers are estimated by the proposed modified gradient method, where the system disturbances are filtered out by the estimated current regulation error. A voltage corresponding to the estimated system disturbances is fed forward to the control input in order to filter out the disturbances. The proposed method compensates the cross-coupling terms in a synchronous current model regardless of parameter variations. It also shows a good real-time performance due to the simplicity of control structure. Through simulations and real experiments, the efficiency of the proposed method is verified.	control flow;current source;elegant degradation;experiment;feedforward neural network;gradient method;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;statistical model	Hongzhe Jin;JangMyung Lee	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.928554	control engineering;electronic engineering;adaptive control;engineering;control system;control theory;feed forward	Robotics	66.74697012719746	-9.570456205648211	184912

This paper focuses on developing an alternative approach to FD for airspeed sensor in UAVs by using data from gyros, accelerometers, global positioning system, and wind vanes. Based on the kinematics model of the UAV, an estimator is proposed to provide analytical redundancy using information from the above-mentioned sensors, which are commonly implemented on UAVs. This filter process is independent of the airspeed measurement and the aircraft dynamics model. Furthermore, we employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives and prove that the nonlinear system describing the airspeed kinematics is observable. The  $\chi ^{2}$  test and cumulative sum detector are employed to detect the occurrence of airspeed measurement faults together. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology has been evaluated through flight experiments of UAVs.	aerial photography;experiment;fault detection and isolation;global positioning system;nonlinear system;observable;sensor;system of measurement;system safety;unmanned aerial vehicle;utility functions on indivisible goods	Dingfei Guo;Maiying Zhong;Donghua Zhou	2018	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2017.2735663	estimator;control engineering;redundancy (engineering);mathematics;kinematics;observability;sensor fusion;fault detection and isolation;accelerometer;airspeed	Robotics	62.35390192905555	-5.097470510032576	185630

Based on dynamic surface design and common Lyapunov function method, an adaptive approximation design methodology for the decentralized adaptive tracking is proposed to ensure that the total controlled closed-loop system is asymptotically bounded and the local output tracking performance is maintained within preselected time-varying bounds independent of switched interactions. For this decentralized tracker design, an auxiliary nonlinear function is introduced to overcome the interaction problem of unknown switched nonlinearities. Contrary to the related results in the literature, the proposed new design approach firstly deals with the switched interactions among switched subsystems in the non-affine form, ensures the transient performance at switching instants within preselected bounds, and does not require the information on the signs of control gain functions. A simulation example is provided to show the effectiveness of the resulting decentralized control system.	approximation;nonlinear system	Sung Jin Yoo	2017	J.

c04db166c2658c90d8fd7f881da18f9244753edc	a small-gain-type improved criterion via preservation of iiss/iss dissipation inequalities		This paper pursues a stability criterion by which better Lyapunov functions establishing stability of interconnected nonlinear systems can be constructed. Component systems are assumed to be integral input-to-state stable (iISS). Although the iISS small-gain condition in the literature is a necessary and sufficient condition in an appropriate sense, the Lyapunov function constructed for the interconnected system by the existing results is virtually unusable when stability margins are small. To identify the origin of the undesirable feature, this paper investigates techniques of iISS preservation. For developing a powerful remedy, the usage of the Legendre-Fenchel transformation in the preservation is generalized to remove all unnecessary assumptions used in previously existing results. The development is useful for establishing input-to-state stability of an interconnection from iISS components.	control theory;convex conjugate;interconnection;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;usability	Hiroshi Ito	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963235	control theory;inequality;computer science;control engineering;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;dissipation;stability criterion	Robotics	68.25482753062096	-3.0828247791119177	187131

Following a rule base, the fuzzy switching scheme effectively monitors changes in operating conditions or such drastic changes in plant. A fuzzy inference engine then fires appropriate rules, which gives a fuzzified output value. Defuzzification is then performed to switch the reference model in a predefined domain. The whole process is conducted on line, monitoring the plant auxiliary inputs at selected control intervals. The main contribution of the paper is that the proposed fuzzy switching scheme can be performed online and is very well suitable for multi modal jump systems. Unlike, static multiple model algorithms for switching (non-interacting individual model-based filters) or switching dynamic algorithms (susceptible to numerical overflow), this scheme provides an interactive multiple model environment with soft switching. The scheme is computationally feasible, effective and efficient. The proposed scheme is applied to an example system with disturbed model parameters to show its effectiveness.	algorithm;defuzzification;dynamic problem (algorithms);fuzzy logic;inference engine;interaction;modal logic;numerical analysis;parameter (computer programming);reference model;rule-based system	Sukumar Kamalasadan;Adel A.

All adjustable parameters are tuned by the on-line learning mechanism with time varying learning rate. This variation of learning rate is introduced by main theorem to improve the system performance and stabilization. Furthermore, the convergence of adjustable parameters is guaranteed through the on-line learning and membership functions properties.

eb70a780d183edb2be70b3b6e5dd44af2f1a3344	robust h-infinity tracking control of mimo nonlinear systems. application to non-isothermal cstr		A non-isothermal Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is the most important element of chemical industrial equipment which exhibits a highly nonlinear behavior. It is one of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems affected by disturbances. The operation of the non-isothermal CSTR is disturbed by external factors such as changes in the inlet concentration and temperature. Therefore, the two difficult issues in CSTR control are tracking trajectory and external disturbance attenuation. In this paper, a robust fuzzy tracking control via Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) MIMO systems is designed to robustly stabilize the non-isothermal CSTR system for both concentration and temperature schemes exposed to external disturbances. Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy approach for describing nonlinear model with several local linear models is proposed, and using a technique called Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC), we derive LMI conditions for analyzing robust stability and performance based on Lyapunov functions, and a criterion is employed to guarantee the attenuation of disturbances. In trajectory tracking framework, an integral action is introduced as a new state variable. Finally, simulation results are given to prove that the proposed technique ensures the stability conditions and guarantees robustness against external disturbance with a good trajectory tracking.	fuzzy logic;linear matrix inequality;linear model;lyapunov fractal;mimo;mimo-ofdm;nonlinear system;peripheral dma controller;reactor (software);simulation	Bzioui Sana;Channa Rafik	2017	2017 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)	10.1109/ICCAIS.2017.8217592	attenuation;control engineering;engineering;robustness (computer science);control theory;state variable;linear model;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;continuous stirred-tank reactor;h-infinity methods in control theory	Robotics	65.41093417498351	-5.756355372531554	189071

The main contribution is that an integrated analytic framework is proposed for automated fuzzy neural network structure selection, parameter identification and hysteresis network switching with guaranteed neural identification performance. Firstly, an automated support vector machine is proposed within a fixed time interval for a given network construction criterion. Then the network parameter updating algorithm is proposed with guaranteed bounded identification error. To cope structure uncertainty, a hysteresis strategy is proposed to enable fuzzy neural identifier switching with guaranteed network performance along the switching process.

To improve these limitations this paper presents a combined control structure in which the conventional P-control law is used in parallel with a modified fuzzy SOC algorithm. To run the algorithm fast, the inference mechanism of the fuzzy rules is simplified by modifying the SOC algorithm. Addition of the P-control law is made in the feedforward path to guarantee stability at initial stage before the rules are completely created. To test the performance of the proposed control scheme and structure, a series of experiments were performed using a PUMA-760 robot. The experimental results show that the proposed structure can be effectively applied to the control of robot manipulators when implemented to the personal computer. >	fuzzy control system;organizing (structure);robot;self-organization	Kyoung Chul Koh;Hyung Suck Cho;Seoung Kyun Kim;I.

The subsystems are in the form of triangular structure. First, we design a reduced-order observer independent of time delay to estimate the unmeasured state variables online instead of the traditional full-order observer. Then, a new state transformation is proposed in consideration of the prescribed performance requirement. Using neural network to approximate the composite unknown nonlinear function, the corresponding decentralized output tracking controller is designed. It is strictly proved that the resulting closed-loop system is stable in probability in the sense of uniformly ultimately boundedness and that both transient-state and steady-state performances are preserved.

This kind of system is divided into two subsystems, and two sub-sliding planes are designed respectively for them. A total sliding plane is then constructed using these two sub-sliding planes. A control law is derived from Lyapunov law to make the system reach the total sliding plane, and sequentially the two subsystems slide into their own sliding planes. Adaptive fuzzy logic systems, with parameter optimized using a genetic algorithm, are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. The asymptotic stability of all sliding planes is proved theoretically. The validity of this control method is also proved by a simulation of an inverted pendulum system.	approximation algorithm;control theory;formal system;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;inverted pendulum;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation;underactuation	Shuai Li;Dian-Tong Liu;Pei-Jin Wang	2013	2013 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890466	mathematical optimization;sliding mode control;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system	Robotics	63.246301262067675	-7.251094822296759	191953
0b456147e84558919a9c8d782749c4d2b994d7e5	an input-delay event-triggered control design for nonlinear systems		The paper proposes a novel event-triggered control scheme for nonlinear systems based on the input-delay method. Specifically, the closed-loop system is associated with a pair of auxiliary input and output. The auxiliary output is defined as the derivative of the continuous-time input function, while the auxiliary input is defined as the input disturbance caused by the sampling or equivalently the integral of the auxiliary output over the sampling period. As a result, it forms a cyclic mapping from the input to the output via the system dynamics and back from the output to the input via the integral. The event-triggering law is constructed to make the mapping contractive such that the stabilization is achieved and an easy-to-check Zeno-free condition is provided. Within this framework, we develop a theorem for the event-triggered control of interconnected nonlinear systems which is employed to solve the event-triggered control for lower-triangular systems with dynamic uncertainties.	computer simulation;display lag;emoticon;input/output;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);system dynamics	Lijun Zhu;Zhiyong Chen;David J.

The processed signals from a SMO are found to be the output of a fictitious system which treats the faults and disturbances as inputs; the ‘outputs’ are then fed into the next SMO. This process is repeated until the attainment of a fictitious system which satisfies the conditions that guarantee DDFR. It is found that this scheme is less restrictive and enables DDFR for a wider class of systems compared to previous work when only one or two SMOs were used. This paper also presents a systematic routine to check for the feasibility of the scheme and to calculate the required number of SMOs from the outset and also to design the DDFR scheme.

Fictitious reference iterative tuning (FRIT) in two-degree of freedom (2DoF) control structure is used to control the position of the mass of the vibrating system. With 2DoF-FRIT, we can not only control the system but also estimate the plant model simultaneously. We use this merit and propose a new approach in which Kautz expansion is used to approximate the mathematical model of the vibrating system. To show the validity of our proposed method, an illustrative example using the actual parameters of the vibrating system is shown with simulation results.	approximation algorithm;control flow;input/output;iterative method;mathematical model;simulation	Hnin Si;Osamu Kaneko	2017	2017 11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2017.8287537	natural frequency;architecture;control theory;input/output;mathematics	Robotics	67.60522957112507	-8.88859185394993	192614

Fuzzy logic systems are directly used to tackle unknown nonlinear functions, and the adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is constructed by using the backstepping recursive design techniques. To overcome the problem of input saturation, a new auxiliary design system and Nussbaum gain functions are incorporated into the control scheme, respectively. It is proved that the proposed control approach can guarantee that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. A simulation example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Two key advantages of the scheme are that (i) the direct adaptive fuzzy control method is proposed for uncertain nonlinear system with input saturation by using Nussbaum function technique and (ii) The number of the online adaptive learning parameters is reduced.	approximation algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;computable function;control theory;formal system;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;nonlinear system;recursion;semiconductor industry;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder	Yongming Li;Shaocheng Tong;Tieshan Li	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-0993-3	mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;adaptive control;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;control theory;mathematics;saturation	Robotics	65.8051804859632	-5.016793509163539	192921

Based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) design approach, a class of decentralized local fixed state feedback controllers with additive gain perturbations is established. The novel contribution of this paper is that in order to reduce the large cost caused by the LMI conditions, the fuzzy controllers are substituted for the additive gain perturbations. Although the fuzzy controllers are included in the uncertain large-scale systems, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. As another important feature, the control input matrices allow uncertainty and the conservative assumption is not needed compared with the existing result that is based on the neural networks. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed controller, the simple numerical example is given.	artificial neural network;fuzzy concept;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;numerical analysis;robust control;social inequality;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hiroaki Mukaidani;Minoru Kimoto;Toru Yamamoto	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2006.1681778	robust control;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;linear matrix inequality;computer science;control theory;mathematics;stability theory;gain scheduling;artificial neural network	Robotics	65.57101500592864	-4.21867547041122	193781

This paper addresses a novel MOR technique for multi-input multi-output system with dominant eigenvalue preservation, which leads to controller cost minimization. The new technique is formulated based on an artificial neural network (ANN) prediction of an upper triangular form of the system state matrix A. Using the new system state matrix along with the linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization method, a permutation matrix is obtained which leads to the new formulation of the complete system considered for MOR. Utilizing the non-projection state residualization technique, a reduced model order is obtained. The proposed ANN-LMI-based MOR method is compared with well-known reduction techniques such as the balanced Schur decomposition, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and state elimination through balanced realization.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is an effective health monitoring tool which can achieve acceptable results only for linear processes. In the case of nonlinear systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles, kernel PCA approach can be used which leads to more accurate health monitoring and fault diagnosis. In order to achieve fault isolation, partial KPCA is proposed where a set of residual signals is generated based on the parity relation concept. The simulation studies demonstrate that using the proposed methodology, the occurrence of sensor faults in the nonlinear six degrees of freedom (DOF) model of an AUV can be effectively detected and isolated.	autonomous robot;fault detection and isolation;kernel (operating system);kernel principal component analysis;nonlinear system;sensor;simulation;six degrees of separation	Mania Navi;Mohammad Reza Davoodi;Nader Meskin	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)	10.1109/ICPHM.2015.7245022	control engineering;embedded system;engineering;control theory	Robotics	62.75858677615096	-4.947851590618224	194968

The dynamics of the isotope separation process is difficult to model precisely using integer order transfer functions; thus, a fractional order approach is preferred. The objective of this work is to design two different PI controllers—a classical one and a fractional order one—and test their closed loop performance under nominal conditions as well as gain uncertainties. Since the process is represented by a fractional order mathematical model, the simplest approach to design both controllers is based on a frequency specification. For the fractional order of the PI controller and its parameters, the authors solve a system of equations that includes a robust performance specification to gain uncertainties. For the classical PI controller, a traditional tuning algorithm based on phase margin specification is implemented. The simulation results show that both controllers meet the design specifications, with the fractional order PI controller behaving more robustly to plant gain variations.	algorithm;closed-loop transfer function;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);phase margin;settling time;simulation	Eva-Henrietta Dulf;Cristina-Ioana Pop;Francisc-Vasile Dulf	2012	Signal, Image and Video Processing	10.1007/s11760-012-0335-z	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	66.0294149956353	-3.600744550265086	195357

The estimators are developed to be resilient to sensor measurement inaccuracies, model and tire parameter uncertainties, switchings in observer gains, and measurement failures. More particularly, the stability of the observer is investigated, and its robustness to road condition uncertainties and sensor noises is analyzed. The sensitivity of the observers’ stability and performance to the model parameter changes is discussed. Moreover, the stability of the velocity observers for two cases of arbitrary and stochastic switching gains is investigated. The stochastic stability of the observer in the presence of faulty measurements is also studied, and it is shown that if the probability of a faulty measurement occurring is less than a certain threshold, the observer error dynamics will remain stochastically stable. The performance of the observer and the effect of the SC are validated via several road experiments.

The sequence of direct implementation usually consists of three steps: simple simulation experiment, real time communication with the real process and monitoring of the control algorithm after implementation. The direct implementation enables us to describe the quantization effect. The issue of quantization effect disturbance given by A/D and D/A converters is often forgotten. This paper shows the second and the third implementation step where the first one was described in the 10th Zittau Fuzzy Colloquium. The advantage of identification based on neural networks in adaptive LQ controller that overcomes presented problem is introduced below.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;artificial neural network;letter-quality printer;quantization (signal processing);simulation	Kamil Svancara;Petr Pivoñka	2003			thermal insulation;control theory;cementitious;quantization (signal processing);enclosure;composite number;control theory;mechanical engineering;materials science	Robotics	61.87251548789142	-9.625927617095131	195808

The proposed output feedback controller employs a dynamic gain which is tuned adaptively by monitoring the output value. As a result, a priori knowledge on the linear growth rate and delay size are not required in controller design, which is a clear benefit over the existing results.	block cipher mode of operation;display lag;feed forward (control);input/output;nonlinear system	Ho-Lim Choi;Jin-Soo Kim;Jae-Seung Youn;Kwon Soon Lee	2009	IEICE Transactions		mathematical optimization;a priori and a posteriori;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics	Visualization	67.57521833112915	-4.313555973036567	195882

A pre-inverse type ANC is proposed in order to solve the problem. The proposed ANC uses the filter which has the inverse transfer function of a secondary path before the secondary path. Whereas the filtered-x algorithm controls a primary path and a secondary path simultaneously by an adaptive filter, the pre-inverse type ANC can control a primary path and a secondary path independently. Therefore the proposed ANC is always stable. However, the adaptive filter estimating a secondary path converges on a solution with bias due to disturbance. Thus, the bias free adaptive algorithm is also proposed. The proposed adaptive algorithm takes advantage of the independence between the input signal and disturbance.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;adaptive system;control theory;dither;exponent bias;noise reduction;simulation;transfer function	Yusaku Tanaka;Naoto Sasaoka;Yoshio Itoh;Masaki Kobayashi	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272010	adaptive filter;control engineering;computer vision;electronic engineering;kernel adaptive filter;computer science;noise;active noise control;noise reduction;control theory;mathematics;transfer function	EDA	67.68402699702547	-5.716973566278377	196008

The fuzzy controllers are derived from their conventional continuous time domain controllers. The controllers are developed by first discretizing the controllers' laws and then progressively deriving the steps necessary to incorporate a Fuzzy logic control mechanism into the modifications of the controllers' structure. The resulting controller is a discrete-time Fuzzy version of the conventional controller, which has the same linear structure in proportional, integral and derivative parts but has non constant gains. Analytical structures for the Fuzzy controllers using 'Gaussian' Membership functions are derived. The final version of this Fuzzy controller is a computationally efficient over its conventional counter part. Computer simulations are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fuzzy controller over its counterpart conventional PID Controller.	algorithmic efficiency;domain controller;fuzzy concept;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;logic control;nonlinear system;pid;simulation	P.

fa9e50630c4faf522094c680d210a18cde12a82f	an adaptive constrained control for a class of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties		In this paper, based on an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (ABLF) and the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique, we develop an adaptive constrained control scheme to address the constraints on the output for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertainties. The proposed controller guarantees the boundedness of output constraints and the asymptotic stability with online parameter adaption in the transient response. This method has the advantage of setting initial conditions subject to flexible constraints by using the ABLF, if compared with those obtained from quadratic Lyapunov function. Moreover, the DSC is introduced to eliminate repeated differentiation resulting from the ABLF synthesis and to construct a simple controller. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method not only quickly estimates the unknown parameters with robustness against uncertainties but successfully ensures the output constraints never violated. Simulation results illustrate that the output constraints is satisfied through a numerical example.	initial condition;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;petri net;simulation	Baoyin Wang;Yanan Qiu;Zhiyong Dai;Shuguang Zhang	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963522	control engineering;control theory;robustness (computer science);control theory;nonlinear system;numerical stability;parametric statistics;exponential stability;lyapunov redesign;lyapunov function;mathematical optimization;mathematics	Robotics	66.86931828311243	-3.964204871239963	196866

The actuator dynamics, due to a broad range of motion trajectories, have different degrees of nonlinearity and are represented by a number of linear models with associated bounds of unmodeled dynamics. For each specified range of motion trajectories, a robust performance controller corresponding to the particular linear model is designed to ensure consistent performance under the effect of nonlinear dynamics in the range. A repetitive controller and a feedforward controller are added as plug-ins to the robust performance feedback controller.

Meanwhile, it is shown that the proposed control approach can be used to design SOSM controllers under disturbances bounded by positive functions rather than conventional constant upper bounds.

The air/fuel ratio is essential for torque generation together with emissions and requires therefore a precise regulation. The system dynamics are modeled for controller design as a first order linear parameter-varying (LPV) system plus parameter varying time delay where the time delay is approximated by a first order Padé function. The scheduling signals determined by the engine operating point are reduced to a single scheduling parameter. The functional dependence on the plant parameters stored in look-up tables is then approximated by rational functions of this scheduling parameter. For controller synthesis a mixed sensitivity design (four-block) is used with parameter dependent weighting to adjust the requirements to the varying plant dynamics. An LPV controller with guaranteed stability and induced ℒ2-norm performance is then obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) on a prespecified grid. Simulation results are presented to validate the designed LPV controller. They show performance superior to that of a scheduled PID controller used in serial production cars.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);broadcast delay;input/output;linear matrix inequality;lookup table;operating point;pid;padé approximant;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensitivity and specificity;simulation;system dynamics;transfer function	Erik Schulz;Matthias Schultalbers;Herbert Werner	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525425	control engineering;atmospheric model;real-time computing;engineering;control theory;combustion	EDA	61.48162536138464	-4.844065807872709	197696

For sensor faults, an adaptive controller is designed based on an output-feedback control scheme. The feedback controller gain is determined in order to stabilize the closed-loop system in the fault free case and vanishing disturbance, while the additive gain is updated using an adaptive law to compensate for the sensor faults and the external disturbances. To correct the actuator faults, a state-feedback control method based on adaptive mechanism is considered. The both proposed controllers depend on the singular perturbation parameter e leading to ill-conditioned problems. A well-posed problem is obtained by simplifying the Lyapunov equations and subsequently the controllers using the singular perturbation method and the reduced subsystems yielding to an e-independent controller. The control scheme, designed based on the Lyapunov stability theory, guarantees asymptotic stability in presence of additive faults and external disturbances provided the singular perturbation parameter is sufficiently small. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

Firstly, the error caused by the time-varying delays is modeled as a disturbance and a novel method of bounding the disturbances is proposed. Then, a robust one step ahead predictive controller based on flexible control Lyapunov functions is designed, which explicitly takes into account the bounds of the disturbances caused by time-varying delays and guarantees also the input-to-state stability of the system in a non-conservative way. Moreover, it is shown that by choosing an appropriately Lyapunov function, the MPC algorithm amounts solving a single, low-complexity linear program each sampling instant. The modeling method and the control strategy were tested on a vehicle drivetrain controlled through CAN, with the aim of damping driveline oscillations, which is crucial in improving driveability and passenger comfort. Several True-Time simulations based on realistic scenarios show that the proposed control scheme can handle both the performance/physical constraints and the strict limitations on the computational complexity.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;control theory;linear programming;lyapunov fractal;norm (social);performance;physical plant;sampling (signal processing);simulation;telecommunications network	Constantin Florin Caruntu;Corneliu Lazar	2011	ETFA2011	10.1109/ETFA.2011.6059062	control engineering;control-lyapunov function;real-time computing;lyapunov function;engineering;linear programming;control theory;computational complexity theory;oscillation;model predictive control	Robotics	66.29047567482225	-7.5836794207955265	197835

The methodology is based on adaptive filters obtained via a nonlinear geometric approach, which allows to obtain interesting decoupling property with respect to uncertainty affecting the wind turbine system. The residual generation scheme exploits the on-line estimation of the actuator fault signal generated by the adaptive filters. The nonlinearity of the wind turbine model is described by the mapping to the power conversion ratio from tip-speed ratio and blade pitch angles, usually not known in analytical form. The wind turbine unit is considered as benchmark to show the design procedure, including the aspects of the nonlinear disturbance decoupling method, as well as the viability of the proposed approach. Extensive simulations of the benchmark process are practical tools for assessing experimentally the features of the developed actuator fault diagnosis scheme, in the presence of modelling and measurement errors.	adaptive filter;approximation;benchmark (computing);coefficient;coupling (computer programming);electric power conversion;experiment;nonlinear system;online and offline;performance;simulation	Silvio Simani;Saverio Farsoni;Paolo Castaldi	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760570	wind power;adaptive filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;mathematics;actuator	Robotics	67.46441526166721	-9.079897224218376	198617

The main advantage of CAFNN is to obtain analytically its gradient of endpoint products with respect to input. Therefore, an optimal ILC law with direct error feedback is obtained explicitly, and the convergence of tracking error can be analyzed theoretically. It has been proved that the tracking errors may converge to small values. The proposed modeling and control strategy is illustrated on a simulated isothermal semi-batch reactor, and the results show that the endpoint products can be improved gradually from batch to batch.	artificial neural network;batch processing;communication endpoint;control theory;converge;error detection and correction;feedforward neural network;gradient;iteration;iterative method;network model;reactor (software);semiconductor industry;system camera	Zhihua Xiong;Jin Dong;Jie Zhang	2009	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-009-0123-8	batch reactor;feedforward neural network;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial neural network;iterative learning control;batch processing	ML	64.41330239436444	-5.867411053977182	199748
