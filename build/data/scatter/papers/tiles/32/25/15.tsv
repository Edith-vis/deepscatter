Unlike standard networked control architectures, there is no periodic sampling, and the fundamental units of communication contain little numerical information. This paper describes a novel communication channel, modeled after spiking neurons, in which the transmitter integrates an input signal and sends out a spike when the integral reaches a threshold value. The receiver then filters the sequence of spikes to approximately reconstruct the input signal. It is shown that for appropriate choices of channel parameters, stable feedback control over these spiking channels is possible. Furthermore, good tracking performance can be achieved. The data rate of the channel increases linearly with the size of the inputs. Thus, when placed in a feedback loop, small loop gains imply a low data rate.	channel (communications);control system;data rate units;feedback;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);spiking neural network;transmitter;uncompressed video	Andrew G.

A novel version of the minimal control synthesis algorithm, originally developed as a MRAC for smooth systems, is presented. The resulting adaptive algorithm is a switched feedback controller able to cope with uncertain continuous PWA systems. The proof of stability, based on the newly developed passivity theory for hybrid systems, is provided and the effectiveness of the new proposed control strategy is numerically tested.	adaptive algorithm;control theory;hybrid system;numerical analysis;picasa web albums	Mario di Bernardo;Umberto Montanaro;Stefania Santini	2008	2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2008.4739182	control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;network switch;computer science;engineering;control system;control theory;feedback;mathematics;hybrid system	Robotics	66.71879174280248	-2.447126349057624	155823
70eff88ffdd07b30c55c0849d8d8c4b823574d32	on model predictive control of hybrid systems		Model predictive control (MPC) as a powerful and widely applied control method, requires a model of the system in order to predict its behavior. Therefore, when the dynamics of a system is of hybrid nature, formulation of the MPC problem in the hybrid framework is a crucial step towards a successful control implementation. The response of a hybrid system within the prediction horizon is composed of both discrete-valued sequences and continuous-valued timetrajectories. The continuous trajectories can be calculated given the discrete sequences by the means of the recent results on the hybrid maximum principle. It is shown that these calculations reduce to the solution of a system of algebraic equations in the case of affine hybrid systems. Then, an algorithm is proposed for hybrid MPC which calculates the control inputs by iterating on the discrete sequences and calculating the corresponding continuous trajectories. It is shown that the algorithm finds the correct solution in a finite number of steps if the selected cost functional satisfies some conditions. The results are validated during an example control problem.	algebraic equation;algorithm;control theory;html5 in mobile devices;hybrid system;iteration;pontryagin's maximum principle	Babak Tavassoli	2018	CoRR		mathematics;maximum principle;mathematical optimization;control theory;horizon;hybrid system;model predictive control;affine transformation;algebraic equation;finite set	Robotics	61.295605545357596	-0.23201475065569152	156129

We point out that such network effects are likely to render the classical control Lyapunov function (CLF) method unfeasible, mainly due to the monotonic decreasing condition. To solve this problem we make use of a discrete-time equivalent of a control Lyapunov-Razumikhin function (CLRF), which is allowed to be non-monotone. The corresponding stabilizing control law is obtained by solving an optimization problem on-line, in a receding horizon manner, which incorporates the available knowledge about the past state/input trajectory. Furthermore, we provide extra flexibility to the CLRF via a relaxation variable, which is needed to handle hard state/input constraints. We also propose an effective method for dealing with delays larger than the sampling period by means of an on-line Minkowski set addition. This makes it possible to guarantee stability even in the presence of data packet dropouts, under certain assumptions.	common look and feel;control system;effective method;linear programming relaxation;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;network computing system;network packet;online and offline;optimal control;optimization problem;petri net;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);standard-definition television;monotone	Rob H.

The objective of this approach to PEBB control is to create a distributed control system capable of guaranteeing maximum flexibility in the control of a power distribution system. In this control system, controller and controlled device are connected through the network, which affects the measurement and control signals with delays and other effects. This application is therefore subject to the known challenges of networked controllers. The main goal of this work is to outline a design methodology for controllers operating with measurements coming from a network. An approach is proposed here to assess the robustness of the control system in presence of delay and to design the controller for robustness to network delay. This approach is based on uncertainty analysis, assuming that such delay is the main element of uncertainty in the system. The theoretical foundations of this approach are discussed, together with the simulation and implementation of a physical laboratory prototype.	controller (control theory);distributed control system;power electronics;prototype;simulation	Rong Liu;Antonello Monti;Ferdinanda Ponci;Anton H.

Two types of systems are involved. One is time-invariant and the other is time-varying. In addition to stability analysis of the closed-loop systems, the index difference between SD-based LQ control and conventional LQ control is investigated. It is shown that when sample time ΔT is small, so is the index difference. In addition, the upper bounds of the differences are also presented, which areO(ΔT 2) andO(ΔT), respectively.	letter-quality printer;linear canonical transformation;sampling (signal processing);time-invariant system	Lili Yao;Ji-Feng Zhang	2002	Science in China Series F Information Sciences	10.1007/BF02714095	mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds	Robotics	67.20644320408098	1.276711718066196	156878

Guaranteed-cost linear matrix inequalities produce controllers which minimize a shape-independent bound on a quadratic cost; however, the controller has a fixed structure (possibly suboptimal), say a Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC), and does not allow input saturation. By posing the problem as a Model Predictive Control one, the ideas of terminal set, terminal controller and feasible set can be used in order to improve the performance of usual guaranteed-cost controllers for Takagi-Sugeno systems via Quadratic Programming. A Polya-based approach has been introduced in order to (conservatively) transform the invariant set problem into a polytopic one, as well as computing the controller feasibility region. The optimal controller is computed iteratively.	feasible region;fuzzy control system;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear system;optimal control;peripheral dma controller;quadratic programming	Carlos Ariño;Emilio Pérez;Andres Querol;Antonio Sala	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2014.6891633	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.91470240776397	-2.2610834262417936	156909

In these systems, each light fixture has a spectrally tunable light source and a multichannel color sensor, and no communication is required between fixtures. Further, the light transport in the illuminated space is diagonally dominant, i.e., the light sensed by each sensor is primarily from the source in the same fixture. The controller design problems are formulated and solved for two cases of decentralized setpoint tracking and decentralized quadratic optimal control (with tracking error and energy penalty). For the decentralized setpoint tracking problem, a mechanism is proposed to automatically determine the feedback gains using individual sensor measurements in a plug-and-play fashion without the knowledge of the light transport model of the illuminated space. For the decentralized quadratic optimal control, the design problem is approximated with a series of local optimization problems, which are solved in a decentralized manner using individual sensor measurements. A suboptimality bound for the solution of the approximated problem compared with the global optimum is obtained. The performance of the suggested controllers in terms of achievement of a desired setpoint and daylight harvesting for energy saving is validated and evaluated based on typical lighting parameters in a room-scale experimental testbed with light-emitting diode fixtures and color sensors.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;crosstalk;daylight;diagonally dominant matrix;diode;distributed control system;feedback;global optimization;light transport theory;light-on-dark color scheme;mathematical optimization;no-communication theorem;optimal control;optimization problem;plug and play;real life;sensor;setpoint (control system);smart lighting;system identification;test fixture;testbed;vlc media player	Sina Afshari;Sandipan Mishra	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2015.2487880	control engineering;electronic engineering;optimal control;engineering;lighting;control theory;feedback;mathematics;light-emitting diode	Robotics	61.37063241149511	1.1198704943740099	156912

Different from general SDC systems, in singular SDC systems, the relationship between the weights and the control input is expressed by a singular state space model, which increases the difficulty in design of fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control. A non-singular state transformation is made to transform the singular dynamic system into a differential-algebraic system. An adaptive nonlinear observer is designed to estimate the size of the fault occurring in the system. Furthermore, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is applied to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of the observer. Based on the estimated fault information, the active fault tolerant controller is designed to make the post-fault probability density function (PDF) still track the given distribution.

The problem considered here is a generalization of the normalized coprime factor robust stabilization problem. It is shown that the problem admits a simple and intuitive controller implementation parameterized in terms of a state-feedback matrix F and observer gain L. The choice of a state-feedback matrix F induces a metric in which distance between plants is measured. Subsequently, an observer gain L can be obtained to maximize robustness of the controller in this metric via the solution of a Riccati equation. This synthesis method results in a controller of the same order as the nominal plant. It is also shown that non-normalized coprime factorizations are a more suitable tool for obtaining robustly stabilizing controllers for uncertain lightly damped plants than normalized coprime factorizations, which only provide very limited robustness guarantees.	time complexity;time-invariant system	Sönke Engelken;Alexander Lanzon	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426340	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	66.14815651698346	-1.788606186468904	156981

An approximate solution to the optimal control problem is obtained by using an adaptive dynamic programming technique that uses adaptive update laws to estimate the unknown value function. The developed controller overcomes challenges with the approximation of the infinite horizon value function by using an auxiliary function that describes the motion of a virtual target on the desired path. The developed controller guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence of the vehicle to a desired path while maintaining a desired speed profile and UUB convergence of the approximate policy to the optimal policy without requiring persistence of excitation.	approximation algorithm;bellman equation;dynamic programming;gradient descent;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;lyapunov fractal;mobile robot;optimal control;persistence (computer science)	Patrick Walters;Rushikesh Kamalapurkar;Lindsey Andrews;Warren E.

For systems with both input and output weighting filters, guaranteed stability of the reduced-order model is proved as well as existence of solutions, provided that the full-order model is stable. A technique based on cone complementarity linearization is proposed to solve the associated LMI problem. Application to the model of a gantry robot illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. Moreover, a method is proposed to make the reduced order model suitable for practical LPV controller synthesis.	approximation algorithm;cartesian coordinate robot;complementarity theory;input/output;linear matrix inequality;local optimum;scheduling (computing);second-order cone programming;simulation;truncation	Hossam Seddik Abbas;Herbert Werner	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400823	control engineering;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;von neumann stability analysis;observability;controllability;stability;automatic frequency control;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.88456638792009	-2.012008157235134	158159

Like most of industrial power amplifiers, OCCs are typically controlled by classical control methods, which are simple and able to guarantee certain local optimality. However, physical constraints of the system are often neglected in the classical control design, which might lead to unreliable operation. More advanced control methods that can handle constraints are often of high complexity. This paper proposes an explicit control design method for the OCC based on a sequence of quadratic control contractive sets. The proposed controller can be computed by a single linear matrix inequality. It is proven to guarantee stability, locally optimal performance, constraints satisfaction and it has low complexity. Experimental results on a prototype OCC demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	advanced process control;audio power amplifier;contraction mapping;control theory;linear matrix inequality;local optimum;numerical stability;optimal control;optimistic concurrency control;prototype;social inequality;uninterruptible power supply	Tuan T.

Both Gradient and Newton-based methods are considered. Multi-input systems with different time delays in each individual input channel as well as output delays are dealt with. The phase compensation of the dither signals and the inclusion of predictor feedback with a perturbation-based (averaging-based) estimate of the Hessian allow to obtain local exponential convergence results to a small neighborhood of the optimal point, even in the presence of delays. The stability analysis is carried out using backstepping transformation and averaging in infinite dimensions, capturing the infinite-dimensional state due the time delay. In particular, a new backstepping-like transformation is introduced to design the predictor for the Gradient-based extremum seeking scheme with multiple and distinct input delays. The proposed Newton-based extremum seeking approach removes the dependence of the convergence rate on the unknown Hessian of the nonlinear map to be optimized, being user-assignable as in the literature free of delays. A source seeking example illustrates the performance of the proposed delay-compensated extremum seeking schemes.	addendum;algorithm;approximation;broadcast delay;dither;existential quantification;fréchet derivative;gradient;http 404;hessian;kerrison predictor;linear system;map;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;newton;nonlinear system;os-tan;perturbation theory;rate of convergence;real-time clock;singular value decomposition;time complexity	Tiago Roux Oliveira;Miroslav Krstic;Daisuke Tsubakino	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2564958	control engineering;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;convergence;backstepping;control theory;mathematics;predictive modelling	Vision	66.9259362679013	0.052373432721344926	159499

The asynchronous switching is also considered in this paper, where """"asynchronous"""" means that the switching of the controllers to be designed has a lag to the switching of the system models. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is used here to approximate each nonlinear subsystem of the switched nonlinear systems. By using mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) techniques, we obtain stability conditions for the open-loop switched nonlinear systems and stabilization conditions with H ∞ performance for the closed-loop switched nonlinear systems. The desired H ∞ controller can be constructed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the utility and advantage of the proposed method. HighlightsThe previous work studied the H ∞ asynchronous control problem of switched systems mainly focused on the switched linear systems. We use the T-S fuzzy model to study the H ∞ asynchronous control problem of the continuous-time switched nonlinear systems. Furthermore, our work can also reduce to study the H ∞ asynchronous control problem of continuous-time switched linear systems.In order to further reduce the conservativeness resulted from the nonlinearity and the common Lyapunov functions approach, we propose the switching fuzzy Lyapunov functions approach, and this approach can also apply to study other switched nonlinear systems.The mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) switching scheme is used in our study, which can further reduce the conservativeness of results."""	fuzzy control system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Qunxian Zheng;Hongbin Zhang	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.12.037	haplogroup h;real-time computing;control theory;mathematics	SE	67.64575038618035	-0.7555515483224949	160604

We consider the case that the communication delays appear in both position and heading transmissions, which is more realistic in practice. We derive delay-dependent conditions, imposed only on the initial state, to guarantee synchronization of the delayed linear and nonlinear Vicsek models. It is further seen from our simulations that the Vicsek model is indeed sensitive to communication delays in the sense that a large delay can destroy the synchronization behavior.	course (navigation);nonlinear system;simulation;vicsek model;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jiangying Zheng;Jiu-Gang Dong;Lihua Xie	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2017.2648505	simulation;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing	Embedded	67.21773246128465	3.6648586038889754	160782

However, there is a tradeoff between the separability index and the length of the test period. As we have seen, 3 is an increasing function of T. VII. CONCLUSION We have presented a methodology for error-free system identification in the situation where we have two candidate linear models subject to bounded energy noise, and where we have control over the input. The problem of selecting a best input signal over a test period (the minimum proper auxiliary signal design problem) has been solved and a solution given in terms of the solution to a boundary value system. The solution of this boundary value system also enables us to design a very efficient on-line identification scheme, the hyperplane test, that takes into account the fact that the input signal over the test period is known in advance. A related problem which can be solved with the methodology presented here is the shortest test period problem where we fix the separa-bility index and look for the shortest test period for perfect identification. The procedure is similar to the one presented in this paper, except the-iteration part should be replaced with T-iteration. There are a number of possible extensions to the work presented here. One is to allow for additional inputs to the system, i.e., the models would have another input u, in addition to the auxiliary signal v, but this one measured online, just like the output y. This situation has been considered in [9]. Another possible extension is to allow for some nonlinearity. In particular , if the system is not linear in v, the Kalman filter implementation and the hyperplane test still apply. The problem is the optimization over v. An approach using optimization software is discussed in [3].

The optimization framework herein proposed allows the network designer to optimize the coupling elements of a directed network, as well as the dynamics of the nodes in order to maximize the stabilization rate of the network and/or the disturbance rejection against an exogenous input. The cost of implementing a particular network is modeled using polynomial cost functions, which allow for a wide variety of modeling options. In this context, we show that the cost-optimal network design can be efficiently found using geometric programming in polynomial time. We illustrate our results with a practical problem in network epidemiology, namely, the cost-optimal stabilization of the spread of a disease over a time-varying contact network.	cost efficiency;functional requirement;geometric programming;linear system;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;network switch;optimal design;polynomial;posynomial;rejection sampling;time complexity	Masaki Ogura;Victor M.

5d915059e847a5d6ff8c2b697dd89fff4f390ee3	optimal control of sets of solutions to formally guarantee constraints of disturbed linear systems		Optimal control finds an optimal input trajectory which steers an initial state to a desired final state while satisfying given state and input constraints. However, most efficient approaches are restricted to a single initial state. In this paper, we present a new approach, which combines reachability analysis with optimal control. This enables us to solve the optimal control problem for a whole set of initial states by optimizing over the set of all possible solutions. At the same time, we are able to provide formal guarantees for the satisfaction of state and input constraints. Taking the effects of sets of disturbances into account ensures that the resulting controller is robust against them, which is a big advantage over many existing approaches. We show the applicability of our approach with a vehicle-platoon example.	algorithm;computation;control theory;linear system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimization problem;reachability;web application	Bastian Schürmann;Matthias Althoff	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963332	control theory;robustness (computer science);control engineering;control theory;linear system;mathematical optimization;reachability;optimal control;trajectory;mathematics	Robotics	63.10886770520382	-1.5432642225127606	161881

The dynamic uncertainty does not vanish at the origin of the state space and thus is not input-to-state stable (ISS). As a result, the small gain theory based robust control technique alone cannot handle this problem. We manage to integrate both robust control and adaptive control techniques to overcome the difficulty. The problem studied here is motivated from the global robust servomechanism problem for the lower triangular systems subject to an uncertain exosystem.

Within this setting, this paper discusses a Matlab toolbox achieving a self-scheduled LPV controller for an LPV model of the plant, robust in an H∞ sense in the face of uncertainties affecting the system's dynamics, through a Linear Matrix Inequality approach. The resulting algorithm alternatively implements synthesis and analysis steps, until the desired closed-loop performance level has been reached or no improvement between two successive steps arises.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);control system;discretization;iterative method;layer four traceroute;linear matrix inequality;linear time-invariant theory;log management;matlab;mesh analysis;numerical analysis;real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing);social inequality;speech synthesis	Daniele De Vito;Aymeric Kron;Jean de Lafontaine;Marco Lovera	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Aided Control System Design	10.1109/CACSD.2010.5612696	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Embedded	63.036722137608315	-1.923005243313923	162012

Randomly occurring nonlinearities (RONs) are introduced in the system to account for probabili stic nonlinear disturbances typically caused by networked environments and governed by a sequence of random variables o eying the Bernoulli distribution. The imperfect measurement outputs are subject to both data missing and ran domly occurring sensor saturations (ROSSs), which are put forward to characterize the network-induced phenomena such as probabilistic communication failures and limited capacity of the communication devices. The aim of this paper is to design an output-feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable in th e mean square and the prescribed H∞ performance index is satisfied. Sufficient conditions are presented by resorti ng to intensive stochastic analysis and matrix inequality techniques, which not only guarantee the existence of the de sired controllers for all possible time-delays, RONs, missing measurements and ROSSs but also lead to the explicit expressions of such controllers. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to demonstrate the applicabili ty of the proposed control scheme.

The problem, usually referred as mixed H2/H∞, aims at designing a linear state feedback stabilizing controller minimizing a quadratic cost functional subject to a L2-gain disturbance rejection constraint. The formulation deals with time-varying delays and dropouts in both, sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator paths, with the only assumption of known minimum and maximum bounds of the round trip delay, and the maximum number of consecutive dropouts. The solution is based on a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach and is formulated as a Nonlinear Matrix Inequality (NLMI) problem. This problem is cast into more a treatable LMI-based minimization problem, for which a well-known optimization algorithm is provided. Experimental results on a networked controlled direct-drive 2 degree-of-freedom (dof) robot manipulator are provided to verify the performance of the methodology.	algorithm;control system;dropout (neural networks);linear matrix inequality;linear time-invariant theory;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;network packet;nonlinear system;optimal control;rejection sampling;robot;telecommunications network;testbed	Luis Orihuela;Pablo Millán;Guillermo Bejarano;Carlos Vivas;Francisco R.

Based on this parameterization, a numerical optimization method for designing a constant gain feedback matrix which assigns the closed-loop eigenvalues to desired locations such that these eigenvalues have low sensitivity to variations in the open-loop state space model was presented in Owens and O'Reilly [8]. In the present paper, two closely related numerical optimization methods are presented. The methods utilize standard (NAG library) unconstrained optimization routines. The first is for designing a minimum gain state feedback matrix which assigns the closed-loop eigenvalues to desired locations, where the measure of gain taken is the Frobenius norm. The second is for designing a state feedback matrix which results in the closed-loop system state matrix having minimum condition number. These algorithms have been shown to give results which are comparable to other available algorithms of far greater conceptual complexity.	computation;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal control	T.

The identification learning laws are determined through an optimization framework, which is similar in nature to the design of norm optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC). The ILI algorithm has been previously demonstrated to be capable of tracking rapid parameter changes. However, when it is applied to systems with noise, it results in high frequency parameter fluctuation around their true values. This paper suggests a time-varying ILI technique to improve the steady state estimation while maintaining the ILI's ability to track rapid parameter changes.	algorithm;iterative method;mathematical optimization;quantum fluctuation;soft-in soft-out decoder;steady state;system camera;time complexity	Nanjun Liu;Andrew G.

In our approach, vaccines and antidotes are iteratively applied at each time step, while simultaneously ensuring that the total expended cost lies within bounds of available resources. Our problem formulation ensures that the spreading dynamics is stabilized with a limited amount of resources. Amongst others, a merit of the dynamic approach is that resources are allocated to specific nodes or regions in the network that need them most at each time instance, while taking into account the future cost of immunization and treatment actions.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;common look and feel;cost efficiency;discretization;euler;euler–lagrange equation;euler–maruyama method;linear inequality;loss function;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;social inequality	Johannes Köhler;Chinwendu Enyioha;Frank Allgöwer	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431769	management science;computer science;control engineering;dynamic priority scheduling;model predictive control;outbreak;resource allocation	Robotics	61.63268629729001	2.0511233815522716	165606

To cope with such strong nonlinearities and uncertainties, we introduce a rescaling transformation with a gain to be tuned online by a dynamic equation. With the help of the dynamic rescaling technique and the nonsmooth design method proposed recently, we develop a robust output feedback control scheme which leads to a solution to the problem under consideration.

Two decentralized discrete adaptive filtering algorithms are proposed to optimize a wind farm’s total power output without utilizing the wind farm power generation model, and with only limited information sharing among neighbor turbines. Convergence results of the proposed algorithms are presented. The proposed algorithms are further extended to track the time-varying environment. Simulation results show that when turbines in the wind farm employ the proposed decentralized algorithms, the total power output of the turbines quickly converges to or very close to the optimal total power generation. The ability to maximize the power output in time-varying environment is also demonstrated. Finally, the proposed algorithms are demonstrated to be robust in realistic conditions, where large magnitude environmental disturbances are considered.	adaptive filter;algorithm;computation;decentralised system;mathematical optimization;power optimization (eda);rate of convergence;regret (decision theory);requirement;robustness (computer science);server farm;simulation	Shan Zhong;Xiaodong Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2614434	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory	EDA	61.95868241048522	3.1426268743679824	167059

We first formulate the actuation and plant components of the linear system as two subsystems sequentially interconnected with additional feedback, and then convert the robust adaptive control problem as a nonlinear H∞ control problem under imperfect state measurement. We derive the estimators and identifiers of the two subsystems using cost-to-come analysis, and then apply integrator backstepping methodology to obtain the control law. The controller guarantees the boundedness of closed-loop signals with bounded exogenous disturbances, and achieves desired disturbance attenuation level with respect to the unmeasured exogenous disturbance inputs and arbitrary positive or zero disturbance attenuation level with respect to the measured disturbance inputs. In addition, for the measured disturbances that the controller can achieve zero disturbance attenuation level, the asymptotic tracking objective is achieved even if they are only uniformly bounded without being of finite energy.	best, worst and average case;identifier;linear system;nonlinear system;optimal control;recursion;simulation interoperability standards organization	Sheng Zeng	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160744	attenuation;functional analysis;control engineering;mathematical optimization;estimation;uncertainty;adaptive control;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system;statistics;robustness	Robotics	65.59445301274799	-2.5127756272081365	167193

The states of the environment and the actions the agent can perform are represented by real vectors and the system dynamic is given by a linear equation with a stochastic component. The problem is equivalent to the so-called linear quadratic regulator problem studied in the optimal and adaptive control literature. We propose a learning algorithm for that problem and analyze it in a PAC learning framework. Unlike the algorithms in the adaptive control literature, our algorithm actively explores the environment to learn an accurate model of the system faster. We show that the control law produced by our algorithm has, with high probability, a value that is close to that of an optimal policy relative to the magnitude of the initial state of the system. The time taken by the algorithm is polynomial in the dimension n of the state-space and in the dimension T of the action-space when the ratio n/r is a constant.	algorithm;linear equation;linear system;optimal control;polynomial;probably approximately correct learning;reinforcement learning;state space;system dynamics;with high probability	Claude-Nicolas Fiechter	1997		10.1145/267460.267481	computer science;mathematics;linear system	ML	61.84287228098076	-2.224916040243088	167856

The objective of the control is to minimize the two-step quadratic cost function for the problem of tracking the given reference sequence. The presented approach is based on the MIDC (Modified Innovation Dual Controller) derived from an IDC (Innovation Dual Controller) and the TSDSC (Two-stage Dual Suboptimal Control. As a result, a new algorithm, i.e. the two-stage innovation dual control (TSIDC) algorithm is proposed. The standard Kalman filter equations are applied for estimation of the unknown system parameters.

Control of the neural network (plant) is implemented via a communication network. Both quantization and communication network-induced data packet dropouts are considered simultaneously. It is assumed that the plant state signal is quantized by a logarithmic quantizer before transmission, and communication network-induced packet dropouts can be described by a Bernoulli distributed white sequence. A new approach is developed such that controller design can be reduced to the feasibility of linear matrix inequalities, and a desired optimal control gain can be derived in an explicit expression. It is worth pointing out that some new techniques based on a new sector-like expression of quantization errors, and the singular value decomposition of a matrix are developed and employed in the derivation of main results.

It is a natural extension of the traditional optimal control design, under the framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method, to robust optimal control of nonlinear systems with matched uncertainties. In theoretical aspect, by increasing a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system, the robust controller of the matched uncertain system is obtained, which also achieves optimality with a newly well-defined cost function. When regarding the implementation, the data-based integral policy iteration algorithm is used to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the nominal system with completely unknown dynamics information. Then, the actor-critic technique based on neural networks and least squares implementation method are employed to facilitate deriving the optimal control law iteratively, so that the closed-form expression of the robust optimal controller is available. Additionally, two simulation examples with application backgrounds are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the established robust optimal control scheme. In summary, it is important to note that the result developed in this paper broadens the application scope of ADP-based optimal control approach to more general nonlinear systems possessing dynamical uncertainties.	nonlinear system;optimal control	Ding Wang;Chao Li;Derong Liu;Chaoxu Mu	2016	Inf.

We show that by regulating the input-output gradients of policies, strong guarantees of robust stability can be obtained based on a proposed semidefinite programming feasibility problem. The method is able to certify a large set of stabilizing controllers by exploiting problem-specific structures; furthermore, we analyze and establish its (non)conservatism. Empirical evaluations on two decentralized control tasks, namely multi-flight formation and power system frequency regulation, demonstrate that the reinforcement learning agents can have high performance within the stability-certified parameter space, and also exhibit stable learning behaviors in the long run.	artificial neural network;distributed control system;dynamical system;gradient;mission critical;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;reinforcement learning;semidefinite programming;software deployment;theory;world-system	Ming Jin;Javad Lavaei	2018	CoRR		parameter space;mathematical optimization;dynamical systems theory;control theory;decentralised system;semidefinite programming;reinforcement learning;conservatism;mathematics;electric power system;nonlinear system	ML	62.78959436239471	2.9834976057384255	169207

Algorithms for solving such problems stable with respect to informational noises and computational errors are presented. The algorithms oriented to computer realization allow one to simulate a solving process in the """"real time"""" mode. They adaptively take into account inaccurate measurements of phase trajectories and are regularizing in the following sense; the more precise is incoming information, the better is algorithm's output. The algorithms are based on the method of auxiliary positionally-controUed models [1,2,4-7]. The basic elements of the algorithms are represented by stabilization procedures (functioning by the feedback principle) for appropriate Lyapunov functionals. keywords: parabolic inclusions, feedback control, reconstruction"""	algorithm;differential inclusion;dynamical system;feedback;lyapunov fractal;parabolic antenna;real-time computing;robust control;simulation;uncontrolled format string	Vyacheslav Maksimov	2006		10.1007/0-387-33882-9_24	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;control-lyapunov function;lyapunov equation;control theory;lyapunov redesign	ML	67.42245439630256	-2.744328863116684	169286

The system under consideration is subjected to both time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty and unknown time delay in the state, and Markovian jump parameters in all system matrices. We address the problem of robust state feedback control in which both robust stochastic stability and a prescribedH1 performance are required to be achieved irrespective of the uncertainty and time delay. It is shown that the above problem can be solved if a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities has a solution.	broadcast delay;feedback;linear matrix inequality;linear system	Peng Shi;El Kebir Boukas;Ramesh K.

Prior work either stops at the Hamilton-Jacobian-Bellman equations and thus is non-constructive, or converts the optimal control problem into a large scale nonlinear optimization problem and thus is open-loop control design. This paper proposes a generalized policy iteration algorithm to compute the state feedback optimal control policy in a constructive manner, and presents the convergence analysis. Compared with the conventional one for systems in a classic state space form, the generalized policy iteration algorithm for nonlinear descriptor systems differs in the presence of an extra partial differential equation system from which the value function is solved. Necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing solvability of the value function are established. Sufficient solvability conditions for a special case, where the value function is a linear combination of a set of basis functions, are also derived.	algorithm;basis function;bellman equation;iteration;iterative method;jacobian matrix and determinant;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;optimization problem;state space	Yebin Wang;Jing Wu;Chengnian Long	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526569	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;variable structure control;mathematical optimization;optimal control;sliding mode control;automatic control;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	62.660182423821944	-1.5740313281152807	170959

The Hill reference frame is used to describe the dynamics of the game. The goal is to derive feedback control law which forms a saddle point solution to the game. Both spacecraft use continuous-thrust engines. The linear quadratic differential game theory is applied to derive a linear control law. This theory is extended to derive a nonlinear control law using the state-dependent Riccati equation method. A state-dependent coefficient matrix is developed for this purpose. Various scenarios are considered for comparing the performance of the linear and nonlinear laws. In all the scenarios, the efficacy of the nonlinear control law is found to be superior to that of the linear control law with computation cost similar to the linear law.	coefficient;computation;control system;evasion (network security);feedback;game theory;nonlinear system;optimal control;pursuit-evasion;reference frame (video);thrust	Ashish Jagat;Andrew J.

da96429a3ffebafa136c3d73b93a5a4bbc6a8fd4	on achievable behavior of stochastic descriptor systems		A theme widely studied in the control systems and discrete-event systems communities concerns the characterization of the behavior that is achievable by a plant system via interconnection with a controller system. Many results have been found for several classes of discrete, continuous and hybrid systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, current literature does not yet consider stochastic systems. In this paper we aim at filling this gap and address this control problem for the class of Stochastic Descriptor Systems (SDS): given a plant SDS and a desired stochastic behavior, expressed as a SDS, we study conditions under which there exists a SDS controller such that the interconnection between the plant and the controller yields a system having the same stochastic external behavior of the desired SDS. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of stochastic behavioral inclusions. When such conditions are satisfied we show that the so-called canonical controller, obtained as the interconnection of the plant SDS and the desired SDS, provides a solution to the stochastic control problem considered.	arjan brussee;control system;hybrid system;interconnection;memory controller;microsoft outlook for mac;stochastic control;stochastic process	Giordano Pola	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264122	process control;computer science;control theory;control theory;stochastic control;hybrid system;interconnection;stochastic process;linear system;control system	Robotics	67.88133145712797	1.5159426208200908	173584

Both full-order as well as reduced-order observer-based Hz optimal controllers are characterized and parameterized. Also, systematic methods of designing them are presented. An important problem, coined as an H2 optimal control problem with simultaneous pole placement, is formulated and solved. That is, since in general there exist many Hz optimal measurement feedback controllers, utilizing such flexibility and freedom, we can solve the problem of simultaneously placing the closed-loop poles at desirable locations whenever possible while still preserving H2 optimality.

In this paper, a more practical scenario is considered in the setting, i.e., the expectation of packet losses represented as a description of Bernoulli-distributed stochastic process is uncertain. Attention is focused on the design of H∞ controllers such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable and preserves a guaranteed H∞ performance.

By the Internet of Things, the classic physical systems are transformed to the networked cyber physical systems, which are built with a large number of distributed networked sensors. In order to save the precious network resources, a novel distributed event-triggered strategy is proposed. Under this strategy, to generate the localized residual signals, the event-triggered distributed fault detection filters are proposed. By LyapunovKrasovskii functional theory, the distributed fault detection filtering problem can be formulated as stability and an H∞ performance of the residual system. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived such that the resultant residual system is stable while the transmission of the sampled data is reduced. Based on this condition, the codesign method of the fault detection filters and the transmission strategy is proposed. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	code injection;cyber-physical system;fault detection and isolation;functional theories of grammar;internet of things;lyapunov fractal;resultant;sensor node	Yufeng Lin;Biplob Ray;Dennis Jarvis;Jia Wang	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-2741-3_12	distributed computing;computer security;computer network	AI	65.66422282186336	1.8802294639393649	175507

First, an assistant system is introduced for state shifting. Then, in order to overcome the difficulty of the state equation of the stochastic control system being unable to be differentiated because of Brownian motion, the integrator is introduced. Thus, the augmented error system which contains the integrator vector, control input, reference signal, error vector and state of the system is reconstructed. This leads to the tracking problem of the optimal preview control of the linear stochastic control system being transformed into the optimal output tracking problem of the augmented error system. With the method of dynamic programming in the theory of stochastic control, the optimal controller with previewable signals of the augmented error system being equal to the controller of the original system is obtained...	control system;stochastic control	Jiang Wu;Fucheng Liao;Masayoshi Tomizuka	2017	Int.

Firstly, a new event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to determine whether or not the current sampled sensor data should be broadcasted and transmitted to quantizer, which can save the limited communication resource. Secondly, a logarithmic quantizer is used to quantify the sampled data, which can reduce the data transmission rate in the network. Thirdly, considering the influence of the constrained network resource, we investigate the problem of H∞ filter design for a class of event-triggered neural network systems with quantization. By using Lyapunov functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, some delay-dependent stability conditions for the existence of the desired filter are obtained. Furthermore, the explicit expression is given for the designed filter parameters in terms of LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the usefulness of the obtained theoretical results.	artificial neural network;biological neural networks;filter design;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;neural network simulation;numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;social inequality;disease transmission	Jinliang Liu;Jia Tang;Shumin Fei	2016	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2016.06.006	mathematical optimization;haplogroup h;quantization;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability;artificial neural network	ML	66.14018781431884	2.346366425071527	176329

By differentiating both the output error signal and the two sides of the state equation, an augmented error system is constructed, which contains the error signal, the state vector and the derivative of the state vector. Then the performance index function is introduced and the control problem is solved by optimal control theory. Thus the optimal preview control input for the original time-varying system is found. The proposed controller includes the previewable future signal, so the response speed is accelerated.

We propose a family of “transmission-lazy” sensors whose goal is to transmit the measured plant output information as little as possible while preserving closed-loop stability. In particular, we propose two transmission policies, providing conditions on the transmission parameters. These guarantee global asymptotic stability when the plant state is available or when an estimate of the state is available (provided by a classical continuous linear observer). Moreover, under a specific condition, they guarantee global exponential stability.	asynchronous i/o;bibo stability;centralized computing;control system;feedback;interconnection;lazy evaluation;propagation constant;sensor;time complexity;transmission (bittorrent client)	Fulvio Forni;Sergio Galeani;Dragan Nesic;Luca Zaccarian	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2013.11.001	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;control theory;mathematics;hybrid system	ML	65.85455487350188	1.49248274841798	177413

The reference preview need is reduced to only two steps irrespective of the type of reference signal making real-time implementation an achievable goal. A rigorous proof of optimality is provided for a set of infinite horizon reference commands which includes the linear combination of constant and exponentially bounded signals. Dissipativity, finite gain and l1 performance of the controlled system are also evaluated. The behaviour of the proposed LQ tracker and its previously published sub-optimal version with one-step preview is demonstrated in conjunction with an application example. Their performances are compared to those of alternative solutions including set point control and model predictive control. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed rigorous solution of the infinite horizon tracking problem is real-time realizable and performs advantageously compared to other solutions.

By means of simulations, the possible improvement of performance and reduction of constraint violation, introduced by this extension, are investigated. Moreover, uncommon issues in the adaptive controller design due to the two time-scales are considered and handled in this paper. The estimated parameters are selected based on their uncertainty and performance sensitivity. Using a recently developed very efficient algorithm, the selected parameters are checked for identifiability first. Finally the possibility of real-time implementation of the adaptive two time-scale receding horizon optimal controller is investigated.	optimal control	Dan Xu;Shangfeng Du;L.

The structure of the optimal cost functional is defined as an extension of its definition from lumped parameter systems (LPS) but for the infinite dimensional state space. Subsequently, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is formulated in the infinite dimensional domain without using any model reduction. Since solving the HJB equation for the exact optimal value functional is burdensome, a radial basis function network (RBF) is subsequently proposed to achieve a computationally feasible solution online and in a forward-in time manner. The optimal value functional is tuned by using conventional adaptive laws such that the HJB equation error is minimized and accordingly the optimal control policy is derived. Ultimate boundedness (UB) of the closed-loop system is verified by using the Lyapunov theory. The performance of proposed controller is successfully verified on an unstable diffusion reaction process.	approximation;bellman equation;control theory;dynamic programming;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;jacobi method;lightweight portable security;linear algebra;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;optimization problem;parabolic antenna;pictbridge;radial (radio);radial basis function network;state space;undefined behavior	Behzad Talaei;Sarangapani Jagannathan;John Singler	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2015.7320691	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	62.29347069077459	-2.704593352696919	178816

A general approach is used, in which the connection between terminal weights and bounds on the nal predicted state is revealed and exploited. This analysis shows that knowledge of upper and lower bounds for the nite horizon costs are suucient to determine the stability of a receding horizon controller for an arbitrary terminal weight. First, simple upper and lower bounds are derived for stable constrained systems, providing a constraint independent test for global stability. A more sophisticated approach is then considered, which uses linear matrix inequalities to achieve much tighter upper bounds. This technique is valid for unstable systems as well, representing the rst easily computable conditions for guaranteed stability of a class of constrained unstable systems without applying end constraints. Examples are presented demonstrating the approach as a powerful new tool.	computable function;control theory;linear matrix inequality;linear system	James A. Primbs;Vesna Nevistic	2000	IEEE Trans.

The dynamics of the harvester include a constant time-delay and a retardation (distributed delay) term. The jump component accounts for abrupt changes in the excitation signal. The optimal control is characterized based on the dynamic programming. In the delay-free and retardation term-free cases, constructing the optimal control reduces to solving a system of ordinary differential equations backward-in-time. Thus the inclusion of the jump terms in the model does not significantly complicate the optimal control and optimal cost construction. With delay and/or retardation terms present, it is demonstrated that a set of appropriately formulated Partial Differential Equations need to be solved. The approach enables the quantification of limits on achievable performance by the energy harvester in terms of amounts of energy that can be extracted when jump-diffusion input excitation is present. A computational example for a delay free case is reported.	dynamic programming;norm (social);optimal control;time complexity	Ilya V. Kolmanovsky;Tatiana L.

Previous work has focused on either characterizing special structures that result into convex formulations, or employing certain techniques to allow convex relaxations of the original problem. In this paper, by exploiting the underlying sparsity properties of the problem, and using chordal decomposition, we propose a scalable algorithm to obtain structured feedback gains to stabilize a large-scale system. We first extend the chordal decomposition theorem for positive semidefinite matrices to the case of matrices with block-chordal sparsity. Then, a block-diagonal Lyapunov matrix assumption is used to convert the design of structured feedback gains into a convex problem, which inherits the sparsity pattern of the original problem. Combining these two results, we propose a sequential design method to obtain structured feedback gains clique-by-clique over a clique tree of the block-chordal matrix, which only needs local information and helps ensure privacy of model data. Several illustrative examples demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed sequential design method.	algorithm;convex function;convex optimization;lyapunov fractal;scalability;semidefinite programming;sparse matrix;tree decomposition	Yang Zheng;Richard P.

We adopt a parallel additive white noise (AWN) model for the MIMO communication channel, and consider as our performance measure the mean square error for a system's output to track a random reference signal with finite power. Of particular interest in our study is the joint design of the controller and the channel to mitigate the requirement on feedback stabilization and to better the tracking performance. To this effect we consider scaled AWN channels, with positive diagonal scaling matrices interpreted as static coders and decoders. By casting the problem as a constrained optimal H2 control problem and employing duality principles, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the system to be mean-square stabilizable and analytical characterizations for the best achievable performance under channel input power constraint. While fundamental limits are known to exist, it is seen that an appropriate channel scaling can be employed to exploit the channel power effectively so as to fundamentally improve a system's stabilizability and tracking performance.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);image scaling;language technologies institute;mimo;mean squared error;programmer;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Jie Chen;Yiqian Li;Ertem Tuncel;Weizhou Su	2015	2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244430	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	63.56243899404066	1.685791791087292	181181

Studying control-related problems in PBNs may provide new insights into the intrinsic control in biological systems and enable us to develop strategies for manipulating complex biological systems using exogenous inputs. This paper investigates the problem of state feedback stabilization for PBNs. Based on the algebraic representation of logic functions, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the existence of a globally stabilizing state feedback controller, and a control design method is proposed when the presented condition holds. It is shown that the controller designed via the proposed procedure can simultaneously stabilize a collection of PBNs that are composed of the same constituent BNs.	boolean network	Rui Li;Meng Meng Yang;Tianguang Chu	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2014.02.034	control engineering;boolean algebra;boolean circuit;discrete mathematics;boolean network;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.30850866169912	3.290391473841656	181452

The considered NCS model is subject to the sources of uncertainty in the system parameters. The sensor signals are modelled by sequences of a Bernoulli distributed white sequence and the packet dropouts may occur randomly during transmission. The main objective is to design a suitable reliable dissipative fllter such that, for all network-induced imperfections, a resulting error system is robustly stochastically stable and strictly (Q, S, R) dissipative. The results are obtained for known as well as unknown sensor failure rates, so the results are more general one because it can guarantee the dissipativity of system whether or not the sensor encounter failures. The sufflcient conditions for existence of fllters are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and the corresponding fllter parameters can be obtained by solution to a set of LMIs, which can be easily solved by using some standard numerical packages. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed fllter design.	control system	K. Mathiyalagan;Ju H.

In input reconstruction problems, the outputs of a dynamical system are known, and the objective is to reconstruct the inputs to the system that caused the measured outputs. Command following problems can be viewed from a similar perspective. The desired outputs of the system are known and the control inputs that would yield those desired outputs have to be determined. In that sense, by implicitly assuming that a control input exists such that the output of the system will be equal to the desired output, one can use input reconstruction to determine the corresponding control inputs by pretending that the the desired outputs are the actual outputs of the system. With this end in view we explore a few control schemes based on the filter-based approach to input reconstruction and demonstrate the efficacy of these methods with illustrative numerical examples.	dynamical system;linear system;numerical analysis;reconstruction conjecture;reconstructor	Roshan A.

Such channel consists of multiple independent SISO AWN channels subject to independent input power constraints. We derive dynamic output feedback stabilization conditions subject to such constraints, for minimum phase plants that have relative degree one. Consequently, these conditions are also valid for general plants provided that state feedback is employed. Our results show that necessary and sufficient condition for stabilization can be determined by studying the feasibility of a constrained algebraic Riccati equation. These results are also extended to stabilization problems subject to channel capacity constraints.	additive white gaussian noise;algebraic riccati equation;block cipher mode of operation;channel capacity;constraint (mathematics);feedback;linear time-invariant theory;mimo;mean squared error;minimum phase;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;soft-in soft-out decoder;telecommunications link;time complexity;time-invariant system;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Francisco J.

dbcc4726da998f6f773a4077f1735bc83f736105	model-free cooperative control for multi-agent systems using the approximate dynamic programming approach		In this paper, the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) technique is used to resolve the cooperative control problem for the completely model-free linear multi-agent systems in both continuous-time and discrete-time cases. To ensure the consensus achieved at a specified consensus speed, the modified LQR design technique is used. The sufficient condition for the consensus is derived. However, in actual applications, the precise models of the multi-agent systems cannot be easily obtained, and the nominal mathematical models are even unavailable. To overcome this difficulty, ADP-based model-free algorithms are developed to obtain the distributed protocols based on the proposed consensus design method. Moreover, the specified consensus speed can be guaranteed. Compared with the existing work, the superiority of the developed methods ensures that all the following agents synchronize to the leader with the error converging to zero instead of a bounded residual error. Two numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the developed approaches.	approximation algorithm;consensus dynamics;dynamic programming;mathematical model;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;usb on-the-go	Yanhua Qu;Anna Wang;Jinglu Liu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849754	residual;mathematical optimization;distributed computing;synchronization;dynamic programming;mathematical model;multi-agent system;bounded function;computer science;convergence (routing)	Robotics	63.461931242564596	1.8599489257044768	186962

This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem based on an l∞ observer for a class of positive discrete-time Markovian jump systems (MJSs). The system under consideration consists of time-varying delay and uncertain transition probabilities, where the transition probability matrix is described by a polytope set. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented in linear programming (LP) form for the resulting error dynamic system to be stochastically stable and stochastically stable with an l∞-gain performance, respectively. Furthermore, an l∞ observer design scheme is presented to solve the state estimation problem such that the resulting error dynamic system is stochastically stable and achieves a prescribed l∞-gain performance. All the proposed conditions are solvable in terms of LP with additional parameters. Finally, some examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the developed technique.	markov chain	Shuwei Li;Zhengrong Xiang;Hai Lin;Hamid Reza Karimi	2016	Inf.

585b75ed038bf2c64cdd1e120644a8651a193e0b	weak control for human-in-the-loop systems		In this letter, we propose a control framework for human-in-the-loop systems, in which many human decision makers are involved in the feedback loop composed of a plant and a controller. The novelty of the framework is that the decision makers are weakly controlled; in other words, they receive a set of admissible control actions from the controller and choose one of them in accordance with their private preferences. For example, the decision makers can decide their actions to minimize their own costs or by simply relying on their experience and intuition. A class of controllers which output set-valued signals is proposed, and it is shown that the overall control system is stable independently of the decisions made by the humans. Finally, a learning algorithm is applied to the controller that updates the controller parameters to reduce the achievable minimal costs for the decision makers. Effective use of the algorithm is demonstrated in a numerical experiment.	algorithm;control system;embedded system;feedback;numerical analysis	Masaki Inoue;Vijay Gupta	2018	CoRR		novelty;control theory;control theory;robust control;mathematics;human-in-the-loop;intuition;control system;feedback loop	Robotics	63.77380717436777	2.1913008767343216	187135

That is to say, the communication channels between the controller and the actuators and between the sensors and the controller are unreliable. This is of growing importance as networked control systems and use of wireless communication in control are becoming increasingly common. A proposed approach is to use tree codes to turn lossy channels into ones with a random delay. The problem of how to optimize LQG control in this case is examined, and it is found that to optimize LQG control previous control signals must also be used. Only the situation where communication between the components is done with acknowledgments is examined. An optimal solution is derived for finite horizon discrete hold-input LQG control for this case. The solution is compared with standard LQG control in simulations, which demonstrate that a significant improvement in the cost can be achieved when the probability of delay is high.	code;control system;lossy compression;sensor;simulation	Fredrik Bengtsson;Babak Hassibi;Torsten Wik	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798406	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;optimal projection equations;linear-quadratic regulator;real-time computing;engineering;sensor;control theory;linear system;wireless;actuator	Robotics	65.87998278761336	1.70862142946077	188235

Given the structure of an autonomous linear dynamical system, the goal is to design the structure of the input matrix (commonly denoted by B) such that the system is structurally controllable with the restriction that each input be dedicated, i.e., it can only control directly a single state variable. We provide a methodology to determine the minimum number of dedicated inputs required to ensure structural controllability, and characterize all (when not unique) possible configurations of the minimal input matrix B. Furthermore, we show that the proposed solution incurs polynomial complexity in the number of state variables. By duality, the solution methodology may be readily extended to the structural design of the corresponding minimal output matrix (commonly denoted by C) that ensures structural observability.	autonomous robot;dynamical system;linear time-invariant theory;time complexity;time-invariant system	Sergio Daniel Pequito;Soummya Kar;Antonio Pedro Aguiar	2013	2013 American Control Conference		control engineering;mathematical optimization;observability;controllability;optimal control;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system;state-transition matrix;computational complexity theory;actuator	Robotics	63.67636042374153	0.959907364493876	188377

The primary disadvantages of current design techniques of sampled-data control are their inabilities to deal effectively with time-delay and the model uncertainty. In this paper, we generalized the analysis methodology of time-delay systems to that of the hybrid systems with time-delay and uncertainty, which developed a design procedure of sampled-data control for time-delay systems. Asymptotic stability of the time-delay hybrid systems was developed. The time-delay dependent robust sampled-data control for the time-varying delay of an uncertain linear system was then discussed. The results were described as linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved using newly released LMITool.		Li-Sheng Hu;Yong-Yan Cao;Chuwang Cheng;Hui-He Shao	2002	J.

Embedding the Markov state into an extended Markov chain, we transform the given system with time-randomized observations to another one having the enlarged Markov state space but with so-called cluster observations of Markov states. Based on this transformation we propose linear matrix inequalities for designing stabilizing state-feedback gains for the original Markov jump linear systems. The proposed method can treat both periodic observations and many of renewaltype observations in a unified manner, which are studied in the literature using different approaches.

Sufficient conditions for the stability, H2 and induced l2-norm performance of a given LPV system are given through a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) and exploited for design. Extension to the case of uncertain scheduling parameter value is considered as well. Controller parameters appear directly as decision variables in the convex optimisation program, which enables preserving a desired controller structure in addition to the low order. Efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated on a simulation example, with an iterative convex optimisation scheme used for the improvement of the control system performance.	block cipher mode of operation;control system;convex optimization;decision theory;h2 database engine;iteration;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);simulation	Zlatko Emedi;Alireza Karimi	2016	Int.

In sharp contrast to the conventional design methods, the scheduling parameters are supposed to be inexactly measured. The LPV systems are supposed to have parametrically affine state-space matrices with some mild constraints, and the controllers to be designed are also supposed to have parametrically affine state-space matrices. Using parameter-independent Lyapunov functions, we give sufficient conditions for designing GS H2 and GS H∞ output-feedback controllers, which are robust against the uncertainties in the measured scheduling parameters, in terms of parametrically affine Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) with single line search parameters. Our methods recover the design methods of conventional GS output-feedback controllers with an appropriate choice for the line search parameters. We also give an extension of our methods to robust controller design for LPV systems. A simple numerical example is included to illustrate our results.	control theory;existential quantification;line search;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;robust control;roland gs;scheduling (computing);state space	Masayuki Sato	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5718168	control engineering;mathematical optimization;design methods;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.5871594974938	-2.1125308445188242	191248

This new modeling approach is robust control oriented which allows factorization of the quantized fading channels (QFC) into a disturbance path, involving both quantization and fading impacts, and a nominal dedicated path. A quasi-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (qSNR) is introduced to characterize the QFC, mimicking the traditional characterization of a disturbance uncertainty set in the norm bound. Through an example, it is shown that this new modeling approach turns the stabilizing control problem for networked systems with QFC into a normal small-gain design issue and offers a nice physical interpretation of the communication channel when its impact is considered on the performance of networked control systems. It is also shown that this new channel model is comprehensive, providing an unified expression of QFCs with either relative-error or multiplicative-error quantization.	approximation error;channel (communications);control system;mimo;noise (electronics);quantization (signal processing);robust control;signal-to-noise ratio	Xiang Chen;Guoxiang Gu;Li Qiu;Yu Feng	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760720	robust control;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;mathematics;channel state information;fading	Robotics	63.60396184728632	1.6655744351613304	191344

The problem is investigated in discrete-time state space using Lyapunov's stability theory and the linear inequality matrix technique. A new discrete-time modeling approach is developed to describe a networked control system (NCS) with parameter uncertainties and nonideal network QoS. It integrates a network-induced delay, packet dropout, and other network behaviors into a unified framework. With this modeling, an improved stability condition, which is dependent on the lower and upper bounds of the equivalent network-induced delay, is established for the NCS with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. It is further extended for the output feedback stabilization of the NCS with nonideal QoS. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the main results of the theoretical development.	block cipher mode of operation;control system;dropout (neural networks);linear inequality;lyapunov fractal;network computing system;network packet;quality of service;social inequality;state space;unified framework	Chen Peng;Yu-Chu Tian;Dong Yue	2011	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans	10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2055155	real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;networked control system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.08898016342762	1.1172700701321894	191468

The master system and the slave system, considered here, are assumed to be with non-identical structure, external dynamical disturbances, uncertain models and distinct fractional-orders. The adaptive fuzzy systems are used for estimating some unknown nonlinear functions. A Lyapunov approach is adopted for deriving the parameter adaptation laws and proving the stability of the closed-loop system. Under some mild assumptions, the proposed controller can guarantee all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded and the underlying synchronization errors asymptotically converge towards a small of neighborhood of the origin. Finally, some numerical experiment results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization scheme.	chaos theory	Abdesselem Boulkroune;Amel Bouzeriba;Toufik Bouden	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.08.003	discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics;synchronization of chaos	Robotics	66.2758582925393	3.6748646351680767	191838

In particular, we compensate the lack of measurements using an estimator approximately reconstructing the current state. Interestingly, under certain checkable conditions, we establish that a controller that semiglobally practically integral input-to-(integral-)state stabilizes an approximate discrete-time model of a single-rate nonlinear sampled-data system, also stabilizes the exact discrete-time model of the nonlinear sampled-data system in the same sense implemented in a dual-rate setting.

And the results are established on the grounds of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) formulation. Basically, this work is concerned with: (1) developing a framework for testing the asymptotic stability of such systems; and (2) designing a state feedback control system to fulfill the disturbance attenuation objective. To accomplish it, an asymptotic stability condition, which is an extension of the one for the 2-D delayless discrete systems, is first pursued by means of the Lyapunov second method. Next, taken this into account, a condition for the existence of a memory controller that provides a feedback control system with the disturbance attenuation characteristic is established.	control theory	Guido Izuta	2007	Int.

We focus on increasing-gain observers, which have been recently proposed as generalization of high-gain observers because of a time-varying gain that is let to be small in the first time instants, increases over time up to a maximum. As a novelty with respect to the literature on high-gain observer, the proof of stability is obtained by using a Lyapunov functional, thus allowing to accomplish the observer design with a reduced peaking. As a new contribution, we relax the system assumptions under which the global asymptotic stability of the estimation error is proved. The stability of the estimation error for the proposed observer is ensured by assuming a Lipschitz upper bound to which an exponentially decreasing term is added.	lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Angelo Alessandri;Anna Rossi	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760494	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability	Robotics	67.80345079996256	-2.027959334388395	192234

The system under consideration not only contains Ito-type stochastic disturbances and time-varying delays, but also involves uncertainties both in the system matrices and in the mode transition rate matrix. Our aim is to design an H∞ filter such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and time-delays, the filtering error system can be guaranteed to be robustly stochastically stable, and achieve a prescribed H∞ disturbance rejection attenuation level. By constructing a proper stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing the free-weighting matrix technique, sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired filters are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily solved by standard numerical software. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the utility of the developed approaches.	markov chain;stochastic process	Xiuming Yao;Ligang Wu;Wei Xing Zheng;Changhong Wang	2011	Int. J.

c8bdc67a78dc2ca5d19b6d1155f33e0e7195f0b4	an improved approach to controller design of positive systems using controller gain decomposition		This paper aims to propose an improved controller design approach for positive systems in both continuous-time and discrete-time contexts. First, by decomposing the controller gain matrix into components, compact conditions that is simple and easy to be computed for guaranteeing the positivity and stability of positive systems is formulated. Based on the obtained conditions, new stabilization results and subsequent controller design are formulated with improvements in both the feasibility of conditions and the generality of the controller. All conditions are solvable in terms of linear programming. Compared with existing approaches in the literature, the new design approach constructs a controller with simpler forms and less restrictions. Meanwhile, the efficiency and advantage of the present approach are verified by application to the typically studied problems in the literature. Some discussions on the proposed approach are provided to show its potential applications on positive systems. Finally, three comparison examples are given to verify the merits of the theoretical findings.	model–view–controller;positive systems	Junfeng Zhang;Xudong Zhao;Ridong Zhang	2017	J.

The paper examines a singular perturbation model of tracking two targets, one slow and a fast one which is assumed periodic. The plant is linear and the cost is quadratic. A limit problem is displayed. It corresponds to the limit behavior of the perturbed system when the small parameter tends to zero. This limit is not of reduced order, as the fast target is periodic. Rather, an infinite-horizon optimal averaging is performed on the fast scale, and serves as an input to slowscale optimization. This limit design is used to approximate the optimal solution of the singularly perturbed system. Bounds for the rates of the approximation are given. The optimal limit design is computed in a feedback form in the general case, and for illustrative concrete examples.	approximation algorithm;feedback;mathematical optimization;quadratic function	Zvi Artstein;Vladimir Gaitsgory	1997	MCSS	10.1007/BF01219773	control engineering;singular perturbation;mathematical optimization;optimal control;limit;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	61.73406887101466	-0.8008797658011394	195144

We assume that the subsystems, initially uncoupled, must be interconnected through controllers to be designed with a constraint on the data rate obtained by every subsystem from all other subsystems. As a measure for the smallest data rate arriving at a fixed subsystem, above which the overall system is able to achieve the control goal, we introduce the notion of subsystem invariance entropy. Moreover, we associate with a network of n subsystems, a closed convex subset of Rn encompassing all possible combinations of data rates within the network that guarantee the existence of corresponding feedback strategies for making a given set invariant. The extremal points of this convex set can be regarded as Pareto-optimal data rates for the control problem, expressing a tradeoff between the data rates required by different systems. For linear systems and for synchronization of chaos, these quantities are characterized.	applicative programming language;convex set;data rate units;entropy (information theory);initial condition;linear system;nonlinear system;pareto efficiency;stepping level;surrogate data;synchronization of chaos	Christoph Kawan;Jean-Charles Delvenne	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems	10.1109/TCNS.2015.2440551	control engineering;mathematical optimization;networked control system;control theory;mathematics	Theory	66.85198284585111	3.7341536649149827	195517
a7155cf47290e8531ab7d865d986431097b600c7	online feedback control for input-saturated robotic systems on lie groups		In this paper, we propose an approach to designing online feedback controllers for input-saturated robotic systems evolving on Lie groups by extending the recently developed Sequential Action Control (SAC). In contrast to existing feedback controllers, our approach poses the nonconvex constrained nonlinear optimization problem as the tracking of a desired negative mode insertion gradient on the configuration space of a Lie group. This results in a closed-form feedback control law even with input saturation and thus is well suited for online application. In extending SAC to Lie groups, the associated mode insertion gradient is derived and the switching time optimization on Lie groups is studied. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach in the 2D kinematic car on SE(2) and the 3D quadrotor on SE(3). We also implement iLQG on a quadrator model and compare to SAC, demonstrating that SAC is both faster to compute and has a larger basin of attraction.

By using the error distribution in the predictions of the finite horizon optimal control problem, we can incorporate stochastic information in order to improve the expected performance while being able to guarantee strict feasibility. For this new framework, we can provide bounds on the asymptotic average performance of the closed-loop system. Moreover, a constructive approach is presented in order to find an appropriate terminal cost leading to a slight degradation of the bound on the guaranteed average performance.		Florian A.

The architecture was presented recently [1] and it was shown to achieve constant inter-vehicle spacings (with no transient) for almost every vehicle pair when there are no disturbances at the followers. We expand the analysis of this interconnection by obtaining a condition on the design parameters that ensures the string stability of the interconnection to disturbances at any follower.

The system is written as a switched system. A state feedback is then computed for each mode using predictive control. It is shown that a nonlinear optimization problem can be formulated in order to obtain a control law which gives the best approximation of the state feedback control previously computed for each mode. This formulation ensures stability since stabilization conditions are also included through a common Lyapunov function. The optimization problem is then transformed to a problem with Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMI) constraints whose solution can be easily computed. Several examples show the feasibility and the efficiency of the approach.	approximation;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;brain–computer interface;broadcast delay;closed-loop transfer function;feedback;linear system;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical method;optimal control;optimization problem;state space	Andres Ladino;Diego Patino	2013	2013 American Control Conference		control engineering;mathematical optimization;control-lyapunov function;stability;nonlinear programming;control theory;mathematics;linear system;model predictive control;approximation theory	Robotics	63.358477689580816	-1.2239784029224046	197075

RONs are introduced to model a class of sector-like nonlinearities that occur in a probabilistic way according to a two-dimensional discrete random variables joint distribution. The failures of sensors are quantified by a variable varying in a given interval. The time-varying delay is unknown with given lower and upper bounds. Firstly, the filtering errr dynamic system is constructed based on an H∞ filter, sufficient criteria are provided to guarantee that the resulting filtering error system is stochastic finite-time boundedness and stochastic finite-time H∞ filtering in both normal and fault cases. The gain matrices of the controller and filter are achieved by solving a feasibility problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities with a fixed parameter, respectively. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

e83e043784ecd2e47258c6daa37ef952081a939f	h2 and h∞ mode-independent state-feedback control of generalized bernoulli jump systems with uncertain probabilities		Many practical problems arising in networked control systems can be suitably modeled by linear stochastic systems described in terms of discrete-time generalized Bernoulli models, that are a particular case of the so called Markov jump linear systems. Motivated by real world applications where the transition probability matrix is uncertain, this paper proposes a general framework to deal with the problem of control design for Bernoulli systems, providing synthesis conditions for $mathscr{H}_{2}$ and $mathscr{H}_{infty}$ state-feedback controllers that are sufficient in the uncertain case and also necessary (optimal) for precisely known models. The conditions can be solved in terms of LMI relaxations of increasing accuracy, allowing the user to tradeoff precision and computational cost in the search for better solutions. The networked control of a mechanical plant is presented to illustrate the applicability of the method.	bernoulli polynomials;bernoulli scheme;feedback	Cecília F. Morais;Jonathan M.

It is shown that the technique of control contraction metrics (CCMs) can be extended to this problem by utilizing separable metric structures, resulting in controllers that only depend on information from local sensors and communications from immediate neighbours. The conditions given are pointwise linear matrix inequalities, and are necessary and sufficient for linear positive systems and certain monotone nonlinear systems. Distributed synthesis methods for systems on chordal graphs are also proposed based on SDP decompositions. The results are illustrated on a problem of vehicle platooning with heterogeneous vehicles, and a network of nonlinear dynamic systems with over 1000 states that is not feedback linearizable and has an uncontrollable linearization.	computation;distributed control system;dynamical system;emoticon;linear matrix inequality;linearizability;nonlinear system;platoon (automobile);positive systems;scalability;semidefinite programming;sensor;simulation;monotone	Humberto Stein Shiromoto;Max Revay;Ian R.

The problem is to optimally locate the controlled dynamic elements within the R2R machine so as to minimize the effect of disturbances propagated by the transported web. Typical disturbances on R2R machines include misalignment and out-of-roundness of rollers which cause web wrinkles and registration errors if unattenuated. The central contribution of this paper is to pose the combinatorial problem of determining the optimal configuration for a R2R machine as a Mixed-Integer Semi-Definite Program (MISDP) and provide an algorithm to efficiently compute feasible configurations and bounds on their sub-optimality. The proposed algorithm is based on tools such as McCormick relaxations, outer-approximation via eigenvalue cuts, and bound tightening procedures. We provide numerical results for representative R2R systems to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;approximation;combinatorial optimization;dynamical system;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;software propagation;systems theory	Harsha Nagarajan;Prabhakar R.

Two features of the proposed observer are worth to be pointed out. The first one consists in the simplicity of its calibration, while the second one lies in its comprehensive convergence analysis. More specifically, it is shown that the observation error lies in a ball centered at the origin and whose radius is proportional to the bounds of the uncertainties and the sampling partition diameter. In the free uncertainties case, the exponential convergence to zero of the observation error is established under a well-defined condition on the maximum value of the sampling partition diameter. The effectiveness of the proposed observer is emphasized throughout simulation results involving the estimation of the reaction rate in a typical bioreactor.	emoticon;include directive;nonlinear system;online and offline;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time complexity;weak measurement	Mondher Farza;Ibtissem Bouraoui;Tomas Menard;Ridha Ben Abdennour;M.
