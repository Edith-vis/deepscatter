The active-RC configuration uses single amplifier biquads (SABs) to save power and has resistor and capacitor arrays to provide variable gain and bandwidth trimming. The biquads are implemented using three-stage opamps and a hybrid /spl pi/-to-tee transformation network for the resistor arrays, so that higher linearity than conventional Sallen-Key circuits may be obtained. The filter achieves a measured THD of -72 dB at 1 MHz.	baseband;cmos;decibel;low-pass filter;operational amplifier;total harmonic distortion;variable-gain amplifier	Sachin Ranganathan;Terri S.

Based on the switched-opamp technique, an inverse-flip-around architecture which maximizes the feedback factor is employed in the proposed S/H. A skew-insensitive double-sampling mechanism is presented to increase the throughput by a factor of two while eliminating the timing mismatch associated with double-sampling circuits. Furthermore, a dual-input dual-output opamp is proposed to incorporate double-sampling into the switched-opamp based S/H. This opamp also removes the memory effect in double-sampling circuitry and features fast turn-on time to improve the speed performance in switched-opamp circuits. Simulation results using a 0.13-μm CMOS process model demonstrates the proposed S/H circuit has a total-harmonic-distortion of −67.3 dB up to 250 MSample/s and a 0.8VPP input range at 0.8 V supply. The power consumption is 3.5 mW and the figure-of-merit is only 7.4 fJ/step. key words: switched-opamp, low-voltage, high-speed, sample-and-hold, double-sampling	algorithmic inference;cmos;electronic circuit;memory effect;operational amplifier;performance per watt;process modeling;sample and hold;sampling (signal processing);simulation;throughput;total harmonic distortion	Hsin-Hung Ou;Bin-Da Liu;Soon-Jyh Chang	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e91-c.9.1480	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;sample and hold;total harmonic distortion	EDA	63.84650942892885	47.205112299286135	180889

As Nelder-Mead is intended for unconstrained optimization problems, we present an implementation of the algorithm which is suitable for bounded and discretized RFIC calibration problems. We apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of spurious tone reduction via VCO control line ripple minimization for a PLL operating at a frequency of 12 GHz. For this nonconvex calibration test case, we show that a gradient descent-based algorithm has difficulty in reducing the VCO control line ripple, while the proposed algorithm reduces the relative power of the first harmonic reference spurs by at least 10 dBc and effectively enables design complexity reduction in the supporting analog calibration circuitry.	discretization;electronic circuit;global optimization;gradient descent;local optimum;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;nelder–mead method;optimization problem;phase-locked loop;rfic;radio frequency;reduction (complexity);ripple effect;search algorithm;spurious tone;test case;voltage-controlled oscillator	Eric J.

In this paper, jitter phenomena caused by radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise are considered. EMI noise is mainly present in the test head of an ATE as result of the activity of the dc-dc converters. An analysis has been pursued to establish the areas of the test-head board that are most sensitive to EMI noise. The most sensitive part of the test-head board has been found to occur in the loop filter of the phase-locked loop (PLL) that is used to obtain a high-frequency clock for the timing generator (TG). Different H-fields are then externally applied to the loop filter to verify the behavior of the output signal in terms of rms jitter. A frequency-domain methodology has been employed for the rms-jitter measurements. The rms-jitter variation for the radiated EMI magnitude and frequency has been characterized. Also, the orientation of the external H-field source has been investigated with respect to the target board and its effects on the measured rms jitter. For measuring the jitter, an interface circuitry has been designed on an adapter board to circumvent ground noise and connectivity problems arising from the test-head environment.	arnold tongue;built-in test equipment;emi;electronic circuit;filter bank;interference (communication);phase-locked loop;test case	Luca Schiano;Mariam Momenzadeh;Fengming Zhang;Young-Jun Lee;Thomas Kane;Solomon Max;Philip Perkins;Yong-Bin Kim;Fabrizio Lombardi;Fred J.

The compensation network entails only a single Miller capacitor, thus avoiding the use of additional transistor and current consumption. Theoretical analysis is reported and an implementation in a 0.35-μm technology is presented and simulated. A 1.46-MHz gain-bandwidth product is achieved with a 10-nF load, while consuming only 8.54 μW from 1.4-V supply. As compared to other previously reported solutions, the amplifier shows a remarkable increase in small-signal and large-signal performance.	cmos;gain–bandwidth product;large-signal model;miller–rabin primality test;new foundations;operational amplifier;small-signal model;transistor	Alfio Dario Grasso;Gaetano Palumbo;Salvatore Pennisi;Davide Marano	2018	2018 International Conference on IC Design & Technology (ICICDT)	10.1109/ICICDT.2018.8399750	transconductance;engineering;operational amplifier;electronic engineering;capacitive sensing;capacitor;transistor;transient response;amplifier;cmos	EDA	62.182941792800555	47.3931496144454	182063

The considered bandpass configurations have in their loop filter a cascade of standard second-order resonator structures in order to achieve appropriate noise shaping. The quantisation noise in each stage is suppressed by feeding the error of each section into the input of the following stage. It is demonstrated in this paper that the quadruple effective-first-order cascade configuration has significantly better performance as well as conforming more closely with theory in comparison with the effectivesecond-order effective-second-order cascade. The superior performance of the former can be attributed to the cumulative effect of the multi-bit outputs as well as the presence of more notch filters.	delta-sigma modulation;first-order predicate;noise shaping;quadruple-precision floating-point format;quantization (signal processing);simulation	Mohammed Al-Janabi;Izzet Kale;Richard C.

Our circuit was derived from a piecewise linear oscillator model proposed by Matsuoka, well known as a building block for constructing a robot locomotion controller. We modified Matsuoka’s oscillator to be suitable for analog current-mode integrated circuit implementation, and designed and fabricated it as an analog current-mode circuit. Through circuit simulations and experimental results on a fabricated chip, we demonstrate that our neuromorphic oscillator generates a stable oscillation, and the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation can be controlled by tuning bias currents over a wide range. Further, we propose a compensation for device mismatch in the neuromorphic oscillator through feedback from a coupled physical system. r 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The transition response time within reference switching and transient load regulation is significantly reduced by utilizing the discrete-voltage control technique and the half digitally-assistant voltage accelerator. The proposed LDO regulator provides two selectable discrete-voltage outputs of 2.8 V and 1.8 V by using the discrete-voltage control technique. The settling time is reduced by utilizing the half digitally-assistant voltage accelerator when the output voltage is switching. Furthermore, the new comparator architecture is proposed to avoid large under−/over-shoot voltage of the LDO output. According to the experimental results, the settling time of the proposed LDO regulator can be significantly reduced from 4.2 ms to 14.892 μs. Moreover, the discrete-voltage control unit and the half digitally-assistant voltage accelerator of the proposed LDO regulator consume only 0.11 mW under a load current of 100 mA. The figure of merit (FOM) of the proposed LDO regulator is improved by over 20 %, in comparison to previous works.	dropout (neural networks);low-dropout regulator	Wei-Bin Yang;Ming-Hao Hong;Jsung Mo Shen	2017	Signal Processing Systems	10.1007/s11265-016-1205-7	comparator;dropout voltage;voltage;architecture;settling time;low-dropout regulator;regulator;load regulation;computer science;control theory	Arch	61.66871961372878	46.64244980276173	183122

The linearity will be strongly increased by implementing original techniques, while the silicon occupied area per function will be reduced as a result of the circuit multifunctionality. The structure is implemented in 0:35 m CMOS technology and is supplied at 3V. The circuit presents a very good linearity (THD < 0:1% for di®erential ampli ̄er and active resistors and THD < 0:15% for multiplier), correlated with an extended range of the input voltage ( 1:5V < v1 v2 < 1:5V).

Differential difference amplifier based structure performs high input impedance, and the subthreshold operation with capacitive-coupled chopping topology achieves a great noise efficiency. A DC servo loop is implemented without using pseudo-resistors to perform high-pass transfer function and suppress electrode offset. The circuit is designed in standard 0.18-μm CMOS technology and simulated over process corners at extreme temperatures. The results show the key specifications of IA are insensitive to process variations even under extreme temperatures. For typical case, the circuit achieves the input impedance up to 470 MΩs. The input referred noise is 4.7 μV(0.5 Hz to 2.5 kHz) while consuming a current of 470 nA from 1.2 V supply.

119c9b07cf6407a6b48b837ab83caa08db8edefb	synthesis of a reconfigurable analog vector-sum circuit into the mtl-based configurable blocks		Abstract A reconfigurable and programmable implementation of an analog vector summation circuit using an MTL-based synthesis scheme is proposed. This reconfigurable structure, gives the flexibility to program the dimension and gain of the vector-sum function after chip fabrication. This scheme only utilizes squaring blocks to implement the vector-sum function, eliminating the square-root function typically required. The proposed structure utilizes cascoded MTL cells (CMC), a current mirror, and a programmable PMOS array. It is a flexible and reconfigurable structure with capability of implementing nonlinear analog functions such as required squaring function. The proposed approach is capable to realize one-dimensional (absolute-value) to n -dimensional vector-sum functions. The programmable gain factor applied to the implemented functions, is useful for normalization, attenuation and amplification. The theoretical analysis and measurement results verify the feasibility of the proposed reconfigurable vector-sum concept. The prototype device has been fabricated and tested in a 0.5 μ m CMOS technology. As two applications, a programmable full-wave current rectifier along with a frequency doubler have been programmed and tested using the proposed vector-sum circuit.		Mostafa Shaterian;Christopher M.

The GPG makes a narrow pulse from oscillator sinusoidal output and injects it back to gates of tail transistors to reduce the root-mean-square (RMS) value of impulse sensitivity function (ISF) and to improve phase noise. It will be shown that by utilizing a GPG, total phase noise improvement will be as high as 6dB. The proposed circuit was designed and simulated by ADS simulator using 0.18μm TSMC RF CMOS design kit.

The input switched-capacitor network of the modulator under test is reconfigured as two or more subdigital-to-charge converters in the test mode. By properly designing the digital stimuli, the shaped noise power of the digital stimulus can be effectively attenuated. As a result, the shaped noise correlation as well as the modulator overload issues are alleviated, thus improving the test accuracy. A second-order Sigma-Delta modulator design is used as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The behavioral simulation results showed that, when the signal level of the stimulus tone is less than -5 dBFS, the signal-to-noise ratios obtained by the digital stimuli are inferior to those obtained by their analog counterparts of no more than 1.8 dB. Circuit-simulation results also demonstrated that the D 3 T scheme has the potential to test moderate nonlinearity. The proposed D 3 T scheme has the advantages of achieving high test accuracy, low circuit overhead, high fault observability, and the capability of conducting at-speed tests.	decorrelation;delta-sigma modulation	Hao-Chiao Hong;Sheng-Chuan Liang	2009	IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCSI.2008.926986	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;delta-sigma modulation;control theory	EDA	63.77288155937893	49.29297630515089	188751

The circuit consists of an input inverter circuit stage that controls the slope of an output signal from the inverter stage produced in response to an input signal. A second stage is implemented as a source follower and, in response to the inverter stage output signal, provides the output signal applied to the conducting paths of the printed circuit board. A final stage of the circuit compensates for the inability of the source follower stage to utilize, because of the characteristics of the CMOS field effect transistors, the range of voltages provided by the power supplies.

The QFG technique is applied to a static DC current source in the classic class-AB OTA, boosting the bias current for large input voltages. The new proposed OTA consumes the same static power as the traditional OTA, however the chip area is increased by 8.5% due to the extra capacitor required. The class-AB transconductor has been fabricated using a standard 0.5 μm CMOS technology. The circuit consumes 112 μW using a supply voltage of ±0.9 V and a bias current of 5 μA.

The main advantages of the new proposed implementations are the improved linearity, small area consumption and improved frequency response. An original technique for linearizing the I(V) characteristic of the active resistor will be proposed, based on the utilization of a new linear differential amplifier, and on a current-pass circuit. The linearization of the original differential structure is achieved by compensating the quadratic characteristic of the MOS transistor operating in the saturation region by an original square-root circuit. The errors introduced by the second-order effects will be strongly reduced, while the circuit frequency response of the circuit is very good as a result of operating all MOS transistors in the saturation region. In order to design a circuit having a negative equivalent resistance, an original method specific to the proposed implementation of the active resistor circuit will be presented. The circuit is implemented in 0.35 μm CMOS technology, the SPICE simulation confirming the theoretical estimated results and showing a linearity error under a percent for an extended input range (± 500 mV) and a small value of the supply voltage (± 3 V).	frequency response;negative feedback	Cosmin Popa	2009	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126609004880	equivalent circuit;frequency response;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;active load;control theory;linearity;rl circuit	EDA	62.531266066852076	48.20992149691643	194149
b4b0bc4663a6b4e53d3dd1a2ae4d79d74b71d247	multi stage ota design: from matrix description to circuit realization		Abstract This paper presents a comprehensive approach to frequency compensating multistage amplifiers. Different stage cases have been considered namely, differential voltage and current blocks, and general compensation blocks for both voltage and current states. Then, a matrix description has been proposed to describe the configurations. The approach involved binary matrixes in order to model amplifiers with feedback networks. Evolutionary algorithms were used to find optimum numerical values and simplify symbolic transfer functions. Also a diagram-based design was used to find the appropriate MOSFET DC bias conditions and dimensions. Note that using simplified transfer functions to symbolically locate the poles and zeroes allowed a better circuit design knowledge compared to numerical approaches. To demonstrate the proposed procedure, two circuit were designed in TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS technology and simulated results successfully compared to linear models extracted from the matrix description. According to simulations, the proposed configurations in both voltage and current states show excellence performance versus previous works. Finally, special design cases such as multi-compensation blocks and N-stage approach were discussed.

Current estimates are reached by approximate methods that resort to simplified current waveforms, as well as by an exact procedure that carries out the harmonic decomposition of the actual waveform. It has been shown that approximate procedures assuming ripple-free dc current can provide amplitude values significantly different from actual ones. In particular, it has been ascertained that the rectangular waveshape does not always correspond to the worst case as far as harmonic current amplitudes are concerned. The approximate methods that take ripple into account are generally more accurate, but the algorithms required for current amplitudes estimates are not as easy to apply as those valid for ripple-free waveforms. These findings should be kept in mind when systems for harmonic compensation, particularly filters, are to be designed. Moreover, national and international standards, when based on ripple-free dc current assumptions, should be carefully considered.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;ripple effect;waveform	Andrea Cavallini;M.

The employed gain compression technique uses only one positive supply to maintain good linearity, and achieve above 20% better efficiency over a conventional Class-AB design. Without using negative supply, this Class-I amplifier is compatible with a standard CMOS process. Experimental results show that the peak efficiency is 80%.

By utilizing dynamic slew-rate enhancement (SRE) circuit and nested Miller compensation (NMC) on LDO structure, the proposed LDO provides high stability during line and load regulation without off-chip load capacitor. The overshot voltage has been limited within 550 mV and settling time is less than 50 mus when load current reducing from 100 mA to 1 mA. By using 30 nA reference current, the quiescent current is 3.3 muA. The experiment results agree with the simulation results.

The analysis is performed in two separate parts. In the first of these, equations are derived with the assumption of a sinusoidal waveform of outputs, while in the other, the outputs are assumed to be exponential. It is shown that the derived equations for frequency and amplitude are sufficiently exact. In addition, conditions in which sinusoidal and exponential output occur are thoroughly discussed. In the instances in which the results did not satisfy the necessary conditions for sinusoidal output, the output is assumed to be exponential. Moreover, the related analytical equations are written, and the new expressions for frequency and amplitude of ROs are derived. Analytical results are confirmed by simulation results, using the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 0.18?m technology model. The simulation results indicate the high level of accuracy of the proposed model. A new analytical approach is proposed for differential ring oscillators.The exact equations on the amplitude and frequency is derived in the proposed method.It provides the condition which the oscillator passes from being linear to nonlinear.Analytical results confirm the simulation results in 0.5 to 10GHz frequencies.	cmos	Hojat Ghonoodi;Hossein Miar Naimi;Mohammad Gholami	2016	Integration	10.1016/j.vlsi.2015.07.004	embedded system;electronic engineering;radio-frequency engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;cmos	EDA	67.14364390164617	47.54230482482034	195658

The system is designed and simulated based on adaptive loop gain techniques. It utilizes the wide locking range properties and fast acquisition of the high gain loop and enhanced noise performance of the low gain loop. The simulation results confirmed the new system's ability to switch between high and low gain loops in order to acquire fast acquisition, while keeping the loop in lock. In this approach the system will maintain the desired properties of fast acquisition and wide locking. These characteristics are normally in conflict with each other. The noise performance of the system has been tested and shown to give improved jitter and phase noise which makes the loop very attractive frequency synthesis and other communications and control applications.	first-order predicate;frequency synthesizer;lock (computer science);phase noise;phase-locked loop;simulation;zero crossing	Saleh R.

For cochlear implants [1] and retinal prostheses [2], having a miniaturized form factor and being battery-less are highly desirable. Such devices require real-time power transfer in the range of 10 to 100mW [3], and as human tissue specific absorption rate (SAR) increases with frequency, inductively-coupled power links that operate at 13.56MHz or lower in ISM bands are commonly used, as shown in Fig. 4.2.1. However, lower transmission frequency means larger matching and filtering capacitors that are bulky. In addition, the received AC input amplitude VAC,Peak would fluctuate due to changes in distance and orientation between the coupling coils. Hence, comparator- controlled power switches (active diodes) are used to replace diodes so that the rectifier could work at a lower VAC,Peak and still achieve a high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) [4]. In this research, we present the first fully integrated 1X/2X active rectifier in the 30mW range with all capacitors fabricated on-chip, also shown in Fig. 4.2.1. This is made possible by a switching arrangement that avoids connecting the output capacitors in series in the 2X mode. Reverse current is reduced for VAC,Peak that ranges from 1.25 to 4V by a bias current that is quasi-inversely proportional to the output DC voltage, as explained later; and efficiency is carefully measured by the insertion of a sensing resistor plus an additional capacitor to reduce distortion.	active rectification;battery charger;biasing;cochlear implant;diode;distortion;electric power conversion;mobile phone;network switch;real-time clock;rectifier;retinal implant;sfiaplus;series and parallel circuits;transformer;vacuum cleaner;videocassette recorder	Yan Lu;Xing Li;Wing-Hung Ki;Chi-Ying Tsui;C.

It is found that both a lower limit and an upper limit exist for the cascode transistor bias voltage. Further, the use of a signal dependent cascode bias voltage is discussed and a selfbiased cascode configuration is presented. This configuration makes it possible to use a higher effective gate-source voltage for the mirror transistors, hence reducing the effect of threshold voltage mismatch on the current mirror gain. The proposed configuration has the advantage of simplicity combined with a complete elimination of the need for fixed bias voltages or bias currents in the current mirror. A disadvantage is that i t requires a higher input voltage to the current mirror.	biasing;current mirror;dvd region code;dynamic range;transistor	Erik Bruun;Peter Shah	1995		10.1109/ISCAS.1995.520391	mesh analysis;computer vision;dynamic range;electronic engineering;current mirror;engineering;78xx;electrical engineering;amplifier;control theory;threshold voltage;low voltage;dropout voltage;overdrive voltage	Arch	62.53470750733902	47.560732505708685	196839

The proposed regulator for SoC application can achieve high stability for load current from zero to 100mA. The FSR loops can accelerate load transient responses while the regulator achieves the FOM of only 0.00675 (ps) without an output capacitor. The experimental results show the load regulation of 75.2 μV/mA and line regulation of 1.046 mV/V. The whole LDO chip consumes a quiescent current of 27 μA with an ultra low dropout voltage of 142mV at the maximum output current of 100mA. The proposed FSR transient improved loops can effectively reduce the transient voltage undershoot and overshoot. While the load current switches between 0 and 100 mA with both rise and fall time of 1 μs, the result shows that the maximum undershoot is 25 mV and that the maximum overshoot is 5 mV. When the full load current is 100mA, the undershoot and the overshoot of the line transient response are 4 mV and 6.5 mV, respectively, for a 1 V step supply waveform with 5 μs transient time.	biasing;cmos;dropout (neural networks);fall time;line regulation;load regulation;low-dropout regulator;network switch;overshoot (signal);waveform	Chia-Min Chen;Chung-Chih Hung	2011	2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)	10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044985	chip;system on a chip;control engineering;embedded system;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;low-dropout regulator;cmos;dropout voltage;transient response;electric potential	HPC	61.58456561667326	46.67884784962912	197675

Design optimization towards minimal power consumption is demonstrated for the high-speed low-power building blocks of the DeltaSigma modulator. From this point of view, it is shown that GmC integrators are preferred over RC integrators in the low-pass filter of the modulator because they show a better tradeoff between power, speed, and accuracy. A new single-bit quantizer topology is presented that incorporates a local feedback path that improves stability using a switched-voltage technique. Finally, a design methodology for the single-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in the feedback loop is proposed, focusing on the impact of high sampling rates on the stability of the converter. The presented continuous-time ADC achieves a simulated dynamic range of 72 dB and a signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio of 66 dB in a 10-MHz signal bandwidth. Therefore, it can be applied for WLAN broadband communication. The power consumption of the DeltaSigma modulator is limited to 7.5 mW.

This model takes into account the nonstationarity of those transient signals and the special form of their envelope. We also propose an algorithm for the estimation of this model's parameters and we evaluate its performance on synthetic and real signals. The measured transient current signals actually reflect the physical phenomena appearing in the electrical appliances when turning on, and therefore, the model estimates of these transient current signals are useful for characterizing electrical appliances and can be helpful for distinguishing appliances in addition to the use of their steady-state power consumption.	algorithm;dhrystone;estimation theory;genetic algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;steady state;synthetic intelligence	Mohamed Nait Meziane;Philippe Ravier;Guy Lamarque;Karim Abed-Meraim;Jean-Charles Le Bunetel;Yves Raingeaud	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362726	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	AI	67.88716049811944	51.63983335410134	199384
