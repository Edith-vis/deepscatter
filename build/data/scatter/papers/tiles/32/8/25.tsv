609ae317a634cd737f70900af4b7dc26bdf243ef	game-based defending against attacks in software defined networks with routing control		This paper aims at defending the data traffic against an attack in Software Defined Networks (SDNs) by leveraging the flexibility to collect traffic information and control traffic routing in SDN. We first model the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a two-player variable sum game model, and analyze the Nash equilibrium of the proposed game model. By further analyzing the Nash equilibrium, we propose some guidelines to control the traffic routing which can help enhance the traffic security under attacking. Based on these guidelines, we design an online algorithm and an offline algorithm to control the traffic routing. By applying our algorithms to the scenario that the attacker intends to destroy a node to break the traffic, our algorithms can greatly reduce the traffic loss when the network is under attacking.	information and computation;nash equilibrium;online algorithm;online and offline;routing;software-defined networking	Jie Duan;Ruilin Tian;Yuan Xing;Guofeng Zhao;Shuai Zeng;Yuanni Liu	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422324	online algorithm;computer network;computer science;software-defined networking;nash equilibrium	Mobile	-59.69021598259976	69.92192298044351	182367

This kind of spam is appreciated by spammers due to its effectiveness and low cost. Many anti-SPIT solutions are applied to resolve this problem but it is still limited in some cases. We propose in this paper a SPIT detection algorithm based on user's call behavior. Simulation results show the efficiency of our detection method and outline the most significant parameters. We find that the inspection of call duration allows to quickly and precisely discover SPIT messages.	algorithm;sensor;simulation;spamming;user agent	Randa Jabeur Ben Chikha;Tarek Abbes;Adel Bouhoula	2013	2013 21st International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks - (SoftCOM 2013)	10.1109/SoftCOM.2013.6671851	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Robotics	-60.38571409283588	71.46552406529234	182734

In this work, we show that traffic analysis can be performed remotely by taking advantage of a timing side channel. The timing side channel results from a shared resource, namely, the scheduler between two users. Utilizing Shannon equivocation as a privacy metric, we prove that one user can learn the complete traffic pattern of the other user if the scheduler employs a first come first serve (FCFS) policy. Moreover, we show the feasibility of a real system attack exploiting the timing side channel inside a home digital subscriber line (DSL) router. This demonstrates the magnitude of the threat timing side channels pose for traffic analysis.	digital subscriber line;local loop;router (computing);scheduling (computing);shannon (unit);side-channel attack;traffic analysis	Xun Gong;Negar Kiyavash	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6639364	digital subscriber line;information privacy;telecommunications;computer science;network security;privacy;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-56.57293129099883	69.70783429050104	183176

The DDoS attack traffic vastly includes the SYN packets. To handle excessive DDoS traffic without large impact on the benign traffic, it is important to allocate sufficient resource for the defense. With the support from Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology, this can be done in a significantly lower lower cost, with higher flexibility. In this work, we propose a DDoS defense mechanism based on Network Function Virtualization platform, which is capable to balance with the attack load. Our proposed mechanism uses dynamic network agents to intercept packets when the system experiences DDoS attack. In particular, we focus on the mechanism that deploys virtual agents dynamically according to the attack strength. The corresponding load-balancing algorithm dynamically determines the number of agents to allocate for defending the attack traffic. Our simulation results demonstrate that the mechanism can successfully defeat the DDoS attacks with different attack intensities, while it incurs minimal performance degradation on the benign traffic and keeps the increase in the server's response time sufficiently low compared to that of a successful DDoS attack.	algorithm;denial-of-service attack;elegant degradation;intelligent agent;load balancing (computing);network function virtualization;response time (technology);server (computing);simulation;traffic exchange;visual intercept	A.

88a5029319eac2e5402d8b7c0afa411388f4f4d8	cache function activation on a client based dnssec validation and alert system by multithreading		Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the most important services of the Internet since most communications normally begin with domain name resolutions provided by DNS. However, DNS has vulnerability against some kind of attacks such as DNS spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, and so on. DNSSEC is an security extension of DNS to provide secure name resolution services by using digital signature based on public key cryptography. However, there are several problems with DNSSEC such as failing resolution in case of validation failure, increasing the load of DNS full resolver, and so on. To mitigate these problems, we proposed a Client Based DNSSEC Validation System. This system performs DNSSEC validation on the client, and in case of validation failure, it forwards the failed response and alerts the user to the fact. However, this system has a problem that it inactivates the cache function of validation library so that it always performs DNSSEC validation even for the same query. In this paper, we report how to solve this problem by multithreading of DNSSEC validation system.	authentication;dns spoofing;digital signature;domain name system security extensions;failure;internet;javaserver pages;multithreading (computer architecture);public-key cryptography;thread (computing)	Kunitaka Kakoi;Yong Jin;Nariyoshi Yamai;Naoya Kitagawa;Masahiko Tomoishi	2017	2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.78	cache;computer science;dns hijacking;real-time computing;nsupdate;dns zone;dns zone transfer;dns spoofing;computer network;domain name system;dns root zone	Metrics	-56.63703264117643	67.8472678986965	190724
797f5a53d8f16eefab4c1e37c8f7d8095a3636ef	research and implementation of three https attacks	man in the middle attack;ssl;session hijacking;https	With the rapid development of network applications, the issues of Network transmission security become very important. Therefore, SSL protocol is more and more widely used in a variety of network services. But the SSL protocol itself is not perfect, in practice, there are also problems. For the deficiencies of endpoint authentication in the SSL handshake process, the paper analyzes two kinds of defects existing in the SSL hand-shake process. Firstly, handshake process, in the first stage of the SSL connection, using plaintexts, existing the possibility of being monitored and tampered. Secondly, SSL deployment of the actual application. Because of considering the factors about the performance of the network connection, that usually uses the way of switch connection based on HTTP protocol. In response to these deficiencies, this thesis adopts the two ways of forged certificates and converting the data stream from HTTPS to HTTP to attack them. In addition, a new attack mode against the data stream of HTTPS is designed and implemented. Experiments show that the above three methods cause significant security risks to HTTPS communications. Therefore, taking a static ARP table, enhanced certificate mechanism and mutual authentication of three different measures are proposed to enhance network security in the paper. It is shown that three ways can relative effectively defense against attacks on HTTPS in the experiments.	communication endpoint;experiment;https;hypertext transfer protocol;mega man network transmission;mutual authentication;network security;plaintext;software deployment;transmission security;transport layer security	Kefei Cheng;Tingqiang Jia;Meng Gao	2011	JNW	10.4304/jnw.6.5.757-764	man-in-the-middle attack;session hijacking;hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer;telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;transport layer security;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-55.81451583468572	68.88573789694453	190973

However, the dynamism of programmable networks also introduces new security challenges that demand innovative solutions. A critical challenge is efficient detection and reconciliation of potentially conflicting flow rules imposed by dynamic OpenFlow (OF) applications. To that end, we introduce FortNOX, a software extension that provides role-based authorization and security constraint enforcement for the NOX OpenFlow controller. FortNOX enables NOX to check flow rule contradictions in real time, and implements a novel analysis algorithm that is robust even in cases where an adversarial OF application attempts to strategically insert flow rules that would otherwise circumvent flow rules imposed by OF security applications. We demonstrate the utility of FortNOX through a prototype implementation and use it to examine performance and efficiency aspects of the proposed framework.	algorithm;authorization;kernel (operating system);open innovation;openflow;plug-in (computing);prototype	Philip Porras;Seungwon Shin;Vinod Yegneswaran;Martin W.

Second, we go beyond the """"known port"""" limitation by reverse engineering the protocols and identifying characteristic strings in the payload.

Traditional brute-force, high-rate DDoS attacks expose many obvious anomaly features to defense systems, so that they can be easily detected and mitigated. In this paper we propose a new type of low-rate TCP-targeted DoS attack, called NewShrew, which exploits the deficiencies in TCP's timeout mechanism and slow start mechanism. This attack could significantly degrade TCP throughput, while evading the supervision of DoS prevention systems by inconspicuously consuming a small part of network capacity. We use theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of this attack for different RTT heterogeneity, TCP variant, and network environment. We reveal the interactions among the attack parameters, and the trade-offs between throughput degradation and attack cost. Moreover, we empirically show that NewShrew outperforms the classical Shrew DoS attack in terms of lower average attack rate (averagely 47.82%), higher attack efficiency (the ratio between throughput degradation inflicted by an attack and the average attack rate of the attack) with an average of 45.79%, and higher throughput degradation (averagely 11.54%) after deploying a typical defense mechanism (namely, RTO randomization). Our work innovatively exposes TCP slow start mechanism as a possible vulnerability to adversarial attacks, hence it opens new avenue to improving the resilience of TCP.	anomaly detection;attack rate;brute-force search;dos;denial-of-service attack;elegant degradation;interaction;internet;network congestion;numerical analysis;recovery time objective;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput	Jingtang Luo;Xiaolong Yang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883403	packet drop attack;tcp global synchronization;internet privacy;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;application layer ddos attack;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Security	-60.000649714557	68.84671627060929	195545

Pollution attack is an effective attack against P2P live streaming, where attackers upload bogus multimedia data to their peers. The polluted data can spread over the entire network, and cause severe quality degradation of the videos. To resist pollution attacks in P2P live streaming, this paper proposes a trust management system that identifies attackers and excludes them from further sharing of multimedia data. We investigate possible attacks against the trust management system and analyze the attack resistance of the proposed system. Our simulation results show that the proposed trust management system can efficiently detect attackers and stimulate user cooperation even under attacks. It helps users receive more clean data and improves the performance of P2P live streaming.	elegant degradation;peer-to-peer;simulation;streaming media;trust management (information system);upload	Bo Hu;H.

b326b942cc912c287130961911592daad5633210	advanced interest flooding attacks in named-data networking		The Named-Data Networking (NDN) has emerged as a clean-slate Internet proposal on the wave of Information-Centric Networking. Although the NDN's data-plane seems to offer many advantages, e.g., native support for multicast communications and flow balance, it also makes the network infrastructure vulnerable to a specific DDoS attack, the Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). In IFAs, a botnet issuing unsatisfiable content requests can be set up effortlessly to exhaust routers' resources and cause a severe performance drop to legitimate users. So far several countermeasures have addressed this security threat, however, their efficacy was proved by means of simplistic assumptions on the attack model. Therefore, we propose a more complete attack model and design an advanced IFA. We show the efficiency of our novel attack scheme by extensively assessing some of the state-of-the-art countermeasures. Further, we release the software to perform this attack as open source tool to help design future more robust defense mechanisms.	attack model;botnet;denial-of-service attack;forwarding plane;interest flooding attack;multicast;open-source software	Salvatore Signorello;Samuel Marchal;Jérôme François;Olivier Festor;Radu State	2017	2017 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)	10.1109/NCA.2017.8171325	computer network;multicast;robustness (computer science);botnet;computer science;the internet;delay-tolerant networking;attack model;computer security;routing protocol;denial-of-service attack	Security	-56.69152076310709	70.56816045481342	196117

It is often used by computer attackers to characterize hosts or networks which they are considering hostile activity against. Thus it is useful for system administrators and other network defenders to detect portscans as possible preliminaries to a more serious attack. Thus it is of considerable interest to attackers to determine whether or not the defenders of a network are portscanning it regularly. A major difficulty with detecting these portscans on a high-speed monitoring point is that the traffic volume on high speed links can be tens of gigabits per second and can contain millions of flow and high volume of traffic. Our purpose is to detect portscans based on the flow records on the internet. This data set is sometimes too large for us. Fortunately, we have an approach to detect some specific portscan. First, filter out any web traffic on port 80 and other non-TCP flows. So the data sets are reduced significantly. However, the data sets still are too large for us. Then employ sampling on the data sets. There had been many alternative sampling methods. In this paper, we used simple random sampling, considering this method could select flow records uniformly. Finally, with the sampled data, we introduce a new way to identify ports scanners. As the host which scan large number of different destination IP addresses and ports is probably a ports scanners we can compute the entropy of each host, which reflect the distribution of its destination IP addresses and ports. In theory, simple random sampling has minimal impact on the result of entropy of each host. Therefore the estimation of entropy will be more precise. The experimental results show that datum from the sample also can tell which hosts are port scanners accurately. We will see that the attackers' entropy for destination IP address is bigger than others clearly. So entropy-based SYN detection can help us find out scanners effectively.	data rate units;entropy (information theory);geodetic datum;gigabit;internet;monte carlo method;network packet;port scanner;sampling (signal processing);sensor;system administrator;traffic flow (computer networking);web traffic	Hai Zhang;Xuyang Zhu;Wenming Guo	2009		10.1145/1655925.1656116	sampling;entropy;simple random sample;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;statistics	Metrics	-61.41755767433245	68.0021400176291	198423

If the victim node is a server in DMZ requiring fast information processing, the entire network operation stops. We use various lines of honeypot based defence against such attacks. The first line of defence detects the presence of attacks and tags attack flows in real time. The work in this paper concentrates on the next line of defence, where a model for autonomous dynamic honeypot routing has been proposed in response to identified attack flows. We propose the automatic generation of adequate server nodes to service client requests and honeypots to interact with attackers in contained manner. The judicious mixture of servers and honeypots in DMZ at different time intervals provide stable network functionality even in the attacked network. We validate the effectiveness of the approach with modelling on Internet type topology and simulation in ns-2 on a Linux platform.	autonomous robot;block cipher mode of operation;computation;dmz (computing);denial-of-service attack;honeypot (computing);information processing;linux;mean time between failures;quality of service;response time (technology);robertson–seymour theorem;routing;semantic network;server (computing);simulation	Anjali Sardana;Ramesh Chandra Joshi	2008	2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks	10.1109/ICON.2008.4772623	pseudoserver;information processing;computer science;information security;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-58.68509554755833	69.30534107311742	199087
