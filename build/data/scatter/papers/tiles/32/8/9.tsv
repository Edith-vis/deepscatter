7db2314ca2689a0ba0a3680d966aef6c64239432	the exercube: participatory design of an immersive fitness game environment		Exergames have advanced from a trend of the entertainment industry to serious training applications. Nowadays body-centered games can be played at home, as well as in the gym, and provide an effective and motivating workout experience for the player. However, existing solutions often lack a symbiotic and user-centered design approach encompassing the three exergame design levels: the player’s body (input movements), the controller (input device) and the game (story, game mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics). Consequently, existing systems exhibit weaknesses like motion sickness or a lack of audio-visual and narrative design of the physical and virtual play space. As such, the player’s game experiences remain limited. Our work contributes to the sustainable establishment of fitness games as effective and attractive training tools. In this paper, we introduce the “ExerCube” and the design, evaluation, and subsequent re-design of the early stage prototype. The “ExerCube” is a fitness game setting for adults, which affords immersive gameplay experiences while engaging in a playful motor-cognitive and -coordinative functional workout. Our findings show that the preliminary “ExerCube” prototype was usable and well received by the target audience. We report insights about the target audience’s preferences and identify avenues for the implementation of dual flow-based game mechanics, the optimization of the training concept and hardware, as well as for the further development of the game scenario.

4a97bd1bd8af94264a2b538e1bab3266276535e5	tourism and mobile technology	web pages;mobile technology	While tourism presents considerable potential for the use of new mobile technologies, we currently have little understanding of how tourists organise their activities or of the problems they face. This paper presents an ethnographic study of city tourists’ practices that draws out a number of implications for designing tourist technology. We describe how tourists work together in groups, collaborate around maps and guidebooks, and both ‘pre-’ and ‘post-visit’ places. Implications are drawn for three types of tourist technology: systems that explicitly support how tourists co-ordinate, electronic guidebooks and maps, and electronic tour guide applications. We discuss applications of these findings, including the Travelblog, which supports building travel–based web pages while on holiday.	closing (morphology);computer-supported cooperative work;experience;field research;map;web page;eric	Barry A.

But however meaningful the phone is in teenagers' lives, it is not designed to support their need for emotional communication and group identity. The BuddyBeads project suggests alternative communication forms among teenagers, which emphasize their social structures, behaviors and needs. BuddyBeads are techno-jewelry items that facilitate non-verbal and emotional communication among group members, through codes and signals which the group decided upon together. Each group member has a matching jewelry piece and can use it to communicate her emotional state to the other group members.	code;social structure	Ruth Kikin-Gil	2005		10.1145/1085777.1085876	nonverbal communication;mobile telephony;computer science;social structure;collective identity	HCI	-57.75226968173432	-39.59351477276473	151841

We summarized these findings into a set of design requirements for a service supporting mobile interaction among motorcyclists. The Hocman prototype is designed to meet these requirements. It is an application for handheld devices equipped with wireless ad hoc networking interfaces. It uses a peer-topeer architecture to accomplish sharing of HTML documents with peers in the immediate proximity. The aim of sharing is to spark social interaction among motorcyclists during brief encounters. We report a field trial on the prototype service in its naturalistic setting. Despite the unmanageable setting, e.g. the vast area, the speed, and unacquainted users, we demonstrate field trials as an effective approach to get feedback on how well a prototype service fulfils the design requirements. The results indicate that the conceptual idea of Hocman was appreciated, which suggest that the focus on interaction in traffic encounters fit with current practice of motorcycling.	computer;html;hoc (programming language);hypertext transfer protocol;mobile device;mobile interaction;peer-to-peer;prototype;requirement;uvo	Mattias Esbjörnsson;Oskar Juhlin;Mattias Östergren	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45233-1_4	wireless ad hoc network;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;distributed computing;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-56.482501007192525	-42.67368215939483	151895

When worn continuously it takes an average of 2,000 images per day. It was originally envisaged for use within the domain of Human Digital Memory to create a personal lifelog or visual recording of the wearer's life, which can be helpful as an aid to human memory. However, within this paper, we explore its applicability as a tool for use within observational and ethnographic studies. We employed the SenseCam as a tool for the collection of observational data in an empirical study, which sought to determine the information access practices of molecular medicine researchers. The affordances of the SenseCam making it appropriate for use within this domain, as well as its limitations, are discussed in the context of this study. We found that while the SenseCam, in its current form, will not offer a complete replacement of traditional observational methods, it offers a complimentary and supplementary route to the collection of observational data.	information access;lifelog;microsoft research;microsoft sensecam;wearable computer	Daragh Byrne;Aiden R.

Co-creative tangibles are designed and evaluated in the RHYME project, where the goal is to improve health and well being for children with severe disabilities through music and physical interaction. The main contribution of this paper is to make sense of Universal Design of co-creative tangibles through the concept of familiarity. Familiarity is described by engagement, understanding and an intimate or close relationship between the user and the technology. We propose familiarity as a concept for understanding and developing Tangible Interaction solutions for all.	human–computer interaction;tangible user interface	Jo Herstad;Harald Holone	2012		10.1145/2399016.2399031	universal design;human–computer interaction	HCI	-58.16988214711367	-41.47807398671299	152823

Leveraging a crowd of smartphone users to collect annotated activity data in the wild is a promising direction because the data being collected are realistic and diverse. However, current research lacks a systematic analysis comparing different approaches for collecting such data and investigating how users use these approaches to collect activity data in real world settings. In this paper, we report results from a field study investigating the use of mobile crowdsourcing to collect annotated travel activity data through three approaches: Participatory, ContextTriggered In Situ, and Context-Triggered Post Hoc. In particular, we conducted two phases of analysis. In Phase One, we analyzed and compared the resulting data collected via the three approaches and user experience. In Phase Two, we analyzed users’ recording and annotation behavior as well as the annotation content in using each approach in the field. Our results suggested that although Context-Triggered approaches produced a larger number of recordings, they did not necessarily lead to a larger quantity of data than the Participatory approach. It was because many of the recordings were either not labeled, incomplete, and/or fragmented due to the imperfect context detection. In addition, recordings collected by the Participatory approach tended to be more complete and contain less noise. In terms of user experience, while users appreciated automated recording and reminders because of their convenience, they highly valued having the control over what and when to record and annotate that the Participatory approach provided. Finally, we showed that activity type (Driver, Riding as Passenger, Walking) influenced users’ behaviors in recording and annotating their activity data. It influenced the timing of recording and annotating using the Participatory approach, users’ receptivity using the Context-Triggered In Situ approach, and the characteristics of the content of annotations. Based on these findings, we provide design and methodological recommendations for future work that aims to leverage mobile crowdsourcing to collect annotated activity data.	crowdsourcing;field research;in-phase and quadrature components;situated;smartphone;user experience	Yung-Ju Chang;Gaurav Paruthi;Hsin-Ying Wu;Hsin-Yu Lin;Mark W.

These studies have examined ways that people relate to physical and digital objects, observing, for example, that people tend to cherish physical objects more than digital ones. This paper proposes that the value of digital objects may inhere less in an object's identity as a particular item and more in the object's ability to provide access to an intellectual work. The work, a familiar concept in information studies and textual studies, designates a general product of intellectual creation that may be instantiated in many versions. (For example, Shakespeare's Hamlet exists in many editions and forms, which may differ in both content and carrier and yet still are all Hamlet.) The paper demonstrates how the concept of the work can extend research on the perceived value of digital objects. It also shows how a flexible definition of the work can reveal new aspects of a design situation.	human–computer interaction;information science	Melanie Feinberg	2013		10.1145/2470654.2466453	design;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;collecting;digital media;multimedia;memory;world wide web	HCI	-56.95601690680313	-40.185532764915685	154952

Therefore, the existing situation information system couldn’t provide satisfactory service to the user as it provides service only by the information which it received from the sensor. This paper analyzed the problems of the existing user intention awareness system and suggested user intention awareness system to provide a stable and efficient service that fits to the intention of the user compensating this. This paper has collected the behavior data based on the scenario of the sequential behavior course of the user that occurs at breakfast time in the kitchen which is the home domain environment that is closely related to our lives. This scenario course also showed the flow that the goal intentional user intention awareness system acted that it suggested, and showed the sequential course processing the user behavior data by tables and charts.	context awareness	Jung-Eun Lee;Tae Bok Yoon;Jee-Hyong Lee	2007	Int.

We trace back this transition to social needs: people's need for a sense of identity and a sense of belonging. We point out that working with digital content has become near impossible without the use of a PC: the PC has established itself as the 'spider in the web' of content capturing and rendering devices. We then argue that if we accept Web 2.0 leisure activities as a predominantly social phenomenon, these activities belong in the living room. However, for a number of reasons the PC is poorly suited to use in a living room context. As an alternative to a system configuration with centralized, PC-based control, we suggest that a network of dedicated, networked devices may be better suited to the home context.	centralized computing;digital recording;disintermediation;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;online community;online identity;personal computer;socialization;system configuration;usability;user-generated content;web 2.0	J.

The technology can be categorised as being either perceiving or generating odours. In this paper, the major capabilities and application areas of both these categories are highlighted. Typical application areas include the food industry, multimedia, marketing, chemistry, art, medical and health sciences, etc.  Since its first usage in the 1950s, the lack of acceptance and instability of the technology motivated scientists to try to improve the technology and adapt it for human needs. In this study, questionnaires were used to determine whether computer users are ready to accept smell generation as a means of interaction during online shopping. The current social acceptability of the technology as well as the factors which might deter end-user's willingness to use the technology was investigated. It was found that the interest of people in the use of this technology as interaction modality is, to some extent, affected by gender as well as by the amount of Internet experience and that technical difficulties such as cost, potential health risks and lack of accuracy stand in the way of general acceptability.	computer;instability;internet;modality (human–computer interaction);online shopping;simulation;user (computing)	Ray Shih;Pieter J.

In this paper, we describe a mobile reminiscence tool called Memory Karaoke, which facilitates episodic memory exercise through contextualized storytelling of meaningful experiences by using contextual cues such as location, time, and photos. We present results from two studies we conducted with Memory Karaoke to explore which contextual cues contribute to best exercising a person's episodic memory. Our findings suggest that while viewing photos do exercise episodic memory to some extent, additional contextual cues (e.g. location and time) can solicit a greater amount of episodic memory exercise. This suggests that Memory Karaoke's selective capture process and its ability to contextualize memories while users retell stories are two effective features which help it to support episodic memory use. These results, together with positive qualitative feedback, provide promising evidence for Memory Karaoke as a viable mobile alternative for helping older adults to exercise their episodic memory and, in turn, assist them in successfully """"aging in place""""."""	feedback;location awareness	Karen P.

To address privacy concerns, prior studies have identified the direct effects of contextual cues but few have revealed their interaction effects. In reality, contextual cues do not appear in isolation, existence of multiple contextual cues introduces an extra complexity in a user's privacy decision-making. This study aims to address the research question of how contextual cues interactively shape privacy concerns. This study focuses on the Android application downloading context. Three contextual cues (i.e., App popularity, permission sensitivity, permission explanation) are identified. Our experimental study postulates both the direct effect and interaction effects of contextual cues on privacy concerns. This study contributes to literature with a better understanding of the combinatory effects of multiple contextual cues.	android;download;experiment;interactivity;mobile app;privacy	Jie Gu;Yunjie Calvin Xu;Heng Xu;Hong Ling	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.421	privacy software;mobile telephony;sensitivity;computer science;humanoid robot;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-58.06830628255875	-43.62690755101932	160632

We observed that they largely want to engage with photos visually, similarly to their sighted peers, and have developed strategies around photo capture, editing, sharing, and consumption that attempt to mitigate usability limitations of current photography and social media apps. We demonstrate the need for more work examining how young people with low vision engage with smartphone photography and social media, as they are heavy users of such technologies and have challenges distinct from their totally blind counterparts. We conclude with design considerations to alleviate the usability barriers we uncovered and for making smartphone photography and social media more accessible and relevant for VIPs.	smartphone;social media;usability	Cynthia L.

In a physically compact enclave such as the urban university in which this wiki is being implemented, context-aware applications can support a hybrid community in which individuals develop and sustain physical and virtual social ties. Participants in this study were first-time users. They were given a guided tour of the wiki and then their impressions, concerns and intention to use were elicited through a semi-structured interview. Participants were enthusiastic about the prospects of the wiki in assisting them in learning about events and interesting places on campus, and in exchanging information. However, they were concerned about issues such as privacy, accuracy, and the potential for intentional misuse of the system. Privacy concerns were based primarily on a misconception of the location-aware feature of the wiki.

We focus on speech and push-button dialog systems requiring neither literacy nor training. Building on the success of Polly, a simple telephone-based voice manipulation and forwarding system that was first tested in 2011, we report on its first large-scale sustained deployment. In 24/7 operation in Pakistan since May 9, 2012, as of mid-September Polly has spread to 85,000 users, engaging them in 495,000 interactions, and is continuing to spread to 1,000 new people daily. It has also attracted 27,000 people to a job search service, who in turn listened 279,000 times to job ads and forwarded them 22,000 times to their friends. We report users' activity over time and across demographics, analyze user behavior within several randomized controlled trials, and describe lessons learned regarding spread, scalability and sustainability of telephone-based speech-based services.	dialog system;interaction;polly (robot);push-button;randomized algorithm;scalability;software deployment;web search engine	Agha Ali Raza;Farhan ul Haq;Zain Tariq;Mansoor Pervaiz;Samia Razaq;Umar Saif;Ronald Rosenfeld	2013		10.1145/2470654.2481389	functional illiteracy;entertainment;simulation;human–computer interaction;operating system;multimedia;world wide web;information system	HCI	-55.65703218106017	-41.54240340090692	163463

Given the environmental impact of food waste, there is potential to make a significant difference. To understand everyday domestic practices around food and waste, we took a “practice” lens and carried out a study in 14 households that involved interviews, in-home tours and, in five of the households, a FridgeCam technology probe. The analysis highlights that food waste is the unintended result of multiple moments of consumption dispersed in space and time across other integrated practices such as shopping and cooking, which are themselves embedded in broader contextual factors and values. We highlight the importance of respecting the complex negotiations that people make within given structural conditions and competing values and practices, and suggest design strategies to support dispersed as well as integrated food practices, rather than focusing on waste itself.	embedded system;human–computer interaction	Eva Ganglbauer;Geraldine Fitzpatrick;Rob Comber	2013	ACM Trans.

373264af7feebf449ce9f96854edfdf5186af1f2	geographic information science and the analysis of place and health		The representation of place is a key theoretical advancement that Geographic Information Science can offer to improve the understanding of environmental determinants of health, but developing robust computational representations of place requires a substantial departure from conventional notions of geographic representation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Unlike conventional GIS representations based on either objects or locations, we suggest place representation should incorporate dynamic subjective, experiential, and relational aspects of place, as the influence of place on health behavior concerns not only the features that can be objectively observed at a particular location but also the environmental perceptions of the individual, as molded by biological, social, and experiential characteristics. In addition, assessments of environmental exposures on health outcomes should focus on individuals' time-activity patterns and microenvironment profiles, which form a potentially unique personalized exposure environment for each individual. Addressing these representational challenges via collaborative research has the potential to advance both Geographic Information Science and health research.	environmental exposure;geographic information systems;geographic information science;habitat;personalization;physical object;representation (action)	Jeremy Mennis;Eun-Hye Enki Yoo	2018	Transactions in GIS : TG	10.1111/tgis.12337	remote sensing;geographic information system;computer science	HCI	-59.808851438798364	-42.98488997196759	164498

Six research institutes in Melbourne's Parkville precinct were augmented with web-based information, and volunteers tested the usability of both this content and the augmented reality browser. Participants' feedback concerning the usefulness of the biomedical and healthcare information was very positive; over 75% of participants described the application favourably. Participants expressed a range of preferences regarding the types of information presented and its structure. Several participants felt they had learned something new from the application, and commented positively on the locative and mobile context of the technology. A challenge for science communicators is to provide user-friendly, accessible technologies that provide information of a suitable complexity and allow users to access that information according to their personal preferences. User feedback indicated that the application described in this study generally met these requirements, and shows that smart phone based AR has potential for use in science communication and public engagement with science.	ar (unix);augmented reality;complexity;feedback;location-based game;requirement;science communication;smartphone;usability;web application	Ryan Naylor;Kristine Elliott;Kathleen Gray;Greg Wadley	2011		10.1145/2103354.2103379	human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-56.47086217199517	-43.07735231730566	164594

The circumstances in which a firefighting intervention occurs represent a rather complex challenge for the design of supporting technology. In this paper, we present the results of our work designing an ad hoc ubicomp infrastructure to support navigation of firefighters working in structure fires inside the zone of danger. We take a wider approach, complementing the technical questions with the development of effective navigation practices based on technology available today. We provide an overview of the complete design process, from the theoretical and empirical underpinnings to the construction and evaluation of three iterations of the platform. We report the results of our evaluation and the implications and tensions uncovered in this process, and we discuss the challenges and implications of it for the design of ubicomp for firefighters.	channel (communications);embedded system;hoc (programming language);iteration;message passing;sensor;ubiquitous computing	Leonardo Ramirez;Tobias Dyrks;Jan Gerwinski;Matthias Betz;Markus Scholz;Volker Wulf	2011	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-011-0462-5	navigation;simulation;mobile ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;wearable computer;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;orientation;computer security;ubiquitous computing;firefighting	HCI	-59.69527504702596	-40.95375492425396	164760

This limits a sense of community in urban neighbourhoods to members of one's social network, but what of interactions with those outside of these networks, such as inhabitants of residential spaces? We report on our pilot study of open ended interviews which investigates the different user archetypes whose needs we consider when designing social technology for urban spaces. We propose a design to extend the sense of community in urban neighbourhoods beyond pure network sociality. Through a lens of 'suburban nostalgia' we envision how neighbourhood interactions might be retrofitted in new ways through civic engagement in the enhancement of environments.	interaction;social network	Christine Satchell;Marcus Foth;Greg Hearn;Ronald Schroeter	2008		10.1145/1517744.1517758	community building;social network	HCI	-57.59994451848474	-38.94510183669692	165120

To address this tension, we propose and test an interface for collaborative crime analysis that aims to make analysts more aware of their sensemaking processes. We compare our sensemaking translucence interface to a standard interface without special sensemaking features in a controlled laboratory study. We found that the sensemaking translucence interface significantly improved clue finding and crime solving performance, but that analysts rated the interface lower on subjective measures than the standard interface. We conclude that designing for distributed sensemaking requires balancing task performance vs. user experience and real-time information sharing vs. data accuracy.	real-time data;sensemaking;user experience	Nitesh Goyal;Susan R.

However, an issue that has been mostly neglected in social TV research is how to deal with multiple co-located users in the home. This workshop addresses that gap by investigating possible social TV services for multiple users in the home. The objective is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on different aspects of multi-user services for social television including multiple devices: user research, prototype design, technical implementation, system scalability, business models, etc.	multi-user;prototype;scalability;social television;user research	David Geerts;M.

In this talk I will present empirical results from fieldwork observations and experiments over the last few years which detail the extent to which information workers multitask, irrespective of their organizational role. I will discuss how multi-tasking impacts various aspects of collaboration and communication in the workplace. More recently, our current work uses sensors to measure multi-tasking. Not only do information workers switch continually among multiple tasks but they also switch continually among interactions in varied workplace contexts, such as the work home and organization. We found that people compensate for interruptions by working faster, but this comes at a price of experiencing more stress. These results challenge the traditional way that most IT is designed to organize information, i.e. in terms of distinct tasks. Instead, I will discuss how IT should support information organization in a way consistent with how most people were found to organize their work, which is in terms of much larger thematically connected units of work. I will present a prototype of a technology that can help support people in their multi-tasking and will also discuss how the results present opportunities for new social and technical solutions to support multi-tasking in the workplace.	computer multitasking;experiment;field research;information;interaction;knowledge organization;prototype;sensor	Gloria Mark	2011		10.1145/2024288.2024291	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;group information management;social psychology	HCI	-59.59496796263573	-41.548880438883785	166886

Yet because of conflicting schedules and time zone differences, it can be hard to communicate synchronously with others. To help address this problem we explored the design of an asynchronous media sharing application called Mimo. Mimo allows family members to capture and share moments with each other using audio narratives as a way to connect time and activities together. We evaluated Mimo with participants who thought about and reflected on its design. Our results point to the value of connecting family members in a one-to-one, private fashion and how personalization is necessary in systems designed for asynchronous media sharing.	mimo;one-to-one (data model);personalization;synchronization (computer science)	Yasamin Heshmat;Carman Neustaedter;Lillian Yang;Thecla Schiphorst	2017		10.1145/3027063.3053205	personalization;mimo;multimedia;asynchronous communication;time zone;computer science;schedule;distributed computing	HCI	-57.758903948102045	-39.60818903553627	167347

023cd78c1f82dc2c5a58b9938cf3cecf94c9737c	investigating query formulation assistance for children		Popular tools used to search for online resources are tuned to satisfy a broad category of users---primarily adults. Because children have specific needs, these tools may not always be successful in offering the right level of support in their quest for information. While search tools often provide query assistance, children still face many difficulties expressing their information needs in the form of a query. In this paper, we share results from our ongoing research work focused on understanding children's interactions with query suggestions and their preferences with respect to suggestions offered by a general-purpose strategy versus a counterpart designed exclusively for children. Our goal is to inform researchers and developers about when it is necessary to turn to technologies tailored exclusively for children and to further outline needs that should be addressed when it comes to designing query-formulation-related technology for children.	general-purpose modeling;information needs;interaction	Oghenemaro Anuyah;Jerry Alan Fails;Maria Soledad Pera	2018		10.1145/3202185.3210779	human–computer interaction;management science;information needs;computer science	HCI	-61.88311785890628	-42.75461524305558	167979
5a714489f390920e3462369fb2843640a5a2aa9e	narrative construction in information visualisation	qa75 electronic computers computer science	Storytelling has been used throughout the ages as means of communication, conveying and transmitting knowledge from one person to another and from one generation to the next. In various domains, formulating of messages, ideas, or findings into a story has proven its efficiency in making them comprehensible, memorable, and engaging. Information Visualization as an academic field also utilises the power of storytelling to make visualizations more understandable and interesting for a variety of audiences. Although storytelling has been a a topic of interest in information visualization for some time, little or no empirical evaluations exist to compare different approaches to storytelling through information visualization. There is also a need for work that addresses in depth some criteria and techniques of storytelling such as transition types in visual stories in general and data-driven stories in particular. Two sets of experiments were conducted to explore how two different models of information visualization delivery influence narratives constructed by audiences. The first model involves direct narrative by a speaker using visualization software to tell a data-story, while the second involves constructing a story by interactively exploring the visualization software. The first set of experiments is a within-subject experiment with 13 participants, and the second set of experiments is a between-subject experiment with 32 participants. In both rounds, an open-ended questionnaire was used in controlled laboratory settings in which the primary goal was to collect a number of written data-stories derived from the two models. The data-stories and answers written by the participants were all analysed and coded using data-driven and pre-set themes. The themes include reported impressions about the story, insight types reported, narrative structures, curiosity about the data, and ease 14 of telling a story after experimenting with each model. The findings show that while the delivery model has no effect on how easy or difficult the participants found telling a data story to be, it does have an effect on the tendency to identify and use outliers’ insights in the data story if they are not distracted by direct narration. It also affects the narrative structure and depth of the data story. Examining some more mature domains of visual storytelling, such as films and comics, can be highly beneficial to this new sub-field of data visualization. In the research in hand, a taxonomy of panel-to-panel transitions in comics has been used. The definitions of the components of this taxonomy have been refined to reflect the nature of data-stories in information visualization, and the taxonomy has then been used in coding a number of VAST Challenge videos. The transitions used in each video have been represented graphically with a diagram that shows how the information was added incrementally in order to tell a story that answers a particular question. A number of issues have been taken into account when coding transitions in each video and when designing and creating the visual diagram, such as nested transitions, the use of sub-topics, and delayed transitions. The major contribution of this part of the research is the provision of a taxonomy and description of transition types in the context of narrative visualization, an explanation of how this taxonomy can be used to code transitions in narrative visualization, and a visual summary as a means of summarising that coding. The approaches to data analysis and different storytelling axes, both in the experimental work and in proposing and applying the framework of transition types used, can be usefully applied to other studies and comparisons of storytelling approaches.	data visualization;diagram;experiment;information visualization;interactivity;nonlinear gameplay;taxonomy (general);theme (computing);transmitter;visualization software	Donia Badawood	2015			simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-61.37162019594765	-38.825609545240944	168776

Existing methods have already employed visual media as a means to analyse context. Utilizing the capabilities of modern smartphones, we present 'BehindTheCamera' (BTC) that goes beyond traditional photography by adding another perspective through the simultaneous use of front and back cameras. A thematic analysis of the results of a field study involving 30 people working in pairs revealed six categories of BTC use: Conventional Use, Sense of Location, Facial Tagging, Social Interaction, User Perspective, Technical Perspective. We argue these contribute understandings of context in three ways: humoticons showing the emotional valence of situations; perspective axes through the two cameras connecting distinct aspects of the context; and narrative arcs about potential interactions.	bitcoin;field research;interaction;smartphone;ubiquitous computing	Florian Güldenpfennig;Wolfgang Reitberger;Geraldine Fitzpatrick	2012		10.1145/2414536.2414568	computer vision;user experience design;simulation;context analysis;design methods;human–computer interaction;computer science;photography;multimedia;ubiquitous computing	HCI	-58.431102758213754	-39.85983730205675	168939

Meanwhile some research has been done on energy management of mobile devices, less has been done on mobility devices like electric vehicles. We explore this topic by letting conventional fuel car drivers reflect on their current driving habits through an exploration tool that we developed. Our results demonstrate three dimensions related to energy availability to consider for design of energy dependent mobility devices and provide explanations on how these dimensions could be utilize in our design through energy visualizations. With this we contributed not only by demonstrating aspects of energy availability and mobility, but also through opening up for new interesting possibilities and inquires in our and possibly other domains.	human–computer interaction;mobile device;mobilehci	Anders Lundström;Cristian Bogdan;Filip Kis;Ingvar Olsson;Lennart E.

Tensions often relate to expectations around current and future roles of the technology development. We propose a catwalk technology metaphor where researchers as boundary creatures focus on innovation whilst providing links to prêt-à-porter (ready to wear) developments. Evidence from 140 participants, within three “in-the-wild” field-based learning case studies (for mobile, distributed, sensor and augmented reality systems), conceptualise the researchers’ “boundary creature” role in managing design process tensions. Stakeholders, including participants, expected the research projects to produce ready to wear (prêt-à-porter) boundary objects for current practices even when researchers sought to take catwalk approaches by innovating technologies and changing practices. The researcher design role (RDR) model articulates researchers’ narratives with the design team, stakeholders and users around what is innovated (e.g., technology, activities) and how the intervention changes or sustains current practices.	augmented reality;creatures;restrictive design rules;scalability;while	Anne Adams;Elizabeth Fitzgerald;Gary Priestnall	2013	ACM Trans.

In response, we discuss the potential of heart rate displays in a social context, by means of an augmented cycling helmet that displays heart rate data. We studied how pairs of cyclists engaged with this setup and found that access to another person's heart rate data can result in social interplay which in turn supports engagement with the exertion activity. Through our design process and study, we reveal key dimensions of designing for social uses of heart rate data and wearable displays: temporal and spatial accessibility of data, technology support for its interpretation, and influences on heart rate. We also articulate a set of insights for designers that aim to support social exertion activities with heart rate data. As such, our work expands our understanding of wearable technologies' unique interaction opportunities.	accessibility;experience;interviews;interaction;the australian;victoria (3d figure);wearable computer;zephyr	Wouter Walmink;Danielle Wilde;Florian Mueller	2014		10.1145/2540930.2540970	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-56.35921547353264	-42.07662066075682	169603

We present the results of 24 in-depth, qualitative interviews with STEM faculty. The interviews addressed topics such as daily work, sources of work satisfaction and success, work goals, activities, needs, and difficulties. The results provide an insight into the busy lives of STEM academics and can be useful to other efforts that aim to design for this user group. We discuss how we used these results, presented in the form of a persona, to evaluate existing design decisions and to create new features that would serve this audience.

Based on observations, participant interviews, and a focus group with representatives from the local government authority, the contribution of this research is twofold. First, we propose five elements to guide the design of digital pop-up interventions for community engagement. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining digital interfaces and a physical pop-up within a civic space equipped with a large urban screen to engage wider cross-sections of the public. From that, we derive insights about the utilisation of this approach in attracting the attention of people who do not generally attend traditional community engagement events, and provide a more seamless consultation process by enabling citizens to submit their responses on the spot.	bespoke;drupal;focus group;iterative method;seamless3d;situated;spaces	Joel Fredericks;Martin Tomitsch;Luke Hespanhol;Ian McArthur	2015		10.1145/2838739.2838759	simulation;human–computer interaction;multimedia;management	HCI	-56.76262612688778	-38.73446895996955	171231

Based on past work in social psychology and in environmental visualization, we present a design space for social visualizations that considers issues such as anonymity, dimensionality, and competition vs. collaboration. We describe the design and implementation of a social visualization of energy saving behavior. This visualization goes beyond past examples in that it includes both uni-dimensional and multi-dimensional comparative feedback. It is designed to scale to a small group of dorms or a whole city. We evaluated our visualization in the context of a dorm competition at a small liberal arts college. While this was a preliminary study, it helps to provide formative data on the value of our visualization.	action potential;credit bureau;file spanning;ibm notes;relevance	Catherine Grevet;Jennifer Mankoff;Scott D.

We think that the children's lack of purpose makes them bored and do things that irritate their parents. Such behavior worsens the parent-children relationship during shopping. We propose a treasure hunting game to give children a particular purpose, named tekuPico. We designed and implemented the game and then conducted a field study to verify its effectiveness. Results show the game could improve the relationship between parents and children, however, it also showed two shortcomings in our game design: S1: parents do not have enough shopping time, and S2: tekuPico cannot guarantee guiding children to the shops to which their parents want to go. To resolve these, we redesigned tekuPico introducing a new """"key-bar zones system""""."""	field research;video game design	Naomi Iga;Asuka Wakao;Kohei Matsumura;Roberto Lopez-Gulliver;Haruo Noma	2017		10.1145/3130859.3131320	simulation;shopping mall;computer science;game design;treasure	HCI	-58.26766144132531	-41.66774940977798	172723

It is unclear, however, what the impetus behind these motivations are and whether individuals are motivated to use PNAs for other reasons. To explore these questions, we analyzed a dataset of 14 active PNA users' semi-structured interviews and found that participants' first experiences using PNAs were associated with significant life events such as moving to a new area or ending a relationship. We conducted an online survey (N=142) to explore these findings further and investigate whether they generalized across a broader set of active PNA users. We confirm our past findings and contribute ways in which future technologies can detect specific life changes to increase the opportunities for individuals to benefit from PNAs.	experience;homepna;human–computer interaction;online and offline;semiconductor industry;sensor;ubiquitous computing	Joey Chiao-Yin Hsiao;Tawanna Dillahunt	2017		10.1145/3027063.3053099	simulation;semi-structured interview;management science;management	HCI	-60.60445593109187	-41.4300007722827	173333

However, such studies are often limited in the number of participants and duration of the trial, particularly if the researchers are providing the participants with hardware. Apple’s App Store and similar application repositories have become popular with smartphone users, yet few ubiquitous computing studies have yet utilised these distribution mechanisms. We describe our experiences of running a very large scale trial where such a distribution model is used to recruit thousands of users for a mobile system trial that can be run continuously with no constrained end date. We explain how we conducted such a trial, covering issues such as data logging and interviewing users based in several different continents. Benefits and potential shortcomings of running a trial in this way are discussed and we offer guidance on ways to help manage a large and disparate user-base using in-application feedback measures and web-based social networking applications. We describe how, through these methods, we were able to further the development of a piece of ubiquitous computing software through user-informed design on a mass scale.	app store;component-based software engineering;data logger;embedded system;expect;interaction;mobile device;personalization;smartphone;social engineering (security);ubiquitous computing;user experience;video game development;web application	Donald McMillan;Alistair Morrison;Owain Brown;Malcolm Hall;Matthew Chalmers	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12654-3_13	embedded system;simulation;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;data mining;information design;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network;social network	HCI	-62.21634438237256	-45.03269071895374	174889

Bennett directed his challenge to a group of information scientists who attended The User Interface for Interactive Search of Bibliographic Data Bases Workshop. During the workshop, participants exchanged their insights and experiences on various aspects of user interface requirements for interactive IR systems and discussed system design features that could result in the design of more effective user interfaces for information retrieval. The main goals of this review are to characterize interactive IR design trends over time, examine the extent to which IR systems have responded to Bennettu0027s design challenge, and to suggest potential future research directions and challenges.	information retrieval	Pamela A.

613d93b538340616d2e93dc185e00cc816cb2b5b	independent bathing for older adults: the conceptualization of the imagic-box portable walk-in bathtub		The rising issue of world population ageing has brought about increasing concern for the well-being and healthcare needs of older adults. With the unfortunate current state of professional elderly healthcare, the duty of caring for their needs often falls to family members. With current trends pointing towards a shift to a more independent lifestyle for older adults, it becomes increasingly important that technologies are developed to assist their daily living. This paper describes issues involving the everyday task of bathing in tandem with the advent of the walk-in bathtub concept. Unfortunately, due to severe design flaws, conventional market offerings of walk-in bathtubs tend to cause more harm than good, prompting a need for an overhaul of the design concept. Hence, this paper outlines the conceptualization and design methodology of the iMagic-BOX portable walk-in bathtub, a series of mobile, walk-in bathing and shower units designed to assist older adults to be able to independently and comfortably bathe on their own. The goal of this paper is to showcase the individual design elements of these specialized walk-in bathtub units in hopes of inspiring other inventors to appreciate the role of gerontechnology in improving the lives of older adults worldwide.	conceptualization (information science)	Chew Kien Ming;Jeffery Yeow Teh Thiry	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-57931-3_13	developmental psychology;forensic engineering	HCI	-60.29956801164543	-38.75577728049129	176340

This paper reports on an empirical study examining the influence of randomness on the user experience of music listening. 113 instances of self-reporting were collected and analysed according to four themes: listening mode, content organisation, activities during listening, and affective outcomes. The analysis provides insights into how randomness is used to engender certain affective responses (such as feeling refreshed) by using various constraining techniques (such as playlists) whilst engaging in everyday activities (such as driving a car). The paper argues that randomness can be used as an innovative design resource for supporting rich and novel user experiences.	blog;finalize (optical discs);randomness;reflections of signals on conducting lines;user experience;web search engine;while;ipod	Tuck Wah Leong;Frank Vetere;Steve Howard	2006		10.1145/1142405.1142428	design;user experience design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-59.43731068928657	-38.36678298435377	176682

The multi-modal sensors and rich features of smartphones can capture abundant information about users' life experience, such as taking photos or videos on what they see and hear, and organizing their tasks and activities using calendar, to-do lists, and notes. Such vast information can become useful to help users recalling episodic memories and reminisce about meaningful experiences. In this paper, we propose to apply autobiographical memory framework to provide an effective mechanism to structure mobile life-log data. The proposed model is an attempt towards a more complete personal life-log indexing model, which will support long term capture, organization, and retrieval. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model, we propose some design solutions for enabling users-driven capture, annotation, and retrieval of autobiographical multimedia chronicles tools.	activity recognition;focus group;iteration;lifelog;mobile operating system;modal logic;organizing (structure);requirement;sensor;smartphone;socialization;tag (metadata);usability testing;user interface	Dian Tjondronegoro;Tat-Seng Chua	2012		10.1145/2428955.2428973	computer science;operating system;mobile technology;multimedia;world wide web;computer security;lifelog;autobiographical memory	HCI	-56.63427674826958	-42.27844622254098	176729

TimeAware employs an ambient widget to promote self-awareness and to lower the feedback access burden, and web-based information dashboard to visualize people's detailed computer usage. To examine the effect of framing on individual's productivity, we designed two versions of TimeAware, each with a different framing setting-one emphasizing productive activities (positive framing) and the other emphasizing distracting activities (negative framing), and conducted an eight-week deployment study (N = 24). We found a significant effect of framing on participants' productivity: only participants in the negative framing condition improved their productivity. The ambient widget seemed to help sustain engagement with data and enhance self-awareness. We discuss how to leverage framing effects to help people enhance their productivity, and how to design successful productivity monitoring tool.	framing (world wide web);framing (social sciences);personal computer;self-awareness;software deployment;web application	Young-Ho Kim;Jae Ho Jeon;Eun Kyoung Choe;Bongshin Lee;KwonHyun Kim;Jinwook Seo	2016		10.1145/2858036.2858428	simulation;human–computer interaction;multimedia;self-monitoring;framing effect;world wide web	HCI	-61.00887184889073	-44.01995663891535	176769

This paper describes an experiment to measure de facto trust in Wi-Fi hotspots in public places, as opposed to examining trust behaviour in a simulated lab setting. We investigated two hypotheses about the effect of location-specific images in the hotspot's pages on trust behaviours, compared to images of non-specific locations. We found a significant result which confirms that decisions to access an unfamiliar Wi-Fi hotspot can be affected by location-relevant images.	hotspot (wi-fi);java hotspot virtual machine;situated;ubiquitous computing	Tim Kindberg	2008		10.1145/1357054.1357084	phishing;computer science;information security;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;privacy;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computational trust;field research	HCI	-57.96855390118097	-43.118129706356264	177418

Therefore, a greater understanding of information sharing behaviours is necessary in order to build comprehensive, socially-embedded sports applications. To this purpose, we interviewed 46 practitioners in three outdoor sports: trail running, climbing, and skiing. Our qualitative study investigates how participants share information in the context of outdoor sports and how current technology supports this practice. Through thematic analysis, we derived five themes that describe the current information sharing practices: nature, risk and planning, content selection, audience selection, and privacy. Based on these themes, we present five recommendations for design that can inform, inspire and refine future sharing technologies for outdoor sport.	embedded system	Pawel W.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience significant challenges in community engagement and social activities, yet they have strong interests in video games. Thus, there has been increasing interest in understanding potentially positive and negative effects of video games in this population. However, research has not yet examined the perspectives of individuals with ASD themselves on this topic. The purpose of this study was to use qualitative methods to examine the preferences and motivations for video game play among adults with ASD. Individual interviews were conducted with 58 adults with ASD, and responses were coded through an iterative and collaborative process. Several themes were identified, including perceived benefits of video game use (e.g., social connection, stress reduction) as well as perceived negative effects (e.g., time use, addictive potential). Participants also noted both positive and negative aspects of game design that affect their overall enjoyment. The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%). These qualitative findings enhance our understanding of video game use from the direct perspectives of individuals with ASD, and suggest a need for incorporating these perspectives in future quantitative studies on positive and negative aspects of game use in this population.

301ac5e2480137370d06ac7c6800a4dff300c6c3	notification agents for mobile route guidance		Ubiquitous and mobile computing has become an important field in computer science. The provision, management and transmission of information within computer systems and for human-computer interaction is required for many applications and the individual needs of the mobile user are manifold. Due to information overflow it is difficult for the user to access specific pieces of information while key information for decision makers is often missing. Technologies for the emerging field of information logistics are studied in order to enable an optimal information supply with respect to the individual users needs. A dominant application area for this is mobile route guidance, especially when it comes to messaging about alternative routes. Such alternative routes might be advantageous in case of unexpected incidents such as the emergence of an additional train (or cancellation) so that the traveller may reach his/her destination earlier. The main contribution of this thesis is the conceptualization of a method for the selection of individual notifications for mobile route guidance which considers future notification options and the information quality gain to be achieved. Two scenarios are used for the demonstration of continuous individual messages for the traveller notifying him about the best route to follow. Explicit models for the uncertainty about future situations are introduced and the uncertainty reduction by waiting for more information is quantified. The topology of the transportation network is considered and used as a structural model for the construction of influence diagrams as decision models. These influence diagrams answer the questions about the best notifications to be sent both with respect to time and content. Our approach goes beyond probabilistic route planning, which selects a route with maximum expected utility. Other than that, future notification options are considered and the best notification policy is selected rather than the best route. By this, the expected utility can be improved with respect to the standard approach.	automated planning and scheduling;best practice;computer science;conceptualization (information science);decision problem;emergence;expected utility hypothesis;human–computer interaction;influence diagram;information logistics;information overload;information quality;mobile computing	Markus Schaal	2004			simulation;engineering;transport engineering;computer security	HCI	-59.57662586017412	-43.22971640804978	178173

Instead of asking the user to define his preferences, we acquire them automatically using a reinforcement learning approach. Experiments showed that our system succeeded the learning of user preferences. In order to validate the relevance and usability of such a system, we have first conducted a user study. 26 non-expert subjects were interviewed using a model of the final system. This paper presents the methodology of applying reinforcement learning to a real-world problem with experimental results and the conclusions of the user study.	ambient intelligence;bluetooth;context-aware network;eb-eye;experiment;interaction;personalization;prototype;reinforcement learning;relevance;requirement;usability testing;user (computing)	Sofia Zaidenberg;Patrick Reignier;Nadine Mandran	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16239-8_44	user;user experience design;error-driven learning;user modeling;computer user satisfaction;ambient intelligence;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;reinforcement learning	HCI	-60.94472686608208	-44.65790739366433	178431

When users do not share a common metaphorical model for using these technologies, interpersonal communication breakdowns can occur. Through a set of three 8-week-long field deployments and one ongoing observation in-house, we conducted contextual inquiries around the uses of a relatively new communication technology, a mobile remote presence (MRP) system. We observed many nonhuman-like metaphors (e.g., orienting toward the system as a robot, an object) and human-like metaphors (e.g., a person, or a person with disabilities). These metaphors influence people's expectations about social norms in using the systems. We found that there is a serious risk of creating interpersonal conflict when the metaphors are mismatched between people (e.g., locals use nonhuman-like metaphors when remote pilots use human-like metaphors).

In contrast to the input collected by an already fielded mobile app called Atmos, we envision the public display component to provide not only highly localized information about current and future weather conditions, but also to better incentivize the reporting process, given its public nature. In our upcoming deployment of WeatherUSI, we plan to investigate how participation through the public display component differs from the mobile component, and if the quality of weather related input differs between the two. This work in progress presents our approach, describes the underlying system infrastructure and outlines our planned study design.	crowdsourcing;emc atmos;mobile app;software deployment	Evangelos Niforatos;Ahmed Fouad;Ivan Elhart;Marc Langheinrich	2015		10.1145/2757710.2776802	public relations;simulation;geography;advertising	HCI	-57.43583036036395	-38.84901489393395	179801

Yet mobile data collection technologies that have the potential to lower the costs and increase the accuracy of volunteer-collected data are not commonly used in these campaigns. In this paper we conduct a series of studies that reveal the complex issues affecting technology adoption in this domain. First, we surveyed and interviewed existing volunteering campaigns to map out current technology usage within volunteer campaigns. Next, we provided two organizations with a customizable tool for data collection (Sensr) and studied its use and non-use across six real volunteer-driven campaigns over six months. Our study explored success and failure across the first few phases of the campaign lifecycle (campaign creation, initial deployment, and adoption). Our results highlight the impact of resource constraints, cognitive factors, the depth of volunteer engagement, and stakeholders' perspective on technology as important factors contributing to the adoption and usage of mobile data collection technologies. We use these findings to argue for specific design features to accelerate the adoption and use of such tools in volunteer data collection campaigns.	object lifetime;software deployment	Sunyoung Kim;Jennifer Mankoff;Eric Paulos	2015		10.1145/2702123.2702378	citizen science;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;management science;data collection	HCI	-61.049154699671895	-41.134682936899665	180095

TEAL spaces support students in projecting presentations (e.g. from smart-phones) and sharing notes (e.g. from smart-watches) with peers. Importantly, this sharing is partly amongst their co-present small group but sometimes to the whole class. However, plugging personal things into smart spaces whose first requirement is to accept as many devices as possible is not without consequence. A projected notification of a political conversation, for example, has the potential to harm the individual both within the space and beyond, opening them to unwanted judgment, criticism and assessment.  The traditional argument from the usable security community is that of intervention prior to any use whatever: users need to be trained, taught and/or nudged to avoid such problems. We conducted an informal focus group with students in a pilot TEAL space, exploring issues around the privacy and security of using personal devices in such spaces. The reality is that it is hard to perceive the privacy and security challenges prior to using the space. We argue that such prior interventions are not only a significant barrier to student adoption of smart spaces, but ineffective in ensuring the safety of individuals in the long-term.  We argue that in designing smart spaces, both on-campus and off, designers need to adopt an approach of individually evolved privacy requirements to ensure an on-going safe, creative space for students. Two important features are: (a) as a small group develops bonds, its privacy level needs to be reduced over time and (b) the best privacy level depends on the whether the screen is currently shared with the small group or the large class.	denial-of-service attack;emoticon;focus group;privacy;requirement;smartphone;spaces;usability testing	Joseph Maguire;Steve Draper	2017		10.1145/3137003.3137009	security community;conversation;active learning;internet privacy;focus group;harm;usable;criticism;psychological intervention;computer science	HCI	-62.64772040121071	-42.417435140302366	180850

In this paper, we present a collaborative environment that enables group members to create and share content simultaneously by providing them with different kinds of individual input devices and a shared workspace. We also report on an exploratory study to investigate the influence of the input device used on the shared knowledge produced by the group. The results suggest that driven by the affordances, various input devices complement each other. We thus recommend groups to be equipped with multitude of them to support diverse meeting task demands. Additionally, we observed that groupware usage differs across various phases of the problem-solving activity. This provides implications for the design of collaborative environments to assist each of the respective phases of the task, in order to extend their usefulness for the group.	collaborative software;complementarity (physics);input device;integrated development environment;problem solving;workspace	Himanshu Verma;Flaviu Roman;Silvia Magrelli;Patrick Jermann;Pierre Dillenbourg	2013		10.1145/2441776.2441855	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;computer-supported cooperative work;multimedia	HCI	-62.29056792568757	-39.89249490295116	180924

Aiming to provide the first insight into the characteristics of Snapchat users, this study (N = 235) drew on the limited existing Snapchat research base, uses and gratifications theory, and other social media research to derive a range of research questions about Snapchat users vs. non-users. As hypothesised, Snapchat users were younger, placed significantly more importance on social connectedness than non-users, reported significantly greater reliance on graphics in communication, were more likely engage with technology regularly, had greater comfort with technological multitasking, and showed a stronger preference for online social interaction than non-users. However, in contrast to predictions, a desire for instantaneous interaction and reward was not significantly associated with Snapchat use. The findings are considered in terms of a proposed research agenda, including relevant theoretical paradigms (such as belongingness, technology acceptance, psycholinguistic, and semiotic theories) and applied outcomes (such as social capital and communication). Frameworks for future Snapchat research are provided.	snapchat	Rachel Grieve	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.032	psychology;social science;social capital;mobile technology;multimedia;sociology;social psychology;world wide web;visual communication	ECom	-59.41796239680083	-44.9126841629085	182601

In this context, the human–computer interaction aspects of integrated media and social communication are examined. The design of “Social TV” systems that support interpersonal communication, which is motivated by mass media consumption and which takes place within colocated groups or over distance, is explored. In terms of the temporal dimension, Social TV might be synchronous, which happens in real time, or asynchronous, which happens with a time difference.

How to achieve this, in the context of mobile phone usage by South African seniors, is a moot point. We considered this question from two possible perspectives: universal (one-world) versus focused design (designing for diverse """"islands"""" of users). Each island would be characterised by a measure of relative homogeneity in terms of user interface needs. Our particular focus in this paper is age diversity. The universal approach attempts to deliver a design that can be all things to all people meeting the needs of all users within one user interface. The islander approach delivers specific and different designs for islands within a diverse world. To determine which the best approach would be, in the South African context, we dispatched a team of student researchers to interview participants from an older generation, on a one-to-one basis. It was beneficial to deploy aspiring designers to carry out this research because we wanted to confront aspiring researchers with the differences between their own and other generations' usage of, and attitudes towards, mobile phones. Our study found that there were indeed significant age-related differences in mobile phone usage. Our research delivered insights that led to a model of the factors impacting mobile phone usage of the senior generation as a series of filters between the user and their device. We conclude that the island approach is more suitable for age-specific design. This approach might well become less fitting as a more technologically experienced population ages, but at present there is a clear need for an age-sensitive mobile interface design."""	mobile phone;one-to-one (data model);user interface	Karen Renaud;Rénette J.

The main goal was to enhance and augment the experience of a visit to a culturally significant place, the childhood home of the children's book author Astrid Lindgren. Visiting sites of historical significance is not limited to the cultural experience itself, but can be seen as an opportunity for learning and exploring a place as it is now and as it has been in past times. By investigating the two design dimensions place and time, our application was conceived as a treasure hunt, where users activate content by moving between places and pointing the mobile device in different directions or at different markers. The application was field tested with mixed groups of children and adults. The evaluation indicates that the prototype did encourage both learning and exploring, which also was the design objective.	augmented reality;mobile device;prototype	Susanna Nilsson;Mattias Arvola;Anders Szczepanski;Magnus Bång	2012		10.1145/2414536.2414601	augmented reality;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-56.05246910498219	-39.070201401278794	184010

Though there have been attempts to establish group recommendation scenarios, most of them focus on off-line environments. In this article, we present a novel web-based environment that supports online group recommendation scenarios. Specifically, we propose a COllaborative Advisory CHannel for group recommendations called gCOACH. First, we present the conceptual architecture of gCOACH, which is domain independent and is a webbased environment for enabling the interaction of users from anywhere. Second, we introduce the multiple interaction modalities of this environment developed to communicate, coordinate, and persuade the group in a case-based group recommender. We demonstrate its usability through a live-user case-study.	online and offline;recommender system;usability;web application	David Contreras;Maria Salamó;Jordi Pascual	2015	Applied Artificial Intelligence	10.1080/08839514.2015.1026661	knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-62.59013413906002	-39.5363755174045	185327

These devices have become the essential touchpoints for users on their path to purchase. Since recent IS literature does not provide comprehensive measurements for mobile service quality (MSQ), we employed focus groups and critical incident technique to collect 422 user statements related to perceptions of service quality in mobile shopping situations. Our study explores eighteen attributes representing five essential dimensions of MSQ. The results suggest that users assess mobile stores depending on the offered ubiquity of services (e.g., mobility, location-based services), mobile store design (e.g., responsive design, synchronicity, information quality, product selection), customer service (e.g., social media, return policies), order fulfillment (e.g., process transparency, timeliness of delivery), and security/privacy. We discuss this conceptual model of MSQ which will be used to develop a comprehensive MSQ measurement in further research.

Questions asked by mobile users are strongly influenced by contextual factors such as location, conversation and activity. We report on a diary study performed to better understand mobile information needs. We find that the type of questions recorded by participants varies across their locations, with differences between home, shopping and in-car contexts. These variations occur both in the query terms and in the form of desired answers. Both the location of queries and the participants' activities affected participants' questions. When information needs were affected by both location and activity, they tended to be strongly affected by both factors. The overall picture that emerges is one of multiple contextual influences interacting to shape mobile information needs. Mobile devices that attempt to adapt to users' context will need to account for a rich variety of situational factors.	diary studies;information needs;interaction;mobile device	Annika Hinze;Carole Chang;David M.

Not much is known about how these users think about controlling access to this data. To better understand this, we conducted semi-structured, in-situ interviews with 33 users in 15 households. We found that users create ad-hoc access-control mechanisms that do not always work; that their ideal policies are complex and multi-dimensional; that a priori policy specification is often insufficient; and that people's mental models of access control and security are often misaligned with current systems. We detail these findings and present a set of associated guidelines for designing usable access-control systems for the home environment.	access control;control system;digital recording;hoc (programming language);mental model;semiconductor industry	Michelle L.

1e440726caef6c210a69c7b05c3e794f2cbad986	intelligent home assistant use in the home environment		Individuals increasingly acquire Intelligent Home Assistants (IHAs), with products being offered by some of the largest technology companies in the industry such as Amazon (e.g. Amazon Echo) and Google (e.g. Google Home). Their business model is designed to capitalize on having as much data about customers as possible. These companies do so by providing products that customers will view as providing a benefit that outweighs the cost of giving up this personal information. IHAs work by continuously listening for commands they need to respond to (also known as “wake words” such as Alexa, Computer or other userdefined wake words). As this ecosystem continues to develop, the functionality of IHAs inside the home has grown, increasing benefits to the consumer. In order for this functionality to be provided however, these devices are connected to the cloud and the data they receive is recorded by the provider. The real-time recording of this information and the increased use of IHAs in households raise the question about how invasive families find them to be. However, little empirical research exists on the social uses of these devices and the implications of interactions with them. Therefore, this research explores the role IHAs have on individuals’ perceptions of risk, trust, and privacy using multi-level research to understand how these perceptions influence families’ use of the devices. IHAs allow information retrieval (e.g. performing Internet searches, weather updates and making restaurant reservations online, via voice-activated assistants such as Alexa for Amazon Echo or Google Assistant for Google Home), sensing and collecting of data from other devices around the home or worn by the occupants (e.g. data from the motion and door sensors or wearable devices such as Android Wear watch), and command and control (e.g. turning on and off connected devices in the home, such as televisions). Generally, audio and multimedia (e.g. images and videos) materials and other data are also collected and stored locally on the IHAs and/or other devices such as mobile devices used to connect to the IHAs. Such data can be used to profile the home occupants. To explore potential issues resulting from this “whole family profiling”, we seek to answer the research questions posed below. In doing so, we hope to provide insight to the research community on the privacy implications that IHA use has on individuals and families. RQ 1: What factors influence individuals’ use of IHAs? RQ 2: What role do family-related factors have on individuals’ use of IHAs? In this paper, we propose utilizing the APCO model to study the multi-level nature of the individual within the family-unit and how privacy concerns interplay with trust and risk perceptions to determine people's behavioral outcomes of willingness to share information and IHA use. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) is proposed to test the research model. We expect to contribute to research by demonstrating the role privacy plays at the group (family) level of analysis, as well as how the many nuanced natures of trust influence the behaviors of individuals in the family environment. In particular, it will be interesting to uncover how trust in the ecosystem of the IHA interacts with trust of various members of the family, and how this affects individuals’ vs. families’ usage of the IHA. For practitioners, this research has the potential to inform future developments of IHAs in such a way to overcome any barriers to adoption driven by privacy concerns and issues of trust.	android wear;cloud computing;ecosystem;expect;google assistant;home automation;information retrieval;intel hub architecture;interaction;mobile device;multilevel model;personally identifiable information;privacy;profiling (computer programming);real-time clock;sensor;speaker recognition;television;viavoice;wearable technology	Robert E.

Pokemon Go accesses several functionalities of the smartphone and, in turn, collects a plethora of data of its users. For assessing the privacy concerns, we conduct an online study in Germany with 683 users of the game. The results indicate that the majority of the active players are concerned about the privacy practices of companies. This result hints towards the existence of a cognitive dissonance, i.e. the privacy paradox. Since this result is common in the privacy literature, we complement the first study with a second one with 199 users, which aims to assess the behavior of users with regard to which measures they undertake for protecting their privacy. The results are highly mixed and dependent on the measure, i.e. relatively many participants use privacy-preserving measures when interacting with their smartphone. This implies that many users know about risks and might take actions to protect their privacy, but deliberately trade-off their information privacy for the utility generated by playing the game.

b16a38acbd861c4062d5312f7fb22fbb7c3677c5	end-user development in social psychology research: factors for adoption		Psychology researchers employ the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to capture thoughts and behaviours of participants within their everyday lives. Smartphone-based ESM apps are increasingly used in such research. However, the diversity of researchers' app requirements, coupled with cost and complexity of their implementation, has prompted end-user development (EUD) approaches. In addition, limited evaluation of such environments beyond lab-based usability studies precludes discovery of factors pertaining to real-world EUD adoption. We first describe the extension of Jeeves, our visual programming environment for ESM app creation, in which we implemented additional functional requirements, derived from a survey and analysis of previous work. We further describe interviews with psychology researchers to understand their practical considerations for employing this extended environment in their work practices. Results of our analysis are presented as factors pertaining to the adoption of EUD activities within and between communities of practice.	append;computer scientist;end-user development;functional requirement;integrated development environment;smartphone;software requirements;usability;visual programming language	Daniel Rough;Aaron Quigley	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)	10.1109/VLHCC.2018.8506573	human–computer interaction;visualization;end-user development;functional requirement;visual programming language;experience sampling method;usability;computer science	SE	-61.17109516912085	-44.71201836898188	189908

To gain new insights into young adult's self-esteem problems and how we might help support them with interactive technologies, we conducted a mixed method user-centred study. We used a 6-week cultural probe study with 11 young adults, including a focus group, to understand current practices in managing self-esteem with everyday technologies. We then co-designed interactive digital artefacts for helping improve self-esteem, to deploy as technology probes with 6 young adults for four weeks.  Our contribution is two-fold. Firstly, we present the Self-Esteem Technology Support (SETS) framework for informing design of interactive technologies supporting young adults in managing low self-esteem. Secondly, we propose that interactive technologies designed to help young people feel happier need to be flexible, adaptable, private, available, personalisable, and have an engaging form factor to inspire feelings of fondness toward having the device as part of their daily routines.

In this paper we present an industrial case in which a """"live"""" prototyping approach was trialled during the development of a new programmable radiator thermostat. A live prototype is an interactive prototype that permits real-time modifications to its interactivity within a collaborative session. We analyse collaborative events that were staged around a live prototype in order to demonstrate the ways in which the prototype worked as a platform for various stakeholders to participate in design, Practical benefits for development included the rapidity with which separate design iterations could be implemented in plenum and the ease with which changes to the interface could be rolled back when unforeseen difficulties were encountered. The live prototype also exposed latent issues in the complex organisation of an industrial design undertaking, including misalignments between stakeholders, institutional design constraints, and implicit design rationale. Additionally, by being modifiable and easily shareable, it also served as a physical form of documentation of the current state of the interface to other stakeholders. As an approach, live prototyping opened up the possibilities, constraints and organisational contexts of prototyping to stakeholders."""	design rationale;documentation;interaction design;interactivity;iteration;iterative compression;prototype;real-time transcription;satellite data unit;unintended consequences;windows live	Willem Horst;Ben Matthews	2016		10.1145/2901790.2901807	co-design;simulation;design methods;human–computer interaction;systems engineering;engineering;operating system;prototype;mechanical engineering	HCI	-62.217325707061846	-38.35267870560864	190310

We study this relationship in the context of an art installation that concerns the water cycle in nature. The research question is: How can we design and evaluate software that becomes a medium to engage and inform the user? We have gathered empirical data during a two days exhibition of two versions of a pervasive art installation by: observations, questionnaires, and input logs. Data analysis reveals that the art installation engaged users, with focus on young children, and communicated the intended message. The results are organized according to five important factors for developing and evaluating interacting art installations. These are: 1) data collection method; 2) user interaction; 3) social interaction; 4) issues about children; 5) message comprehension. We suggest that these factors can inform engineering practices for engaging software like video-games.	interaction;interactivity;list comprehension;open-source software;pervasive informatics;self-replicating machine;touchscreen	Mia Aasbakken;Maria Letizia Jaccheri;Konstantinos Chorianopoulos	2012	2012 Second International Workshop on Games and Software Engineering: Realizing User Engagement with Game Engineering Techniques (GAS)		human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-56.88226274591415	-44.702828777483695	191083

In this paper, we argue that the appropriation and adaptation of groupware and other types of advanced CSCW technologies is basically a problem of sensemaking. We analyze how a group of “technology-use mediators” (Orlikowski etÂ al. Org. Sci. (1995) 6(4), 423) in a large, multinational company adapted a groupware technology (a “virtual workspace”) to the local organizational context (and vice versa) by modifying features of the technology, providing ongoing support for users, and promoting appropriate conventions of use. Our findings corroborate earlier research on technology-use mediation, which suggests that such mediators can exert considerable influence on how a particular technology will be established and used in an organization. However, we also find that the process of technology-use mediation is much more complex and indeterminate than prior research suggests. The reason being, we argue, that new, advanced CSCW technologies, such as “virtual workspaces” and other groupware applications, challenge the mediators’ and users’ sensemaking, because the technologies are equivocal and, therefore, open to many possible and plausible interpretations.	collaborative software;computer-supported cooperative work;contingency (philosophy);degree (graph theory);field research;humans;human–computer interaction;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;jean;nonlinear gameplay;pors;power management unit;sensemaking;situated;social support;upload;workspace	Jorgen P.

Researchers in the field of Persuasive Technologies have contributed significant theories intended to guide software developers. Yet due to the comprehensive nature of these theories as well as their recency, many aspects have not been studied— especially aspects that require integration of multiple theoretical perspectives. This paper applies a design science research approach to develop a sleep health app for use by college students. We use this setting to demonstrate how requirements gathered via a key informant focus group and formative user testing can be mapped to both persuasive system design and behavior change support system theories with the result of producing clear guidance for subsequent app design and assessment.	focus group;requirement;software developer;software development;systems design;theory;usability testing;user research	E.

When making or evaluating emergency response plans for a large city, professionals from police, fire, civil defense, health, environment, transportation, and social services departments meet and discuss. As emergency management involves coordinated activities of various stakeholders, all participants desire to have visual representation of location-sensitive data on a common, integrated display. Separate displays for different types of data cause semantic fragmentation; as one's eyes switch between displays to associate related information, mental transformation in cognitive psychology has to take place, reducing an individual's performance on the task. Moreover, separate personal displays create a feeling of isolation from others and hinders face-to-face communication.	fragmentation (computing);modulation;multi-user;viewport	Guangtao Zhai;Xiaolin Wu	2014	IEEE Signal Processing Magazine	10.1109/MSP.2014.2328506	simulation;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-62.04945436485324	-39.909872846709845	194307

They must also continue to behave securely. Positive outcomes of secure behavior may encourage the continuance of that behavior, whereas negative outcomes may lead users to adopt less-secure behaviors. For example, in the context of authentication, login success rates may determine whether users continue to use a strong credential or switch to less secure behaviors (e.g., storing a credential or changing to a weaker, albeit easier to successfully enter, credential). Authentication is a particularly interesting security behavior for information systems researchers to study because it is affected by an IT artifact (the design of the user interface). Laptops and desktop computers use full-size physical keyboards. However, users are increasingly adopting mobile devices, which provide either miniature physical keypads or touchscreens for entering authentication credentials.

In a quantitative analysis of data from Change.org, one of the largest online e-petition platforms, we test and find support for both theories. A follow-up qualitative analysis shows that not only do users learn from their experience, systems also """"learn"""" from users to make better recommendations.

To propose effective ways of providing a more positive IoT user experience, this study examined the effects of identity extension (user identity being extended onto an IoT device vs. not being extended) and the type of framing (hedonic vs. utilitarian) of messages delivered via the device. Preliminary data from a between-subjects experiment (N = 22) revealed that identity extension induced greater attachment and satisfaction with regard to the device and resulted in the experience of greater feelings of social presence. In addition, the results indicated that the effect of identity extension on satisfaction and social presence was mediated by user attachment to the device. The implications of the key findings are discussed.	attachments;framing (world wide web);internet of things;programming paradigm;smart objects;social presence theory;user experience	Hoyoun Cho;Seyoung Park;Seongmi Jeong;Ki Joon Kim;Dong-Hee Shin;Hyup Kim	2015		10.1145/2800835.2800891	human–computer interaction;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things	HCI	-58.97725332230133	-44.28594885670995	198444

A major aim of the project was to shift away from ‘technology-push' and ‘problem-focused' approaches to user-driven approaches and map out an AAL system that will provide practical benefits for users in their everyday lives. The SOPRANO project involved users at all stages in the iterative development of an AAL system. This paper presents the main findings from the study, reflects on the key challenges in adopting a user-centred approach, and identifies some of the barriers to the widespread implementation of AAL systems within the spectrum of care for older people.	living systems	Ryan Woolrych;Andrew Sixsmith	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30779-9_1	simulation;human–computer interaction;multimedia	Robotics	-62.72484027409021	-44.117046122019445	198454

ee8856e844591ecfe672feda0f68708ac12f22e5	cross-modal collaborative information seeking (ccis): an exploratory study	cross modal interaction;accessibility;web search;collaborative information seeking	Most previous studies of users with visual impairments access the web have focused solely on human-web interaction. This study explores the under investigated area of cross-modal collaborative information seeking (CCIS), that is the challenges and opportunities that exist in supporting visually impaired users to take an effective part in collaborative web search tasks with sighted peers. We observed behaviour patterns that occurred in CCIS activities between 8 pairs of visually impaired and sighted users in both co-located and distributed settings. Our findings showed the influence of the different interaction modalities employed, as well as differences due to whether pairs were working together co-located or distributed from one another. The effects of these factors were most clearly seen in the way pairs opted to divide the labour involved in search tasks, and the way in which they provided and used awareness information. Asymmetric division of labour strategies were employed to try to overcome the challenges imposed by accessibility issues and the use of different interaction modalities. We also observed that participants expended unnecessary effort in supplying more awareness information than was needed in an attempt to compensate for the absence of a tool to support cross-modal awareness information exchange.	accessibility;collaborative information seeking;information exchange;modal logic;web search engine	Dena Al-Thani;Tony Stockman;Anastasios Tombros	2013			engineering;knowledge management;multimedia;communication	HCI	-59.53798927011625	-41.90536833475828	199224

User experience of mobile apps is generally good, but rather unsatisfying for people with disabilities relying on accessibility support. Developers often are not aware of and do not respect this user group. We propose a system supporting developers in early stages of app development. The Accapto toolkit allows modelling accessible smartphone interaction during the design phase. Based on this interaction model the prototype of the resulting app is generated. Predefined accessibility features based on standards and expert knowledge are automatically integrated to enhance accessibility.	app protein, human;accessibility;disabled persons;mobile app;prototype;smartphone;user experience;standards characteristics	Elmar Krainz;Klaus Miesenberger	2017	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-798-6-660	human–computer interaction;multimedia;computer science	HCI	-56.59814209330332	-44.54306491599532	199674

Critical to the design process is to understand and manage the expectations of stakeholders (including funders, research partners and end users) for these systems. In particular, the way in which expectations impact upon technology development choices between small-scale, ‘high tech’ innovations or larger scalable solutions. This paper describes the differences in a revolutionary design process (for ‘high tech’ prototypes or catwalk technologies) versus an evolutionary design process (for scalable or prêt-a-porter systems), as exemplified in two location-based mobile interaction case studies. One case study exemplifies a revolutionary design process and resultant system, and the other an evolutionary design process and system. The use of these case studies is a clear natural progression from the paper that first described the concept of ‘catwalk technologies’ (Adams et al, 2013), which itself drew upon research that used mobile devices for outdoor ‘in the wild’ locations. This paper presents a set list of fifteen heuristic guidelines based upon an analysis of these case studies. These heuristics present characteristics and key differences between the two types of design process. This paper provides a key reference point for researchers, developers and the academic community as a whole, when defining a project rationale for designing and developing technical systems. In addition, we refer to the role of the researcher/research team in terms of guiding and managing stakeholder and research team expectations and how this relates to the planning and deployment of catwalk or prêt-à-porter technologies. Lastly, we state how this research has vital implications for planning and enacting interventions and sequences of interactions with stakeholders and, crucially, in the planning of future research projects.
