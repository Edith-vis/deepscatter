4aa7b5232c5bac279b2b7f1e89e8538b00807775	survey: intrusion detection systems in encrypted traffic		Intrusion detection system, IDS, traditionally inspects the payload information of packets. This approach is not valid in encrypted traffic as the payload information is not available. There are two approaches, with different detection capabilities, to overcome the challenges of encryption: traffic decryption or traffic analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the research related to the IDSs in encrypted traffic. The focus is on traffic analysis, which does not need traffic decryption. One of the major limitations of the surveyed researches is that most of them are concentrating in detecting the same limited type of attacks, such as brute force or scanning attacks. Both the security enhancements to be derived from using the IDS and the security challenges introduced by the encrypted traffic are discussed. By categorizing the existing work, a set of conclusions and proposals for future research directions are presented.	intrusion detection system	Tiina Kovanen;Gil David;Timo Hämäläinen	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46301-8_23	internet privacy;computer security	Security	-58.55778051312357	65.8914367220533	182505

0a566d788145cffeec3e0742d3485c82b8564013	a reexamination of internationalized domain names: the good, the bad and the ugly		Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are domain names containing non-ASCII characters. Despite its installation in DNS for more than 15 years, little has been done to understand how this initiative was developed and its security implications. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by studying the IDN ecosystem and cyber-attacks abusing IDN. In particular, we performed by far the most comprehensive measurement study using IDNs discovered from 56 TLD zone files. Through correlating data from auxiliary sources like WHOIS, passive DNS and URL blacklists, we gained many insights. Our discoveries are multi-faceted. On one hand, 1.4 million IDNs were actively registered under over 700 registrars, and regions within east Asia have seen prominent development in IDN registration. On the other hand, most of the registrations were opportunistic: they are currently not associated with meaningful websites and they have severe configuration issues (e.g., shared SSL certificates). What is more concerning is the rising trend of IDN abuse. So far, more than 6K IDNs were determined as malicious by URL blacklists and we also identified 1,516 and 1,497 IDNs showing high visual and semantic similarity to reputable brand domains (e.g., apple.com). Meanwhile, brand owners have only registered a few of these domains. Our study suggests the development of IDN needs to be re-examined. New solutions and proposals are needed to address issues like its inadequate usage and new attack surfaces.	ecosystem;faceted classification;internationalized domain name;malware;public key certificate;semantic similarity	Baojun Liu;Chaoyi Lu;Zhou Li;Ying Liu;Hai-Xin Duan;Shuang Hao;Zaifeng Zhang	2018	2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)	10.1109/DSN.2018.00072	form of the good;computer science;world wide web;blacklisting;distributed computing;the internet;semantics;semantic similarity;zone file	Metrics	-55.97791254957814	62.40968944913845	183014

b4693790ceb9532e83525f16829358ad774dddbb	pulsar: stateful black-box fuzzing of proprietary network protocols		The security of network services and their protocols critically depends on minimizing their attack surface. A single flaw in an implementation can suffice to compromise a service and expose sensitive data to an attacker. The discovery of vulnerabilities in protocol implementations, however, is a challenging task: While for standard protocols this process can be conducted with regular techniques for auditing, the situation becomes difficult for proprietary protocols if neither the program code nor the specification of the protocol are easily accessible. As a result, vulnerabilities in closed-source implementations can often remain undiscovered for a longer period of time. In this paper, we present PULSAR, a method for stateful black-box fuzzing of proprietary network protocols. Our method combines concepts from fuzz testing with techniques for automatic protocol reverse engineering and simulation. It proceeds by observing the traffic of a proprietary protocol and inferring a generative model for message formats and protocol states that can not only analyze but also simulate communication. During fuzzing this simulation can effectively explore the protocol state space and thereby enables uncovering vulnerabilities deep inside the protocol implementation. We demonstrate the efficacy of PULSAR in two case studies, where it identifies known as well as unknown vulnerabilities.	attack surface;binary protocol;black box;communications protocol;computer security;control system;devil;embedded system;flaw hypothesis methodology;generative model;proprietary protocol;rs-232;reverse engineering;simulation;software bug;state (computer science);state space;stateful firewall;text-based (computing);tracing (software);vulnerability (computing)	Hugo Gascon;Christian Wressnegger;Fabian Yamaguchi;Daniel Arp;Konrad Rieck	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-28865-9_18	astronomy	Security	-59.698122180220594	65.19916160273782	183858
df3b6e772ea9d2a53198c4d5bcd6da01c59d24b9	bigmomal: big data analytics for mobile malware detection		Mobile malware is on the rise. Indeed, due to their popularity, smartphones represent an attractive target for cybercriminals, especially because of private user data, as these devices incorporate a lot of sensitive information about users, even more than a personal computer. As a matter of fact, besides personal information such as documents, accounts, passwords, and contacts, smartphone sensors centralise other sensitive data including user location and physical activities. In this paper, we study the problem of malware detection in smartphones, relying on supervised-machine-learning models and big-data analytics frameworks. Using the SherLock dataset, a large, publicly available dataset for smartphone-data analysis, we train and benchmark tree-based models to identify running applications and to detect malware activity. We verify their accuracy, and initial results suggest that decision trees are capable of identifying running apps and malware activity with high accuracy.	benchmark (computing);big data;cybercrime;decision tree;information sensitivity;mobile malware;password;personal computer;personally identifiable information;sensor;smartphone	Sarah Wassermann;Pedro Casas	2018		10.1145/3229598.3229600	clustering high-dimensional data;computer science;mobile malware;network security;big data;information sensitivity;malware;internet privacy;personally identifiable information;analytics	Security	-57.402507553473825	61.54042431910817	184165

We present a methodology for inferring the phylogeny, or evolutionary tree, of such exploits. We have applied this methodology to traffic captured at several vantage points, and we demonstrate that our methodology is robust to the observed polymorphism. Our techniques revealed non-trivial code sharing among different exploit families, and the resulting phylogenies accurately captured the subtle variations among exploits within each family. Thus, we believe our methodology and results are a helpful step to better understanding the evolution of remote code injection exploits on the Internet.	code injection;emergence;internet;malware;network address translation;observable;phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;scientific literature;traverse;tracing (software)	Justin Ma;John Dunagan;Helen J.

cd21542c48012e053ec44d4c56d43108a64c196e	employing proxy services	internet protocol	INTRODUCTION As the use of the TCP/IP protocol suite expanded during the 1990s in tandem with the growth in the use of the Internet, organizations began to realize a new security threat emerging as their networks were connected to the Internet. As academic, government, and commercial networks were connected to the Internet, they became subject to attack from literally an unlimited number of computer users located throughout the world. Although router access-lists provide a mechanism to enable or disable the flow of packets through router ports, based on source and destination IP address and the type of application data expressed in the form of a port number, organizations began to realize that by themselves router access-lists were not a sufficient barrier to prevent many types of undesirable operations against hosts residing behind a router. One solution developed to provide a higher level of security to organizational networks was the use of a firewall with proxy service capability located behind the router — which is the focus of this article. This article will first review the operation of router access-lists and some of their limitations. Using this information as a base, a description and discussion of the operation of different types of firewall proxy services and how they can be used to obtain an enhanced level of network protection will follow.	firewall (computing);internet protocol suite;protocol stack;proxy server;router (computing);user (computing)	Gilbert Held	1999	Information Systems Security	10.1201/1086/43305.8.2.19990601/31058.2	internet protocol;core router;provider edge;bogon filtering;the internet;niprnet;internet layer;computer science;internet security;forwarding plane;internet control message protocol;port control protocol;multihoming;one-armed router;default gateway;world wide web;computer security;virtual router redundancy protocol;computer network	Security	-56.536329090379695	67.13250216230333	184287

This fact makes the Internet vulnerable to attacks: complete networks can be hijacked to blackhole or intercept traffic. In this work, we extend the set of known hijacking attacks with a real case study on AS hijacking, carried out in order to send spam from a victim's network. This type of attack is more sophisticated than common IP prefix hijacking, and is aimed at a long-term benefit, with effective use for several months. On our poster, we thoroughly investigate the aforementioned incident based on live data from both the control and the data plane. Our analysis yields insights into the attacker's proceeding to covertly hijack a whole autonomous system, mislead an upstream provider and abuse an unallocated address space. We further discuss the potential for prevention and reveal shortcomings of state of the art BGP security extensions like RPKI. Based on these findings, we outline the concept of an early warning system for AS hijacking with pre-emptive capabilities.	address space;autonomous system (internet);blackhole exploit kit;border gateway protocol;forwarding plane;resource public key infrastructure;spamming;visual intercept	Johann Schlamp;Georg Carle;Ernst W.

e3af87cbe67a0602137eea870b93e144a96b6a6e	taxonomy on malware evasion countermeasures techniques		One of the major threats on the Internet is Malware — malicious software which intends to harm IT infrastructures and systems. In the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT), the public attention has been particularly drawn to the growing number of malware programs targeting IoT devices and related security in the recent years. Increasingly the malware, being polymorphic or metamorphic, changes behavior or remains inactive until a specific environment changes. These behaviors are the malware's detection evasion techniques to avoid detection and capture. Such highly evasive malicious programs are on the rise, resulting in extensive research efforts needed on evasion countermeasures. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and useful taxonomy to classify the existing countermeasures. This work fills the gap by presenting a survey on available malware evasion countermeasures from both academia and industry. Our main goal of proposing this taxonomy is, help to build a scalable classification of evasion countermeasures which will support malware analysis and classification as well as to guide the design of future evasion countermeasures.	countermeasure (computer);evasion (network security);evolutionary taxonomy;internet;malware analysis;scalability;taxonomy (general)	Chandra Sekar Veerappan;Peter Kok Keong Loh;Zhaohui Tang;Forest Tan	2018	2018 IEEE 4th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)	10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355202	computer security;malware;the internet;virtual machining;scalability;computer science;malware analysis;countermeasure;internet of things	Security	-59.68393439062497	60.73095627329235	184641

Normally users exhibit some regularity in their behavior such as command usage. We propose a new approach to mine user command associations. Since each user may have different usage behavior, using the built behavior pattern to predict a masquerader’s next command will result in low success rate. We devise an algorithm to identify masqueraders by evaluating the accuracy of the predictions. Furthermore our detection method can be used in real-time without having to wait for a log of a large number of commands. Experimental results show that the association rules mining performs very well in detecting masqueraders.	algorithm;association rule learning;authorization;real-time clock;sensor	Han-Ching Wu;Shou-Hsuan Stephen Huang	2009	2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2009.38	association rule learning;computer science;network security;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security	Robotics	-61.45310393442818	63.35443721182097	184918

However, it is not possible to defend from all possible attacks for cost and performance reasons. An attack ranking is thus necessary. We propose a simulative framework that makes it possible to rank attacks according to their impact. We also describe a case study to assert its usefulness and effectiveness.	autonomous system (internet);cyber-physical system;simulation;software deployment	Gianluca Dini;Marco Tiloca	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13823-7_8	simulation;engineering;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-58.4708606427365	63.947536140147335	185266
cc995c369cda9ea8e1cca4dcb4722dc923b33755	application of visual analysis to detect and analyze patterns in voip attack traffic		"""Voice over IP (VoIP) based on SIP is rapidly replacing classical telephony services as providers worldwide migrate their services to IP-based platforms. However, apart from the benefits for providers and customers, telephony is becoming """"just another"""" Internet application which is vulnerable to multiple - both well known and novel - attack and misuse scenarios. We focus in this paper on the attempts to compromise SIP accounts in order to misuse them at the expense of the legitimate owner (Toll-Fraud). Such misuse occurs globally and massively and caused significant damage already. Our study is based on real SIP attack data collected over several years and our long standing expertise in analyzing this data by using standard methods. We show in this paper, that the visual analytics approach by using a node-link visualization diagram tool can provide new insights into attacker behavior, particularly with respect to distributed and coordinated attacks from different sources and specific properties of different popular attack tools. This analysis also revealed the usage of SIP INVITE packets for previously not known purposes in multi-stage attacks. Therefore, this approach provides a valuable and useful addition to the approaches used so far, which are based on statistical analysis or rule-based clustering."""	attack patterns;botnet;cluster analysis;diagram;gephi;invitation system;logic programming;misuse case;rich internet application;rule 110;rule 90;sensor;server (computing);telephone number;visual analytics	Ekaterina Volodina;Adnan Aziz;Erwin P.

efe35a6b64df2585ea88271ef715608df5ada56c	risks of monoculture		"""T he W32/Blaster worm burst onto the Internet scene in August of 2003. By exploiting a buffer overflow in Windows, the worm was able to infect more than 1.4 million systems worldwide in less than a month. More diversity in the OS market would have limited the number of susceptible systems, thereby reducing the level of infection. An analogy with biological systems is irresistible. When a disease strikes a biological system, a significant percentage of the affected population will survive, largely due to its genetic diversity. This holds true even for previously unknown diseases. By analogy , diverse computing systems should weather cyber attacks better than systems that tend toward mono-culture. But how valid is the analogy? It could be argued that the case for computing diversity is even stronger than the case for biological diversity. In biological systems, attackers find their targets at random, while in computing systems, monoculture creates more incentive for attack because the results will be all the more spectacular. On the other hand, it might be argued that cyber-monoculture has arisen via natural selection—providers with the best security products have survived to dominate the market. Given the dismal state of computer security today, this argument is not particularly persuasive. Although cyber-diversity evidently provides security benefits, why do we live in an era of relative computing monoculture? The first-to-market advantage and the ready availability of support for popular products are examples of incentives that work against diversity. The net result is a """" tragedy of the (security) commons """" phenomenon—the security of the Internet as a whole could benefit from increased diversity, but individuals have incentives for monoculture. It is unclear how proposals aimed at improving computing security might affect cyber-diversity. For example , increased liability for software providers is often suggested as a market-oriented approach to improved security. However, such an approach might favor those with the deepest pockets, leading to less diversity. Although some cyber-diversity is good, is more diversity better? Virus writers in particular have used diversity to their advantage; polymorphic viruses are currently in vogue. Such viruses are generally encrypted with a weak cipher, using a new key each time the virus propagates, thus confounding signature-based detection. However, because the decryption routine cannot be encrypted, detection is still possible. Virus writers are on the verge of unleashing so-called metamorphic viruses, where the body of the virus itself changes each time it propagates. …"""	biological system;buffer overflow;cipher;computer security;computer virus;cryptography;encryption;microsoft windows;monoculture (computer science);operating system;the verge;turing reduction	Mark Stamp	2004	Commun.

MySpace and Facebook, two leading online SN sites, have a combined user base of 170 million as of 2008. SN sites started to offer developers open platforms that provide users’ profile information to the developers. Unfortunately, the applications can also be used to invade privacy and to harvest the users’ profile information without their acknowledgement. To address this vulnerability, we propose a privacy-management system that protects the accessibility of users’ profile. The system uses probabilistic approach based on information revelation of users. Our experimental result shows that the system can achieve high accuracy rate of 75%.	accessibility;error-tolerant design;experience;information harvesting;internet;open platform;personally identifiable information;privacy;social network;virtual world	Enkh-Amgalan Baatarjav;Ram Dantu;Santi Phithakkitnukoon	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-89862-7_23	information privacy;computer science;management system;sociology of the internet;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;social network	Web+IR	-56.12241259456697	62.65354305904676	186329

Although phishers have great flexibility in manipulating both the content and structure of phishing emails, phishers have much less flexibility in completely concealing the sender information of a phishing message. Importantly, such sender information is often inconsistent with the target institution of a phishing email. Based on this observation, in this paper we advocate and develop a sender-centric approach to detecting phishing emails by focusing on the sender information of a message instead of the content or structure of the message. Our evaluation studies based on real-world email traces show that the sender-centric approach is a feasible and effective method in detecting phishing emails. For example, using an email trace containing both phishing and legitimate messages, we show that the sender-centric approach can detect 98.7% of phishing emails while correctly classifying all legitimate messages.	effective method;email;internet;phishing;sensor;tracing (software)	Fernando Sanchez;Zhenhai Duan	2012	2012 International Conference on Cyber Security	10.1109/CyberSecurity.2012.11	phishing;spoofed url;email spoofing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;email authentication;domainkeys identified mail	Web+IR	-57.75946347895446	64.07537677227069	186537

We demonstrate that in each case huge numbers of Websites may be known to others, but the company with the take-down contract remains unaware of them, or only belatedly learns that they exist. We monitored all of the Websites to determine when they were removed and calculate the resultant increase in lifetimes from the take-down company not knowing that they should act. The results categorically demonstrate that significant amounts of money are being put at risk by the failure to share proprietary feeds of URLs. We analyse the incentives that prevent data sharing by take-down companies, contrasting this with the anti-virus industry - where sharing prevails - and with schemes for purchasing vulnerability information, where information about attacks is kept proprietary. We conclude by recommending that the defenders of phishing attacks start cooperatively sharing all of their data about phishing URLs with each other.	antivirus software;money;phishing;purchasing;resultant;the fight: lights out	Tyler Moore;Richard Clayton	2008	2008 eCrime Researchers Summit	10.1109/ECRIME.2008.4696968	business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-57.56323683385143	63.713271072533026	186800

Honeypots are useful for providing valuable insights into potential system security loopholes. The current research investigated the effectiveness of the use of centralized system management technologies called Puppet and Virtual Machines in the implementation automated honeypots for intrusion detection, correction and prevention. A centralized logging system was used to collect information of the source address, country and timestamp of intrusions by attackers. The unique contributions of this research include: a demonstration how open source technologies is used to dynamically add or modify hacking incidences in a high-interaction honeynet system; a presentation of strategies for making honeypots more attractive for hackers to spend more time to provide hacking evidences; and an exhibition of algorithms for system and network intrusion prevention.	algorithm;centralized computing;honeynet project;honeypot (computing);information system;intrusion detection system;open-source software;real-time transcription;systems management	Amos O.

2bbe7a6ef6d828002c31d02f7d6fbab0fc36caa9	an eye on network intruder-administrator shootouts	misuse detection;resource availability	Carefully logging network activity is essential to meet the requirements of high security and optimal resource availability. However, detecting break-in attempts within this activity is a difficult task. Making the distinction between misuse and normal use is hard, and identifying intrusions that use novel attacks is fundamentally difficult. In this paper, we introduce a visual approach for analyzing network activity. This approach differs from anomaly and misuse detection because it considers human factors to support the exploration of network traffic. Our prototype application is based on an unsupervised neural network and consequently does not rely on any prior knowledge of the data being analyzed. We use self-organizing maps to project the network events on a space appropriate for visualization, and achieve their exploration using a map metaphor. The approach we present can be used to analyze past and present activities, as well as to show trends in the events. To demonstrate the usability of our tools, we describe the investigation of a dataset containing common intrusion patterns. We also discuss some weaknesses of current intrusion detection systems and propose a new paradigm for monitoring network activity that enables the discovery of new, sophisticated, and structured attacks.	aline systems;anomaly detection;artificial neural network;human factors and ergonomics;intrusion detection system;jones calculus;misuse detection;network traffic control;organizing (structure);programming paradigm;prototype;requirement;self-organization;self-organizing map;sensor;usability;visual paradigm for uml;wendy kellogg	Luc Girardin	1999			anomaly-based intrusion detection system;simulation;engineering;data mining;computer security	Security	-61.59623108729552	62.42199031126623	186951
eb1932185495671f9bd703fa1547420851ac23a3	zoe: content-based anomaly detection for industrial control systems		Due its complexity and a multitude of proprietary components, industrial control systems are an immanently difficult field of application for intrusion detection. Proprietary binary protocols and the lack of public specifications have forced the research community to move away from content-based detection to more abstract concepts. In this paper, we show that in contrast to prior belief the content of unknown binary protocols can very well be modeled. ZOE derives prototype models that are specific to individual types of messages in order to capture the characteristics of arbitrary binary protocols and enable detecting different forms of attacks as anomalies. In an evaluation based on 6 days of network traffic recorded at a large power plant (1,900 MW) with over 92,000 unique devices, we demonstrate that ZOE improves upon related approaches by up to an order of magnitude in detection performance, but also significantly decreases false positives.	alpha compositing;anomaly detection;binary protocol;communications protocol;control system;grams;intrusion detection system;microwave;n-gram;network packet;network traffic control;prototype;sensor;text-based (computing)	Christian Wressnegger;Ansgar Kellner;Konrad Rieck	2018	2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)	10.1109/DSN.2018.00025	anomaly detection;data modeling;real-time computing;computer science;industrial control system;order of magnitude;distributed computing;intrusion detection system;binary number;false positive paradox	Mobile	-59.86200102135988	65.11612177572651	187108

To systematically understand the potential capability of attackers, we investigate the feasibility of using domain name service (DNS) as a stealthy botnet command-and-control channel. We describe and quantitatively analyze several techniques that can be used to effectively hide malicious DNS activities at the network level. Our experimental evaluation makes use of a two-month-long 4.6-GB campus network data set and 1 million domain names obtained from >alexa.com. We conclude that the DNS-based stealthy command-and-control channel (in particular, the codeword mode) can be very powerful for attackers, showing the need for further research by defenders in this direction. The statistical analysis of DNS payload as a countermeasure has practical limitations inhibiting its large-scale deployment.	algorithm;anomaly detection;authorization;botnet;causal filter;code word;directory service;email;entity;malware;open research;operating system;rogue;sensor;social network;software deployment;tunneling protocol	Kui Xu;Patrick Butler;Sudip Saha;Danfeng Yao	2013	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2013.10	dns hijacking;communications protocol;payload;computer science;network security;operating system;quantum tunnelling;internet privacy;computer security;server;computer network	Security	-59.595995536965326	65.47451891426076	187640
55a91a03abff7518ab4a5c78f3518758cd587171	using clustering to detect chinese censorware	chinese censorware	The Chinese government restricts access to religious, political, and pornographic content through the use of an intricate system of surveillance and censorship infrastructure. This infrastructure creates patterns that seem anomalous when compared to normal Chinese Internet traffic. Previous detection methods could neither detect zero-day attacks nor lower false-positives without first observing the attack and, later, collecting a large amount of training data. By using clustering, a technique from machine learning, fast detection of forged packets from Chinese government censorware becomes tractable. These new techniques expose previously hidden examples of sophisticated man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and the algorithms used in these attacks. This paper provides both a methodology for using anomaly detection algorithms on Chinese censorware as well as examples of detected patterns. We provide circumvention strategies through the lens of exploiting computational complexity bottlenecks intrinsic to infrastructure required to censor the Internet for 250 million users. Lastly, approaches for building detectors for enterprise and civilian networks, like the power-grid, are discussed.	algorithm;anomaly detection;censoring (statistics);cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;content-control software;machine learning;man-in-the-middle attack;sensor	Becker Polverini;William M.

6c5f99b89ec721cf3db8c5d060e0ebf7fcd3e0ab	cyber security via signaling games: toward a science of cyber security		In March of 2013, what started as a minor dispute between Spamhaus and Cyberbunker culminated in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that was so massive, it was claimed to have slowed internet speeds around the globe. The attack clogged servers with dummy internet traffic at a rate of about 300 gigabits per second. By comparison, the largest observed DDoS attacks typically against banks had thus far registered only 50 gigabits per second. The record breaking Spamhaus/Cyberbunker conflict arose 13 years after the publication of best practices on preventing DDoS attacks, and it was not an isolated event. Recently, NYU’s Courant Institute and Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute have collaboratively devised a game-theoretic approaches to address various cyber security problems involving exchange of information (asymmetrically). This research aims to discover and understand complex structures of malicious use cases within the context of secure systems with the goal of developing an incentives-based measurement system that ensures a high level of resilience to attack.	best practice;computer security;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;cyberbunker;data rate units;denial-of-service attack;dummy variable (statistics);game theory;gigabit;high-level programming language;malware;software engineering institute;system of measurement	William Casey;Jose Andre Morales;Thomson Nguyen;Jonathan M.

560a6f36530602eeac9d364676fbda7d2ce80aff	next generation p2p botnets: monitoring under adverse conditions		The effects of botnet attacks, over the years, have been devastating. From high volume Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to ransomware attacks, it is evident that defensive measures need to be taken. Indeed, there has been a number of successful takedowns of botnets that exhibit a centralized architecture. However, this is not the case with distributed botnets that are more resilient and armed with countermeasures against monitoring. In this paper, we argue that monitoring countermeasures, applied by botmasters, will only become more sophisticated; to such an extent that monitoring, under these adverse conditions, may become infeasible. That said, we present the most detailed analysis, to date, of parameters that influence a P2P botnet’s resilience and monitoring resistance. Integral to our analysis, we introduce BotChurn (BC) a realistic and botnet-focused churn generator that can assist in the analysis of botnets. Our experimental results suggest that certain parameter combinations greatly limit intelligence gathering operations. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the need for extensive collaboration between defenders. For instance, we show that even the combined knowledge of 500 monitoring instances is insufficient to fully enumerate some of the examined botnets. In this context, we also raise the question of whether botnet monitoring will still be feasible in the near future.	botnet	Leon Böck;Emmanouil Vasilomanolakis;Max Mühlhäuser;Shankar Karuppayah	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00470-5_24	computer science;psychological resilience;computer security;botnet;architecture;ransomware;countermeasure;denial-of-service attack	ML	-59.89932910576296	63.579765335470064	188432

In the proposed approach, time-stamped security data are continuously monitored within the target computer system or network and then processed by the knowledge-based temporal abstraction (KBTA) methodology. Using KBTA, continuously measured data (e.g., the number of running processes) and events (e.g., installation of a software) are integrated with a security-domain, temporal-abstraction knowledge-base (i.e., a security ontology for abstracting meaningful patterns from raw, time-oriented security data), to create higher-level, time-oriented concepts and patterns, also known as temporal abstractions. Automatically-generated temporal abstractions can be monitored to detect suspicious temporal patterns. These patterns are compatible with a set of predefined classes of malware as defined by a security expert employing a set of time and value constraints. The new approach was applied for detecting worm-related malware using two different ontologies. Evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the new approach. The approach can be used for detecting other types of malware by updating the security ontology with new definitions of temporal patterns.	computer;malware;network security;ontology (information science);sensor	Asaf Shabtai;Yuval Fledel;Yuval Elovici;Yuval Shahar	2009	Journal in Computer Virology	10.1007/s11416-009-0125-5	intrusion detection system;visualization;computer science;operating system;knowledge-based systems;data mining;database;computer security	Security	-62.63901002730089	62.81761360816436	188765

By taking advantages of the main features of such models, coupled with nature based models such as artificial immune systems we present a novel artificial immune and agent based intrusion detection model for large computer networks Our solution is based upon several security levels event based model, and a simple computational abstraction where an anomaly detection technique is designed to monitor the users' registrations to the operational targeted system, e.g., UNIX-like implementation. In our model, the events' generation model is processed using the Unix Syslog-ng tool, the events' analysis using the Logcheck tool, while the activities of the users and the execution of the both reactive and pro-active events' activities are implemented within an artificial immune and mobile agent based infrastructure. We have implemented and designed our model to differentiate among attacks, security violations, and several other security levels. In this paper we present our model, and show how mobile agent and artificial immune paradigms can be used to design efficient intrusion detection systems. We also discuss the validation of our model followed by a set of experiments we have carried out to evaluate the performance of our model using realistic case studies.	agent-based model;anomaly detection;artificial immune system;automata theory;cellular automaton;computer security;experiment;international parallel and distributed processing symposium;intrusion detection system;ising model;mobile agent;network security policy;norton internet security;persistence (computer science);simulation;unix;unix-like;syslog-ng	Renato B.

We develop a principled framework that automatically detects and classifies these deviations using statistical tests and ensemble learning. We evaluate our approach on a massive dataset collected at Google for 90 consecutive days. We argue that our approach combines desirable characteristics: it can accurately detect fraudulent machine-generated traffic; it is based on a fundamental characteristic of these attacks and is thus robust (e.g., to DHCP re-assignment) and hard to evade; it has low complexity and is easy to parallelize, making it suitable for large-scale detection; and finally, it does not entail profiling users, but leverages only aggregate statistics of network traffic.	aggregate data;anomaly detection;ensemble learning;machine learning;network traffic control;sensor;statistical model	Fabio Soldo;Ahmed Metwally	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195581	statistical hypothesis testing;anomaly detection;telecommunications;computer science;data mining;ensemble learning;world wide web;computer security;statistics;computer network	Security	-61.97717312176089	65.69715543789638	189123

Individuals or groups compete for limited resources using a variety of strategies, the most effective of which are reused and refined in later 'generations'. Traditionally this behavior has made detection of malicious entities very difficult because 1) recognition systems are often built on exact matching to a pattern that can only be 'learned' after a malicious entity reveals itself and 2) the enormous volume and variation in benign entities is an overwhelming source of previously unseen entities that often confound detectors.  To turn the tables of complexity on the would-be attackers, we have developed a method for mapping the sequence of behaviors in which cyber entities engage to strings of text and analyze these strings using modified bioinformatics algorithms. Bioinformatics algorithms optimize the alignment between text strings even in the presence of mismatches, insertions or deletions and do not require an a priori definition of the patterns one is seeking. Nor do they require any type of exact matching. This allows the data itself to suggest meaningful patterns that are conserved between cyber entities. We demonstrate this method on data generated from live network traffic.  The impact of this approach is that it can rapidly calculate similarity measures of previously unseen cyber entities in terms of well-characterized entities. These measures may also be used to organize large collections of data into families, making it possible to identify motifs indicative of each family.	algorithm;bioinformatics;entity;malware;network traffic control;sensor	Christopher S.

In order to be convincing, honeypots attempt to resemble actual systems that are in active use. Recently, researchers have begun to develop honeypots for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The tools of which we are aware have limited functionality compared to genuine devices. Particularly, they do not support running actual PLC programs.  In order to improve upon the interactive capabilities of PLC honeypots we set out to develop a simulator for Siemens S7-300 series PLCs. Our current prototype XPOT supports PLC program compilation and interpretation, the proprietary S7comm protocol and SNMP. While the supported feature set is not yet comprehensive, it is possible to program it using standard IDEs such as Siemens' TIA portal. Additionally, we emulate the characteristics of the network stack of our reference PLC in order to resist OS fingerprinting attempts using tools such as Nmap.  Initial experiments with students whom we trained in PLC programming indicate that XPOT may resist cursory inspection but still fails against knowledgeable and suspicious adversaries. We conclude that high-interactive PLC honeypots need to support a fairly complete feature set of the genuine, simulated PLC.	client honeypot;compiler;control system;experiment;fingerprint (computing);geforce 300 series;honeypot (computing);integrated development environment;interactivity;nmap security scanner;operating system;power-line communication;protocol stack;prototype;simple network management protocol;tcp/ip stack fingerprinting;television interface adaptor	Stephan Lau;Johannes Klick;Stephan Arndt;Volker Roth	2016		10.1145/2976749.2989063	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;honeypot;computer security;scada	Security	-58.33469171977349	65.35662145102181	189495
04cb05ad4c094e10872256641dad7705f43ef952	building an emulation environment for cyber security analyses of complex networked systems		Computer networks are undergoing a phenomenal growth, driven by the rapidly increasing number of nodes constituting the networks. At the same time, the number of security threats on Internet and intranet networks is constantly growing, and the testing and experimentation of cyber defense solutions requires the availability of separate, test environments that best emulate the complexity of a real system. Such environments support the deployment and monitoring of complex mission-driven network scenarios, thus enabling the study of cyber defense strategies under real and controllable traffic and attack scenarios.  In this paper, we propose a methodology that makes use of a combination of techniques of network and security assessment, and the use of cloud technologies to build an emulation environment with adjustable degree of affinity with respect to actual reference networks or planned systems. As a byproduct, starting from a specific study case, we collected a dataset consisting of complete network traces comprising benign and malicious traffic, which is feature-rich and publicly available.

We propose a defense mechanism which is largely automated and can be implemented on current software defined networking (SDN)-enabled networks. Our mechanism combines normal traffic learning, external blacklist information, and elastic capacity invocation in order to provide effective load control, filtering and service elasticity during an attack. We implement the mechanism and analyze its performance on a physical SDN testbed using a comprehensive set of real-life normal traffic traces and synthetic attack traces. The results indicate that the mechanism is effective in maintaining roughly 50% to 80% service levels even when hit by an overwhelming attack.	arp spoofing;ddos mitigation;denial-of-service attack;elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);load management;machine learning;real life;server (computing);slashdot effect;software deployment;software-defined networking;synthetic intelligence;testbed;tracing (software)	Aapo Kalliola;Kiryong Lee;Heejo Lee;Tuomas Aura	2015	2015 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Networking (CloudNet)	10.1109/CloudNet.2015.7335317	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-59.90571490057639	67.11343650157087	190755

To develop effective countermeasures, it is important to know how these attacks are launched in reality. For gathering the required data, a specialized SIP Honeynet System has been running since January 2009 and has recorded over 58 million SIP messages. The analyses have shown that SIP-based misuse is typically performed as a multistage attack and the IP address of the attacker changes before the actual Toll Fraud calls. To be able to correlate all attack stages despite intermediate changes of the attacker's IP address we developed the new Dynamic Honeynet System (DHS), which reacts according to the attackers' behaviour and uses a dynamic Honeypot configuration in real-time to significantly improve the detection efficiency. We present the architecture and new features such as dynamic reconfiguration and demonstrate its attack correlation capabilities. We developed a Sensor component to realize this system. The Sensor provides active monitoring based on signatures to detect attacks in real-time and controls the dynamic Honeypot.	antivirus software;attack patterns;authentication;countermeasure (computer);honeynet project;honeypot (computing);internet;misuse detection;multistage amplifier;open-source license;open-source software;overhead (computing);real-time clock;sensor;telephone number;tracing (software)	Dirk Hoffstadt;Niels Wolff;Stefan Monhof;Erwin P.

As large-scale network threats continue to evolve in sophistication and extend to widely deployed applications, we expect that interest in collaborative security monitoring infrastructures will continue to grow, because such attacks may not be easily diagnosed from a single point in the network. The intent of this position paper is not to argue the necessity of Internet-scale security data sharing infrastructures, as there is ample research [13, 48, 51, 54, 41, 47, 42] and operational examples [43, 17, 32, 53] that already make this case. Instead, we observe that these well-intended activities raise a unique set of risks and challenges.  We outline some of the most salient issues faced by global network security centers, survey proposed defense mechanisms, and pose several research challenges to the computer security community. We hope that this position paper will serve as a stimulus to spur groundbreaking new research in protection and analysis technologies that can facilitate the collaborative sharing of network security data while keeping data contributors safe and secure.	capacitor plague;computer security;global network;malware;network security;sanitization (classified information)	Phillip A.

7eee29d68a25d836411cc11ed0dcac52e61d0fc8	inside a phisher's mind: understanding the anti-phishing ecosystem through phishing kit analysis		Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent: 2016 saw more phishing attacks than any previous year on record according to the Anti-Phishing Working Group. At the same time, the growing level of sophistication of cybercriminals must be understood for the development of effective anti-phishing systems, as phishers have extensive control over the content they serve to their victims. By examining two large, real-world datasets of phishing kits and URLs from 2016 through mid-2017, we paint a clear picture of today's anti-phishing ecosystem while inferring the higher-level motives and thought processes of phishers. We analyze the nature of server-side .htaccess filtering techniques used by phishers to evade detection by the security community. We also propose a new generic classification scheme for phishing URLs which corresponds to modern social engineering techniques and reveals a correlation between URL type and compromised infrastructure use. Our analysis identifies measures that can be taken by the security community to defeat phishers' countermeasures and increase the likelihood of a timely response to phishing. We discover that phishers have a keen awareness of the infrastructure used against them, which illustrates the ever-evolving struggle between cybercriminals and security researchers and motivates future work to positively impact online security.	.htaccess;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;ecosystem;entity;phishing;response time (technology);server (computing);server-side;social engineering (security);web crawler	Adam Oest;Yeganeh Safaei;Adam Doupé;Gail-Joon Ahn;Brad Wardman;Gary Warner	2018	2018 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)	10.1109/ECRIME.2018.8376206	sophistication;security community;computer security;classification scheme;blacklisting;phishing;social engineering (security);business	Security	-56.74839871524793	61.93317959456638	191706

However, the log files are often massive, and much of the information they contain is not relevant to the investigation. Furthermore, the files almost always have a flat structure, which limits the ability to query them. Thus, digital forensic investigators find it extremely difficult and time consuming to extract and analyze evidence of attacks from log files. This paper describes an automated attack-tree-based approach for filtering irrelevant information from system log files and conducting systematic investigations of computer attacks.	attack (computing);attack tree;data logger;relevance	Nayot Poolsapassit;Indrajit Ray	2007			engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;network forensics	Security	-60.193037538366944	61.96984491081605	191721

Even private networks without external connections cannot hide from these attacks. Constant monitoring of the network is a vital element of an organization's security system. Among many monitoring techniques, network behavior analysis has become a common practice. Restricted private networks are characterized by a limited number of protocols. The normal traffic pattern of a network can be modeled as network constraints. Violation of any of these constraints indicates that an intrusion has occurred. This paper presents a novel framework to detect intrusions in a private network. We illustrate the framework with ten significant constraints on the real-time publish, subscribe and internet group management protocols. We present how the framework evaluates these constraints against traffic from an experimental network to prevent attacks.	intrusion detection system;network behavior anomaly detection;private network;real-time transcription;simulation;threat model	Md Siam Hasan;Ali ElShakankiry;Thomas R.

Therefore, modeling and simulation are becoming more and more important in optimizing the behavior  of security systems, including security components intended for protecting various distributed geographic information systems  (GIS). This paper presents an approach and software simulation environment for comprehensive investigation of the Security  Operation Center (SOCBox) system which is in essence an intrusion detection “metasystem”. SOCBox collects data from a wide  range of sources (intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, routers, workstations, etc.) and therefore has a global view  on the network. The simulation environment has been developed formerly for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and  defense simulation. This tool is characterized by agentoriented approach, the packet-based imitation of network security processes  and the open library of different attacks and defense mechanisms. We consider the SOCBox structure, the simulation environment  architecture, the SOCBox models in the simulation environment and peculiarities of SOCBox simulation.  	security operations center;simulation	Julien Bourgeois;Abdoul Karim Ganame;Igor V.

0c444137a53f7511acaf13d5360662664f8cfea7	an integrated intrusion detection system for credit card fraud detection		Computer security is one of the key areas where lot of research is be- ing done. Many intrusion detection techniques are proposed to ensure the net- work security, protect network resources and network infrastructures. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) attempt to detect attacks by gathering network data and analyze the information from various areas to identify the possible intrusions. This paper proposes an IDS combining three approaches such as anomaly, mi- suse and decision making model to produce better detection accuracy and a de- creased false positive rate. The integrated IDS can be built to detect the attacks in credit card system using Hidden Markov approach in the anomaly detection module. The credit card holder's behaviours are taken as attributes and the anomalous transactions are found by the spending profile of the user. The trans- actions that are considered to be anomalous or abnormal are then sent to the misuse detection system. Here, the transactions are compared with predefined attack types and then sent to the decision making model to classify it as known/unknown type of attack. Finally, the decision-making module is used to integrate the detected results and report the types of attacks in credit card sys- tem. As abnormal transactions are analyzed carefully in each of the module, the fraud rate is reduced and system is immune to attacks.	credit card fraud;intrusion detection system	M. Sasirekha;I.

In this paper we propose for the first time an automated technique to extract and validate IOCs for web applications, by analyzing the information collected by a high-interaction honeypot. Our approach has several advantages compared with traditional techniques used to detect malicious websites. First of all, not all the compromised web pages are malicious or harmful for the user. Some may be defaced to advertise product or services, and some may be part of affiliate programs to redirect users toward (more or less legitimate) online shopping websites. In any case, it is important to detect these pages to inform their owners and to alert the users on the fact that the content of the page has been compromised and cannot be trusted. Also in the case of more traditional drive-by-download pages, the use of IOCs allows for a prompt detection and correlation of infected pages, even before they may be blocked by more traditional URLs blacklists. Our experiments show that our system is able to automatically generate web indicators of compromise that have been used by attackers for several months (and sometimes years) in the wild without being detected. So far, these apparently harmless scripts were able to stay under the radar of the existing detection methodologies – despite being hosted for a long time on public web sites.	affiliate marketing;drive-by download;experiment;honeypot (computing);indicator of compromise;malware;online shopping;radar;redirection (computing);web application;web page	Onur Catakoglu;Marco Balduzzi;Davide Balzarotti	2016		10.1145/2872427.2883056	phishing;computer science;information security;internet security;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-56.786507048069126	62.02807574416646	192620

A method is presented that can discover recurrent patterns from multiple flows of events, such as alarms and configuration events, as well as discrete information, such as traffic and usage, taking into account static and dynamic information concerning observed objects and their environments. This method can filter out theoretically useless patterns, using a novel technique for detecting chaos in sequences of events. The prediction accuracy of the discovered patterns has been measured using objects with dynamic behavior controlled by known and complex differential equations. The proposed mining method has been used for discovering and predicting alarms in a computer network composed of several Internet servers taking into account the alarm and configuration events history, as well as static information about these servers.	algorithm;chaos theory;sensor	Marlon Núñez;Rafael Morales Bueno;Francisco Triguero Ruiz	2002	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2002.1003040	computer science;data science;knowledge-based systems;data mining;world wide web;differential equation;computer network	Metrics	-62.677221600431814	63.52671585535962	192936
13e81896dc3c382336972243e7a054a1484b891e	learning behavioral fingerprints from netflows using timed automata		We present a novel way to detect infected hosts and identify malware in networks by analyzing network communication statistics with state-of-the-art automata learning algorithms. The automata encode patterns of short-term interactions in known malicious hosts, and are used to obtain small but effective fingerprints of machine behavior. We showcase the effectiveness of our system, named BASTA1 (Behavioral Analytics System using Timed Automata), on a public dataset containing Netflow traces of real-world botnet malware. Compared to a deep packet inspection of communication content, Netflows are easy and cheap to collect and analyze, and preserve a greater degree of privacy. Even though the high level of abstraction in Netflow data makes it more difficult to utilize it, BASTA shows very impressive results achieving high accuracy in several settings while returning few false positives. It is also capable of detecting infections of previously unseen malware.	algorithm;automata theory;behavioral analytics;botnet;deep packet inspection;dynamic programming;encode;experiment;fingerprint;fingerprint (computing);high-level programming language;incidence matrix;interaction;international federation for information processing;machine learning;malware;microsoft windows;sensor;timed automaton;tracing (software)	Gaetano Pellegrino;Qin Lin;Christian A.

3cb9dc08a9b2b8885580ee37ead87c2397e0e26d	industrial control system traffic data sets for intrusion detection research		Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems monitor and control physical processes associated with the critical infrastructure. Weaknesses in the application layer protocols, however, leave SCADA networks vulnerable to attack. In response, cyber security researchers have developed myriad intrusion detection systems. Researchers primarily rely on unique threat models and the corresponding network traffic data sets to train and validate their intrusion detection systems. This leads to a situation in which researchers cannot independently verify the results, cannot compare the effectiveness of different intrusion detection systems, and cannot adequately validate the ability of intrusion detection systems to detect various classes of attacks. Indeed, a common data set is needed that can be used by researchers to compare intrusion detection approaches and implementations. This paper describes four data sets, which include network traffic, process control and process measurement features from a set of 28 attacks against two laboratory-scale industrial control systems that use the MODBUS application layer protocol. The data sets, which are freely available, enable effective comparisons of intrusion detection solutions for SCADA systems.	control system;intrusion detection system	Thomas H.

c704bfd98bc52bfa2947192ca24c6e4c61e5cba4	intelligent intrusion detection system using clustered self organized map		The impact of information security breaching becomes bigger and complicated to ignore every day. New and more sophisticated attacks are emerging and developed; requiring the information systems and networks be protected in a highly flexible and accurate manner. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are considered one of the basic building blocks of the protection wall against these intrusive activities through detecting it before it hits the network systems. Artificial neural networks have been used successfully for addressing the high accuracy and precision demands of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we built an intelligent intrusion detection system using clustered version of Self-Organized Map (SOM) network. The proposed system consists of two subsequent stages: first, SOM network was built, then a hierarchical agglomerative clustering using k-means was applied on SOM neurons. The proposed work in this research paper addresses the issues of sensitivity and time consumption for each connection record processing. The proposed system was demonstrated using NSL-KDD benchmark dataset, where it has achieved superior sensitivity reached up to 96.66 % in less than 0.08 milliseconds per connection record.	artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;data mining;hierarchical clustering;information security;information system;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;self-organizing map;sensor	Muder Almiani;Alia Abu Ghazleh;Amer Al-Rahayfeh;Abdul Razaque	2018	2018 Fifth International Conference on Software Defined Systems (SDS)	10.1109/SDS.2018.8370435	artificial neural network;information system;machine learning;accuracy and precision;information security;hierarchical clustering;intrusion detection system;software;artificial intelligence;computer science	Security	-61.70293947057281	63.57841951045399	193346

Among the DDoS methods, SYN flood is the most common. Having realized the complexity and difficulty in dest-end detection, scholars switched their focus on ‘source-end detection’. And CUSUM is considered an efficient method in source-end detection. However, now there is no guidance about how to set the parameters in CUSUM, which dramatically affects the outcome of the detection. So this article discusses the selection of this parameter, to provide reference for further research.	syn flood	Bo Yang;Xueyuan Wang	2011		10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6022850	trinoo;computer science;information security;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Vision	-57.84321333813555	66.02857990426149	193509

Derived from the low layers, new application-layer-based DDoS attacks utilizing legitimate HTTP requests to overwhelm victim resources are more undetectable. The case may be more serious when such attacks mimic or occur during the flash crowd event of a popular Website. Focusing on the detection for such new DDoS attacks, a scheme based on document popularity is introduced. An Access Matrix is defined to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of a normal flash crowd. Principal component analysis and independent component analysis are applied to abstract the multidimensional Access Matrix. A novel anomaly detector based on hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the dynamics of Access Matrix and to detect the attacks. The entropy of document popularity fitting to the model is used to detect the potential application-layer DDoS attacks. Numerical results based on real Web traffic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	access control matrix;anomaly detection;curve fitting;denial-of-service attack;experiment;film-type patterned retarder;hidden semi-markov model;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;internet;markov chain;onset (audio);principal component analysis;semiconductor industry;sensor;server (computing);server log;simulation;slashdot effect;web traffic	Yi Xie;Shunzheng Yu	2009	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1145/1514070.1514072	trinoo;computer science;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;world wide web;computer security;denial-of-service attack;statistics;computer network	Security	-61.12001695033383	65.847718954723	194049
ed3c4ca8288d9ff749873ad61e20840e1387a697	name filter: a countermeasure against information leakage attacks in named data networking		Named data networking (NDN) has emerged as a future networking architecture having the potential to replace the Internet. In order to do so, the NDN needs to cope with inherent problems of the Internet, such as attacks that cause information leakage from an enterprise. Since NDN has not yet been deployed on a large scale, it is currently unknown how such attacks can occur, let alone what countermeasures can be taken against them. In this paper, we first show that information leakage in NDN can be caused by malware inside an enterprise, which uses steganography to produce malicious interest names encoding confidential information. We investigate such attacks by utilizing a content name dataset based on uniform resource locators (URLs) collected by a Web crawler. Our main contribution is a name filter based on anomaly detection that takes the dataset as input and classifies a name in the Interest as legitimate or not. Our evaluation shows that the malware can exploit the path part in the URL-based NDN name to create malicious names, thus, information leakage in the NDN cannot be prevented completely. However, we show for the first time that our filter can dramatically choke the leakage throughput causing the malware to be 137 times less efficient at leaking information. This finding opens up an interesting avenue of research that could result in a safer future networking architecture.

Many OSNs view this data as a valuable asset that is at the core of their business model. Both OSN users and OSNs have strong incentives to restrict large scale crawls of this data. OSN users want to protect their privacy and OSNs their business interest. Traditional defenses against crawlers involve rate- limiting browsing activity per user account. These defense schemes, however, are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where a crawler creates a large number of fake user accounts. In this paper, we propose Genie, a system that can be deployed by OSN operators to defend against Sybil crawlers. Genie is based on a simple yet powerful insight: the social network itself can be leveraged to defend against Sybil crawlers. We first present Genie's design and then discuss how Genie can limit crawlers while allowing browsing of user profiles by normal users.	genie;online community;personally identifiable information;privacy;social network;sybil attack;user (computing);user profile;web crawler	Mainack Mondal;Bimal Viswanath;Allen Clement;Peter Druschel;Krishna P.

b280654b8ba60a987fa6eae40827f697a5bea063	automatic detection of dns manipulations	dns	The DNS is a fundamental service that has been repeatedly attacked and abused. DNS manipulation is a prominent case: Recursive DNS resolvers are deployed to explicitly return manipulated answers to users' queries. While DNS manipulation is used for legitimate reasons too (e.g., parental control), rogue DNS resolvers support malicious activities, such as malware and viruses, exposing users to phishing and content injection. We introduce REMeDy, a system that assists operators to identify the use of rogue DNS resolvers in their networks. REMeDy is a completely automatic and parameter-free system that evaluates the consistency of responses across the resolvers active in the network. It operates by passively analyzing DNS traffic and, as such, requires no active probing of third-party servers. REMeDy is able to detect resolvers that manipulate answers, including resolvers that affect unpopular domains. We validate REMeDy using large-scale DNS traces collected in ISP networks where more than 100 resolvers are regularly used by customers. REMeDy automatically identifies regular resolvers, and pinpoint manipulated responses. Among those, we identify both legitimate services that offer additional protection to clients, and resolvers under the control of malwares that steer traffic with likely malicious goals.

However, most protocols in SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the system security, but few of them can effectively resist response injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection, especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our IDS mechanism.	algorithm;authentication;code injection;computer simulation;data acquisition;denial-of-service attack;experiment;intrusion detection system;network traffic control;polynomial;pro tools;quasiperiodicity;time complexity;ultima vii part two: serpent isle	Jiexin Zhang;Shaoduo Gan;Xiaoxue Liu;Peidong Zhu	2016	2016 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communication (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2016.7543760	intrusion detection system;embedded system;communications protocol;computer science;operating system;telemetry;computer security;computer network;scada	Security	-60.61652370799913	66.06471206745705	194897

Given a history of packet transmissions and an excerpt of a possible packet payload, a payload attribution system (PAS) makes it feasible to identify the sources, destinations, and the times of appearance on a network of all the packets that contained the specified payload excerpt. A PAS, as one of the core components in a network forensics system, enables investigating cybercrimes on the Internet by, for example, tracing the spread of worms and viruses, identifying who has received a phishing e-mail in an enterprise, or discovering which insider allowed an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.  Due to the increasing volume of network traffic in today's networks, it is infeasible to effectively store and query all the actual packets for extended periods of time in order to allow analysis of network events for investigative purposes; therefore, we focus on extremely compressed digests of the packet activity. We propose several new methods for payload attribution, which utilize Rabin fingerprinting, shingling, and winnowing. Our best methods allow building practical payload attribution systems, which provide data reduction ratios greater than 100:1 while supporting efficient queries with very low false positive rates. We demonstrate the properties of the proposed methods and specifically analyze their performance and practicality when used as modules of a network forensics system ForNet. Our experimental results outperform current state-of-the-art methods both in terms of false positives and data reduction ratio. Finally, these approaches directly allow the collected data to be stored and queried by an untrusted party without disclosing any payload information nor the contents of queries.	access control;authorization;bloom;cybercrime;email;fingerprint (computing);information sensitivity;key (cryptography);network packet;network traffic control;one-way function;payload (computing);phishing;requirement;the times;w-shingling	Miroslav Ponec;Paul Giura;Joel Wein;Hervé Brönnimann	2010	ACM Trans.

One of the major security flaws experienced by WSNs is denial of service (DoS) which can even lead to the breakdown of the complete system or to wrong decisions being made by the system that can cause adverse results. This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.	access control;artificial neural network;denial-of-service attack;machine learning;prowler;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;simulation;support vector machine	Aswathy B.

748211d7df566743f5ca8affb2af53ff8d1a45e6	bigbing: privacy-preserving cloud-based malware classification service		Although cloud-based malware defense services have made significant contributions to thwarting malware attacks, there have been privacy concern over using these services to analyze suspicious files which may contain user-sensitive data. We develop a new platform called BigBing (a big data approach to binary code genomics) to offer a privacy-preserving cloud-based malware classification service. BigBing relies on a community of contributors who would like to share their binary executables, and uses a novel blockchain-based scheme to ensure the privacy of possibly user-sensitive data contained within these files. To scale up malware defense services, BigBing trains user-specific classification models to detect malware attacks seen in their environments. We have implemented a prototype of BigBing, comprised of a big data cluster, a pool of servers for feature extraction, and a frontend gateway that facilitates the interaction between users and the BigBing backend. Using a real-world malware dataset, we evaluate both execution and classification performances of the service offered by BigBing. Our experimental results demonstrate that BigBing offers a useful privacy-preserving cloud-based malware classification service to fight against the ever-growing malware attacks.	big data;binary code;bitcoin;cloud computing;computation (action);contain (action);executable;feature extraction;malware;microsoft windows;performance;privacy;prototype;responsiveness;silo (dataset)	Yunus Kucuk;Nikhil Patil;Zhan Shu;Guanhua Yan	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Privacy-Aware Computing (PAC)	10.1109/PAC.2018.00011	data mining;feature extraction;malware;big data;executable;information privacy;default gateway;cloud computing;server;computer science	Security	-59.80942521523698	62.103413044012456	195377

SQL attacks are those attacks that take advantage of using SQL statements to be performed. The problem of detection of this class of attacks is transformed to time series prediction problem. SQL queries are used as a source of events in a protected environment. To differentiate between normal SQL queries and those sent by an attacker we divide SQL statements into tokens and pass them to our detection system, which predicts the next token, taking into account previously seen tokens. In the learning phase tokens are passed to recurrent neural network (RNN) trained by back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. Teaching data are shifted by one token forward in time with relation to input. The purpose of the testing phase is to predict the next token in the sequence. All experiments were conducted on Jordan and Elman networks using data gathered from PHP Nuke portal. Experimental results show that the Jordan network outperforms the Elman network predicting correctly queries of the length up to ten.	algorithm;artificial neural network;attack (computing);backpropagation through time;client (computing);experiment;genetic algorithm;gradient;machine learning;nuke;php;random neural network;recurrent neural network;sql;sensor;software propagation;time series	Jaroslaw Skaruz;Franciszek Seredynski	2007	2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370428	sql injection;computer science;information security;recurrent neural network;backpropagation;machine learning;data mining;database	NLP	-62.40517619139096	63.32911285722843	195806

Although understanding Android malware using dynamic analysis can provide a comprehensive view, it is still subjected to high cost in environment deployment and manual efforts in investigation. In this study, we propose a static feature-based mechanism to provide a static analyst paradigm for detecting the Android malware. The mechanism considers the static information including permissions, deployment of components, Intent messages passing and API calls for characterizing the Android applications behavior. In order to recognize different intentions of Android malware, different kinds of clustering algorithms can be applied to enhance the malware modeling capability. Besides, we leverage the proposed mechanism and develop a system, called Droid Mat. First, the Droid Mat extracts the information (e.g., requested permissions, Intent messages passing, etc) from each application's manifest file, and regards components (Activity, Service, Receiver) as entry points drilling down for tracing API Calls related to permissions. Next, it applies K-means algorithm that enhances the malware modeling capability. The number of clusters are decided by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method on the low rank approximation. Finally, it uses kNN algorithm to classify the application as benign or malicious. The experiment result shows that the recall rate of our approach is better than one of well-known tool, Androguard, published in Black hat 2011, which focuses on Android malware analysis. In addition, Droid Mat is efficient since it takes only half of time than Androguard to predict 1738 apps as benign apps or Android malware.	android;application programming interface;black hat;cluster analysis;k-means clustering;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;low-rank approximation;malware analysis;programming paradigm;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;singular value decomposition;software deployment	Dong-Jie Wu;Ching-Hao Mao;Te-En Wei;Hahn-Ming Lee;Kuo-Ping Wu	2012	2012 Seventh Asia Joint Conference on Information Security	10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2012.18	anomaly detection;message passing;computer science;operating system;cryptovirology;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;static analysis	SE	-57.16347342086869	60.57589537064925	196499

IDPSes can be network or host-based and can collaborate in order to provide better detections of malicious traffic. Although several IDPS systems have been proposed, their appropriate configuration and control for effective detection and prevention of attacks has always been far from trivial. Another concern is related to the slowing down of system performance when maximum security is applied, hence the need to trade off between security enforcement levels and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. In this paper we motivate the need for and present a policy-based framework for the configuration and control of the security enforcement mechanisms of an enterprise information system. The approach is based on dynamic adaptation of security measures based on the assessment of system vulnerability and threat prediction and provides several levels of attack containment. As an application, we have implemented a dynamic policy-based adaptation mechanism between the Snort signature-based IDPS and the light weight anomaly-based FireCol IDS. Experiments conducted over the DARPA 2000 and 1999 intrusion detection evaluation datasets show the viability of our framework1.	anomaly detection;bro;configuration management;enterprise information system;experiment;intrusion detection system;malware;overhead (computing);risk management;sensor;snort;threat model;usability	Khalid Alsubhi;Issam Aib;Jérôme François;Raouf Boutaba	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199341	intrusion detection system;entropy;security management;index term;security information and event management;risk management;computer science;configuration management;internet privacy;computer security;intrusion prevention system;information system;enterprise information system;computer network	Security	-62.79736290984075	62.7083268221847	196634

Both SOM and DM models were then generated for frontal, side, and rear collisions of two-vehicle crashes. Appropriateness of all generated models was evaluated and confirmed. Finally, a decision support tool was developed using active server pages. Although with small data size, the decision support system was considered capable of giving reasonably good liability attributions and references on given cases.	authentication;data mining;decision support system;map;organizing (structure);self-organization	Pei Liu	2009	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2008.06.032	decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;computer security	ML	-61.67903635567276	63.47169241750715	197127

Also, a functional algorithm based on a non-classical logic called Paraconsistent Logic is proposed aiming to avoid high false alarms rates. The key idea of the proposed approach is to characterize the normal behavior of network traffic and then identify the traffic patterns behavior that might harm networks services. Experimental results on a real network demonstrate the effectiveness the proposed approach. The results are promising, showing that the flow analysis performed is able to detect anomalous traffic with precision, sensitivity and good performance.	algorithm;anomaly detection;autoregressive integrated moving average;data-flow analysis;digital signature;experiment;internet backbone;network segment;network traffic control;paraconsistent logic;sensitivity and specificity	Eduardo H.

When the mobile devices and cloud computing technology start to play important parts of our life, they have become more susceptible to attacks. In recent years, phishing and malicious websites have increasingly become serious problems in the field of network security. Attackers use many approaches to implant malware into target hosts in order to steal significant data and cause substantial damage. The growth of malware has been very rapid, and the purpose has changed from destruction to penetration. The signatures of malware have become more difficult to detect. In addition to static signatures, malware also tries to conceal dynamic signatures from anti-virus inspection. In this research, we use hooking techniques to trace the dynamic signatures that malware tries to hide. We then compare the behavioural differences between malware and benign programs by using data mining techniques in order to identify the malware. The experimental results show that our detection rate reaches 95% with only 80 attributes. This means that our method can achieve a high detection rate with low complexity.	antivirus software;application programming interface;cloud computing;data mining;hooking;internet;malware;mobile device;network security;phishing;windows 95	Chun-I Fan;Han-Wei Hsiao;Chun-Han Chou;Yi-Fan Tseng	2015	2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference	10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.241	asprox botnet;cyber-collection;application programming interface;feature extraction;biological classification;computer science;cryptovirology;accuracy and precision;malware;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-57.96664807632113	61.04470884458509	198678

A major reason for this is the misuse detection system’s dependence on aud it data and the absence of low-level network data in audit trails. This work defines low-level IP vulnerabilities and dis tinguishes between low-level IP and IP-based vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we analyze a number of different low-level IP atta cks nd the vulnerabilities that they exploit. We develop attack signatures for each attack, and based upon our analysis, we determine a baseline collection of information needed to detect the attacks. We suggest locations within protocol stacks where the n eded data can be collected. Finally, we generalize from the baseline audit data to try to predict audit content suitab le not only for detecting these attacks, but possible future ones.	antivirus software;baseline (configuration management);high- and low-level;information technology audit;limbo;misuse detection;sensor	Thomas E.

Therefore, an intrusion detection system on large network is need to efficient real-time detection.

1034f4a32a33501c67fad62440bde0e811887dbc	enhancing and identifying cloning attacks in online social networks	sybil attack;online social networks;security;privacy;identity theft	Recently Online Social Networks (OSNs) are enjoying a continuous boom, while suffering from omnifarious malicious attacks. Cloning attack is one of the attack patterns towards online social networks, where typically the attacker disguises fake accounts as real users by thieving and copying their profiles, and sends friend requests to the friends of the cloned victim. It is difficult for ordinary users to detect these fake identities because of the identical names and similar profile information. In this paper, we raise two possible improvements, namely snowball sampling and iteration attack, to the regular attack pattern upgrading its efficiency and power, so that the attackers can more easily engage into the community. An experiment has been conducted on Renren, the largest OSN in China, to fully compare and substantiate the effectiveness of the enhanced strategy with traditional attacks and different levels of cloning attacks. Then we discuss approaches to detect cloning attacks and put forward a detector named CloneSpotter, which can be deployed into OSN servers. The detector takes advantage of the detailed login IP records and provides solid evidence of locations, in order to judge whether the suspicious accounts are manipulated by real users or attackers. Besides, we discuss a content-based approach to protect users from cloning attacks, which can be easily implemented into distributed clients.  Our contribution lies in two aspects. First, we improve a threatening attack pattern towards OSNs, and test its effectiveness in real systems. Second, we provide an effective defense method to detect cloning attacks, which is real-time and lightweight. By deploying the detectors, OSN systems can assist users to accurately distinguish cloning accounts, and safeguard their privacy.	attack patterns;iteration;login;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);sensor;social network	Zifei Shan;Haowen Cao;Jason Lv;Cong Yan;Annie Liu	2013		10.1145/2448556.2448615	identity theft;telecommunications;computer science;information security;database;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-56.88740765897541	63.19518400763475	199939
