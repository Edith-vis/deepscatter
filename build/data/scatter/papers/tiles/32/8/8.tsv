We identify variables such as social awareness, social interaction, and social quality that may play an important role. We test our research model by means of a controlled laboratory experiment conducted in a virtual world, Second Life. The results show that perceived social interactions and social awareness positively influence the cognitive absorption that an individual feels when using virtual worlds. These are influenced by an individual’s social skills, and his/her perception of the social quality of the technology. Cognitive absorption in turn significantly predicts outcomes such as the satisfaction with, and the intention to return to the virtual world.	interaction;second life;virtual world	Lakshmi Goel;Sonja Prokopec	2009			computer science;social learning;social environment;knowledge management;social engagement;social psychology (sociology);social relation;social computing;social competence;metaverse;social psychology	HCI	-56.80211463689611	-48.853097049608856	150031

We exploit the interest of the autistic children in regular patterns and order to stimulate their motivational, explorative and social skills. As a result we have developed a toy that consists of undefined number of cubes that express emergent behavior by communicating with each other and changing their colors as a result of how they have been positioned by the players. The user tests have shown increased time of engagement of the children with the toy in comparison with their usual play routines, pronounced explorative behavior and encouraging results with improvement of turn taking interaction.	color;emergence;olap cube;undefined behavior	Emilia I.

Therefore we investigated the effects of embodied tangible agents outside of the screen for children's interest and learning. All experiments were conducted with 6-7 year old children and stimulus was a kind of storybook-animation. As a result, with embodied agents outside of the screen, children felt higher degree of agent presence, and also a higher degree of an interest about agents and more interaction with agents. And it induced stronger persona effects in learning than with animated agents on the screen. Also children had a statistically significant increase in vocabulary learning. This study had implication about designing effective tangible agents for children.

b012d85a878ad67fe2add27b103e5a7bff87a0c8	how end users express conditionals in programming by demonstration for mobile apps		Though conditionals are an integral component of programming, providing an easy means of creating conditionals remains a challenge for programming-by-demonstration (PBD) systems for task automation. We hypothesize that a promising method for implementing conditionals in such systems is to incorporate the use of verbal instructions. Verbal instructions supplied concurrently with demonstrations have been shown to improve the generalizability of PBD. However, the challenge of supporting conditional creation using this multi-modal approach has not been addressed. In this extended abstract, we present our study on understanding how end users describe conditionals in natural language for mobile app tasks. We conducted a formative study of 56 participants asking them to verbally describe conditionals in different settings for 9 sample tasks and to invent conditional tasks. Participant responses were analyzed using open coding and revealed that, in the context of mobile apps, end users often omit desired else statements when explaining conditionals, sometimes use ambiguous concepts in expressing conditionals, and often desire to implement complex conditionals. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for designing a multimodal PBD interface to support the creation of conditionals.	mobile app;modal logic;multimodal interaction;natural language;programming by demonstration	Marissa Radensky;Toby Jia-Jun Li;Brad A.

Although design guidelines and cognitive theories on information visualization exist, they are often understudied for use with older adults. In an effort to evaluate interactive health visualizations with older adults, the authors applied and compared a benchmark evaluation, an insight-based evaluation, and a subjective usability questionnaire. They were unable to identify statistically significant differences between visualizations using the benchmark evaluation, but found moderate differences with the perceived usability scale and more granular differences through the insight evaluation.	benchmark (computing);cognition;drug evaluation;imagery;information system;information visualization;theory;usability	Thai Le;Hilaire J Thompson;George Demiris	2016	IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications	10.1109/MCG.2015.93	benchmark;text mining;simulation;visualization;computer science;system usability scale;data science;data mining;multimedia;computer graphics;geriatrics;informatics	HCI	-59.10594506917427	-48.86457520850105	152851

Researchers evaluate their sign language animation systems by collecting subjective judgments and comprehension-question responses from deaf participants. Through a survey (N=62) and multiple regression analysis, we identified relationships between (a) demographic and technology experience/attitude characteristics of participants and (b) the subjective and objective scores collected from them during the evaluation of sign language animation systems. This finding suggests that it would be important for researchers to collect and report these characteristics of their participants in publications about their studies, but there is currently no consensus in the field. We present a set of questions in ASL and English that can be used by researchers to measure these participant characteristics; reporting such data would enable researchers to better interpret and compare results from studies with different participant pools.	accessibility;emoticon	Hernisa Kacorri;Matt Huenerfauth;Sarah Ebling;Kasmira Patel;Mackenzie Willard	2015		10.1145/2700648.2809860	anime;sociolinguistics of sign languages;speech recognition;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-58.55489464336538	-47.522261478006804	153033
3945c93b4b27e0a6ddaea5f1febae915abb4f4b5	an awareness system for supporting remote communication - application to long-distance relationships		"""Recently, the methods of conducting long distance communication have dramatically changed due to improvements in communication technology including TV phones, e-mail, and SNS (Social Networking Services). However, people still have difficulty in enjoying sufficient long distance communication because subtle nuance and atmosphere are difficult to be felt in a distant place. For example, there are many romantic partners with feelings of anxiety about long-distance relationships. This is because an environment that allows the partners to understand each other has not been sufficiently supported. The pur- pose of this study is to help people separated by a long distance to understand each other by enabling the sensing of a partner's feelings from the partner's be- havior. Our target is long-distance romantic partners. When people feel, sense, or are conscious of another person's existence or state, this ability or state is called """"awareness."""". Awareness is nonverbal communication. Awareness shar- ing among people is very important for managing relationships successfully, especially for people separated by a long distance. This is because a partner will develop feelings of unease if awareness sharing is not adequate. Our approach is as follows. First, examine what kind of action is useful for representing the feeling of love. Next, monitor these actions in partners. Third, summarize ac- tions to quantitative indications. The prototype system was evaluated through evaluation experiments. Three pairs of partners used the system for two weeks. The result verified the effectiveness of this system as it promoted mutual com- munication."""

The text reports findings of a case study based on the investigation of reminding activities and request practices in the specific context of supported living. These activities turn out to be highly adaptive processes that are embedded in complex assistive networks. The process of reminding and requesting represents a central practice deployed by the assistive institutional and social environment. It suggests to provide a consistent structure that meets individual needs in everyday life of cognitively impaired people. In the light of the development and engineering of assistive technologies we discuss if and how human practices could serve as a basis for modeling an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) based assistive system for cognitively impaired people with respect to the adherence of their autonomy.	assistive technology;dialog system;embedded system;embodied agent;embodied cognition	Antje Amrhein;Katharina Cyra;Karola Pitsch	2016			simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-58.42108647736894	-51.96652948416506	154001

Ten relatively healthy independently living older adults were interviewed using ethnographic processes to determine a baseline of social activities, behaviours and nocturnal sleeping routines. Each home was fitted with six sensing elements to establish and monitor daily and nocturnal activities. Sociality behaviours were explored through social contact through phone conversation and human interaction, through mobility, inside and outside the home, and through a person's self reported internal state (how they feel each day). Nocturnal rhythms were examined through actigraph watches and bed pressure sensing devices. A preliminary sub set of the results are presented in this paper in the form of case studies showing subjective and objective data sets and their comparison to social routines.

Our research revolved around the iterative design of Floffy: the environmental robot, which was essentially a playful toy robot that would respond positively to interaction that was beneficial for the environment and the child’s own well being and negatively to interaction or behaviour that was detrimental to the surroundings. We conducted an explorative, informal evaluation of Floffy with two small groups of children and they rated their experience with it positively. Our results show that there is potential in utilizing entertainment robots to educate children on serious and critical issues such as saving our environment and being sustainable.	human–robot interaction;iteration;iterative design;robot;robotics	Omar Mubin;Luke Vink;Pieter Oosterwijk;Abdullah Al Mahmud;Suleman Shahid	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40498-6_46		HCI	-57.06513951063855	-51.04319934299689	155162
5d649f96d901673e47e0a08bae8ed2d84d21a582	monitoring interpersonal relationships through games with social dilemma	social dilemma;interpersonal relationship	In this paper we introduce a method to monitor interpersonal relations through a game with a social dilemma. In the game players can interact with each other through negotiations and by exchanges of resources. To enable the monitoring of interpersonal relations this environment confronts players with specially selected instances of the game, where strategies based on different social factors (like helpfulness or fairness) will enforce different choices in the game. An evolutionary inspired optimization was used to find the games with the special social setting. The special selection of the games helps us to relate the observed actions directly to parameters that model strategies that the players are likely to adopt. Through an estimation of these parameters we are able to observe quantitative differences in the social preferences by different players. Moreover, we demonstrate that players play differently depending on whom they are interacting with. This strongly indicates that the observed playing styles can reveal certain aspects of the relations between players.	fairness measure;galileo (satellite navigation);interaction;karl wiegers;mathematical optimization;pareto efficiency;vadim gerasimov	Roman Gorbunov;Emilia I.

In this paper, we present a two-step procedural content generation framework to minimize players’ frustration and/or boredom according to player feedback and gameplay features. In the first step, we dynamically categorize the player styles based on a simple questionnaire beforehand and the gameplay features. In the second step, two player models (frustration & boredom) are built for each player style category. A ranking algorithm is utilized for player modeling to address two problems inherent in player feedback: inconsistency and inaccuracy. Experiment results on a testbed game show that our framework can generate less boring/frustrating levels with very high probabilities.	algorithm;categorization;experiment;feedback;game theory;pc game;procedural generation;regular expression;simulation;testbed	Hong Yu;Tyler Trawick	2011			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	AI	-55.78469608213713	-47.24327327544847	156769

144753fa6b6a126d40c5c881cedabceed514fbb6	an unobtrusive practical method to derive individual's lighting conditions in office environments		The benefits of light in offices beyond enabling visual tasks have been demonstrated in former studies. Light positively influences outcome measures such as human's health, wellbeing, visual comfort, motivation, and environmental satisfaction. In order to measure the effects of light on the individual outcome measures, it is of high importance to correctly measure lighting conditions in realistic environments per individual. This paper describes a six-step practical method to derive lighting conditions for all work places in an office building based on continuous reference measurements. The method proposed in this paper allows the shift from laboratory studies to field studies so that the real effect of office lighting can be investigated simultaneously while the office worker is doing his or her real work.	money;unobtrusive javascript	J. van Duijnhoven;C. de Bakker;M.

However, the impact of monetizing of applications and personality traits has so far been largely unattended. We have therefore extended our research to cover monetizing models of mobile applications. In this paper, we aim to enhance the understanding of the relationship between the “big five personality traits” and the usages and purchase intention of mobile applications in difference categories. Our initial data for the pilot study consists of 173 individuals, collected from smart device consumers who live in Bangkok, Thailand. Pearson’s correlation and multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the data. The initial results indicate that some personality traits are associated with the usages and intention to purchase mobile applications. It is highly possible to conclude from the data that conscientious persons placed more intention to use productive applications. Specifically, this personality trait has a positive relationship with utilities, education, business and maps and navigation. Neuroticism reported only significant relation with in-app purchase in utilities applications. Agreeableness showed no significance during our regressions analysis. The most widely used paid application among all traits is entertainment. The findings of this pilot study will serve as indicators for the direction of our planned future research in this field.

For this purpose, we performed a user study with 40 participants testing a Web application designed by applying a set of criteria for stimulating various emotions. In particular, we considered six emotions (hate, anxiety, boredom, fun, serenity, love), and for each of them a specific set of design criteria was exploited. The purpose of the study was to reach a better understanding regarding what design techniques are most important to stimulate each emotion. We report on the results obtained and discuss their implications. Such results can inform the development of guidelines for Web applications able to stimulate users’ emotions.	color;electroencephalography;eye tracking;headset (audio);interaction;sensor;usability testing;user experience;web application;web design;world wide web	Giulio Mori;Fabio Paternò;Ferdinando Furci	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22701-6_12	human–computer interaction;knowledge management;web application;anxiety;computer science;boredom;web design	HCI	-58.00143311657613	-46.45306448113224	159441

We are designing a grocery shopping assistance device that strategically requests affordable and nutritious food donations that charitable organizations need to feed the homeless. We target grocery shoppers, since doing so allows us to leverage mass participation, as well as frequent and balanced community participation. This device employs persuasive technology to elicit emotions of empathy and alter the behavior of grocery shoppers to encourage them to donate. The device provides the shopper with an enhanced, personalized shopping experience making it appealing to use.	personalization;persuasive technology	Rajasee S. Rege;Jennifer L. Allen;Eric P.

There is little formal understanding of this process, but rather a large body of design lore and rules of thumb. We have taken a first step in improving understanding by identifying design patterns in first-person shooter (FPS) levels, providing cause-effect relationships between level design elements and gameplay. The next step is to validate this theory with a series of experiments that test the strength of these relationships. Analysis data collected from subjects can improve understanding and provide designers with scientifically verified tools for creating gameplay in FPS levels.	artificial intelligence;design pattern;experiment;floating point systems;level design	Kenneth Hullett	2010		10.1145/1822348.1822387	game design;software design pattern;simulation;level design;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;design pattern;rule of thumb;statistics;data collection	HCI	-59.38788413516288	-46.770631911932426	161018
9e64bb4c144b76d5e8eefe6cb24df2254bccd2f9	fontmatcher: font image paring for harmonious digital graphic design		One of the important aspects in graphic design is choosing the font of the caption that matches aesthetically the associated image. To obtain a good match, users would exhaustively examine a long font list requiring them a substantial effort. This paper presents FontMatcher, which supports users to design digital graphic works harmoniously pairing fonts with an image. The system provides three features, recommendation, explaination and feedback. If a warm feeling image is given as input, the system recommends warm feeling fonts, and then explains what is the distinguishing features of the recommendation, e.g. a cursive shape. Users can also provide feedback to find fonts which correspond to their intention. Our evaluation results show that the recommended fonts scored better than selected fonts by novices and provides competing results with the ones chosen by experienced graphic designers. The system also provides explanations that help increasing the reliability of the recommended results.	feedback	Saemi Choi;Kiyoharu Aizawa;Nicu Sebe	2018		10.1145/3172944.3173001	computer science;font;multimedia;graphic design;human–computer interaction;cursive;feeling;associated image	HCI	-60.068665174570995	-47.8948088823644	162161
02789505b952d17d98f924200c2fc5e1a15b6b8c	towards understanding enjoyment and flow in information visualization		Traditionally, evaluation studies in information visualization have measured effectiveness by assessing performance time and accuracy. More recently, there has been a concerted effort to understand aspects beyond time and errors. In this paper we study enjoyment, which, while arguably not the primary goal of visualization, has been shown to impact performance and memorability. Different models of enjoyment have been proposed in other fields; yet there is no standard approach to evaluate and measure enjoyment in visualization. In this paper we attempt to relate the flow model of Csikszentmihalyi to Munzner’s nested model of visualization evaluation and previous work in the area. We suggest that, even though previous papers tackled individual elements of flow, in order to understand what specifically makes a visualization enjoyable, it might be necessary to measure specific elements in particular ways.	immersion (virtual reality);information visualization;scientific visualization	Bahador Saket;Carlos Eduardo Scheidegger;Stephen G.

The StudentLife continuous sensing app assesses the day-to-day and week-by-week impact of workload on stress, sleep, activity, mood, sociability, mental well-being and academic performance of a single class of 48 students across a 10 week term at Dartmouth College using Android phones. Results from the StudentLife study show a number of significant correlations between the automatic objective sensor data from smartphones and mental health and educational outcomes of the student body. We also identify a Dartmouth term lifecycle in the data that shows students start the term with high positive affect and conversation levels, low stress, and healthy sleep and daily activity patterns. As the term progresses and the workload increases, stress appreciably rises while positive affect, sleep, conversation and activity drops off. The StudentLife dataset is publicly available on the web.	android;sleep mode;smartphone	Rui Wang;Fanglin Chen;Zhenyu Chen;Tianxing Li;Gabriella M.

The aim of this study is to understand the performance of a handball goalkeeper, not only by the results of their own actions, but by integrating in the model the interactive actions between goalkeeper and defenders. The requirements of observational methodology are observed to gather data and we used sequential analysis and polar coordinates techniques to analyze data. The data are gathered from a natural environment where players have their behaviors, i.e., from handball matches in high level competitions context. Using an observational tool specially created and validated by an expert panel, the data was registered in a sequential way to make possible the sequential analysis with lags, prospective and retrospectively made.  The results show the goalkeeper performance is significantly associated with defenders actions.	high-level programming language;prospective search;requirement	João Prudente;Júlio Garganta;María Teresa Anguera	2010		10.1145/1931344.1931385	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-57.15722878343707	-46.65609255370915	164507

e00931160d0c9d5cd9a0f9e54b6c1f2b84d15915	an empirical evaluation of a persuasive mobile interface: a case study in the sapiens project		The use of smartphone technology is now ubiquitous as they become part of people's day-to-day lives. Mobile apps have been explored in a number of use cases including medical, education, entertainment - to cite a few. A growing number of mobile interfaces are now designed to be persuasive with respect to the Fogg Behaviour Model (FBM). This work carried out a structured user survey to evaluate the effectiveness of a persuasive interface in a smartphone energy setting. The mobile phone app brings awareness of energy consumption and help engaging with users towards good practices for electricity cost savings. In this study it was possible to evaluate the level of communication obtained between interface and users of the persuasive technology, being possible to verify items to be optimized in the interface design.

The final design is a tradeoff between the owner's personal idea and the web developer's perception of what he wants. In this paper, we have proposed a new model called WLDM (Web layout design model) to cover the important components of interface design. There are three components in the WLDM, including structure, content and visual. We have selected three features for structure, two for content, and three for visual component. Thereafter, we have made a dataset using 1088 most visited web sites. Finally, applying K-means algorithm, we have clustered this dataset. According to our result, six clusters were identified. Considering WLDM, web layout designer have a blueprint to cover areas of research related to this issue. The result of this clustering can be used for recommender systems to map owner groups, which have different attitude.	categorization	Amin Rasooli;Fattaneh Taghiyareh;Peter Forbrig	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21619-0_63	web service;layout;web mining;web modeling;data web;web analytics;web mapping;web design;human–computer interaction;computer science;web navigation;social semantic web;data mining;personalization;cluster analysis;web intelligence;user interface;world wide web;web design program;adaptation	HCI	-59.62778801125113	-47.28622244726426	166709

Though numerous studies have been performed on various issues of the Internet shopping mall, some research issues relating to the user interface of VR (virtual reality) shopping malls still await further empirical investigation. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the user interface of the VR shopping mall positively affects customer satisfaction in comparison with the ordinary shopping mall. For this purpose, we developed a prototype of the VR shopping mall for which the user interface consists of both 3D graphics and an avatar, using it as an experimental medium. 102 valid questionnaires were gathered from active student users of the ordinary shopping mall, and two research hypotheses were then tested to prove whether the three explanatory variables such as convenience, enjoyment, quality assurance improve in the VR shopping mall, and whether customer satisfaction is also significantly enhanced in the VR shopping mall in comparison with the ordinary shopping mall. Additionally, we conducted the PLS (partial least square) analysis to test whether the customer satisfaction is explained significantly by the three explanatory variables or not.	virtual reality	Kun Chang Lee;Namho Chung	2008	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2007.01.018	client;quality assurance;customer;simulation;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;virtual reality;customer satisfaction;user interface;affect	Visualization	-60.880480860467	-49.191045134281865	166770
ddc051ca9f165ef00cbeee21660a5c4bdcf1199c	a systematic review of the potential application of virtual reality within a user pre-occupancy evaluation		This research aims to discover the potential applications of virtual reality within a user pre-occupancy evaluation. The capability of the VR creates detailed observations, a feeling of immersion, an accurate behaviour measure‐ ment and systematic environmental manipulations, which can be controlled in the laboratory. However, previous studies seem to have paid little attention to specific clients when suggesting the most suitable VR approach at the evaluation stage. Moreover, few studies have investigated the use of VR in supporting designers in best practice, and only a limited number of studies focus on the design evalu‐ ation from a user’s perspective. A systematic literature review is therefore conducted in this study, which focuses on end-user participation. The purpose of this is to explore the extent to which VR is used and to find potential research directions for further studies. The results indicate that VR is a useful aid in a preoccupancy evaluation which is acceptable and reliable for users.	best practice;experience;human reliability;immersion (virtual reality);systematic review;virtual reality	Kevin C.

Although previous research has identified web accessibility influences on website effectiveness, the evaluation of the relative importance of web accessibility on software-as-a-service (SaaS) e-commerce platform has not been empirically determined. This study evaluates the web accessibility of SaaS e-commerce platform websites. The web accessibility features from the cloud accessibility taxonomy framework were evaluated for people with disabilities such as sensory (hearing and vision), motor (limited use of hands) and cognitive (language and learning disabilities) impairments. We conducted an expert evaluation using Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The results show Shopify cloud-based e-commerce platform has a high number of web accessibility features from the proposed cloud accessibility framework followed by 3dCart, BigCommerce, Volusion, and WooCommerce.	cloud computing;e-commerce;software as a service;user interface;web accessibility;woocommerce;world wide web	Osama Sohaib;Mohsen Naderpour;Walayat Hussain	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491621	e-commerce;machine learning;web accessibility;human–computer interaction;artificial intelligence;topsis;computer science;software as a service;cloud computing;cognition;user interface	Web+IR	-58.198160060363826	-48.468858154827586	167165
46dd93f1760a593575162209d25de391e1fdbd09	understanding the factors influencing user experience in social question and answer services		Introduction. The popularity of social question and answer sites has made it an important and convenient source for obtaining knowledge. This study quantifies how three different system characteristics (interface design, interaction and answer quality) affect users' perceptions (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment), which in turn alter the perceived user experience. Method. Using an online survey, this study investigated the experience of using a leading Chinese site, Baidu Knows. The study received 218 validated responses which were used to test the research model. Analysis. Structural equation modelling technique was used to evaluate the hypothesised research framework. Results. The results show that the influences of the system characteristics (interface design, interaction and answer quality) on user experience are well mediated by user perceptions of usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment. Additionally, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have direct and significant influences on user experience. Against expectations, perceived ease of use is found to have no significant direct effect on user experience, but have an indirect effect mediated through perceived usefulness. Conclusion. Use experience is mainly determined by user perceptions about its usefulness,the ease of use and the enjoyment of using the social question and answer sites, which are derived from their evaluation in relation to specific service features. By identifying these service features and quantifying how they affect user experience, a number of practical suggestions for service design have been made to help social question and answer sites managers improve their customers' user experience, e.g. offering more attractive rewards and adding various entertainment activities to motivate users to actively participate in knowledge sharing and innovation.	structural equation modeling;usability;user experience;user interface design	Shengli Deng;Yuling Fang;Yong Liu;Hongxiu Li	2015	Inf.

A component factor in satisfaction is perceived privacy. Current guidelines aimed at improving accessibility may impact users perceptions of privacy. The aim of this study was to explore whether different screen sizes affect users’ perceptions of privacy. Also, if partitioning around screens influences privacy perceptions. An opportunity sample of 60 participants took part in the study. The results that revealed 1200 screens were perceived as more private by users than 15 and 1700 screens. Adding privacy partitions improved user’s perceptions of privacy on the 12 and 1500 screens but not on the 1700. These findings provide evidence that slight changes in the physical design of systems can increase users’ perceived levels of privacy and therefore satisfaction. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

While software engineering methodologies have matured to handle non-functional requirements such as usability, what has not been investigated fully is the emotional needs of people. That is, what do users want to feel, and how do they feel about a system? In this paper, we argue that these emotional desires should be treated as first-class citizens in software engineering methodology, and present preliminary work on including emotions in requirements models using emotional goals. We evaluate these models both with a controlled user study, and on a case study of emergency systems for older people. The results of the controlled user study indicate that people are comfortable interpreting and modifying our models, and view the inclusion of emotions as first-class entities as a positive step in software engineering. The results of our case study indicate that current emergency systems fail to address the emotional needs their users, leading to low adoption and low usage.

However, these methods have not yet been applied to casual video games. From a development point of view, games developed in the casual sector of the games industry are characterized by very short production cycles which make them ill-suited for complex and lengthy psychophysiological testing regimes.  This paper discusses some methodological innovations that lead to the application of psychophysiological measurements to enhance the design of a commercially released casual game for the Apple iPad, called 'Gua-Le-Ni'; or, The Horrendous Parade'. The game was tested in different stages of its development to dry-run a cycle of design improvements derived from psychophysiological data. The tests looked at the correlation between stress levels and the contraction of facial muscles with in-game performance in order to establish whether 'Gua-Le-Ni' offered the cognitive challenge, the learning curve, and the enjoyment the designers had in mind for this product. In this paper, we discuss the changes that were made to the game and the data-analysis that led to these changes.	dry run (testing);point of view (computer hardware company);production (computer science);virtual world;ipad;ipod	Stefano Gualeni;Dirk P.

In this paper, we review the interpretations of current eye-movement metrics across several usability and HCI studies. We found that the existing eye-tracking metrics and their associated interpretations do not consider cross-platform usability (CPU) aspects. Therefore, taking into consideration the characteristics of user interaction with Multiple User Interfaces (MUIs), a usability-engineering model, which is called Eye Tracking Measurement and Analysis model for Cross-Platform Usability (CPU-EMA), has been developed. This model decomposed eye-tracking metrics for cross-platform usability into four high-level metrics, namely, cross-platform fixation, saccade, scanpath and gaze. The high-level metrics were further decomposed into low-level metrics with possible interpretations for cross-platform usability. The model also provided procedures for measuring and analysing cross-platform usability using eye-movement data.	central processing unit;eye tracking;high- and low-level;human–computer interaction;usability engineering;user interface	Khalid Majrashi;Margaret Hamilton;Alexandra L.

The result has been the establishment of principles and guidelines that direct user interface designers (Marcus, 1995; Mayhew, 1992; Shneiderman, 1992). However, little work has been reported about the impact of culture and language on the way users learn and interact with computer interfaces (Sukaviriya & Moran, 1990). The importance of culture in the design of interfaces has been stressed by many researchers (Fernandes, 1995; Marcus, 1993; Nielsen, 1990; Russo & Boor, 1993; Shneiderman, 1992). The nature of the problem may be illustrated by viewing the newspaper clippings in Figure 1. An important cultural issue depicted in Figure 1 is the flow (or orientation) of the words, resulting in different scanning patterns as the reader progresses through the article. Nielsen (1990) stated that when the scanning patterns of users are different between languages, the mental models of users will be inadequate to handle the direct translations of interfaces. Russo and Boor (1993) developed an extensive cross-cultural checklist of issues, including flow – that is, the intrinsic reading and writing directions of the language. However, most commercial software packages have concentrated mainly on the first two items of the Russo and Boor checklist (text and formats), possibly as a result of the scarcity of information with respect to flow, symbols, and images. Shneiderman (1992) highlighted this aspect when he wrote, “little is known about computer users from different cultures, but designers are regularly called to make designs for other languages and cultures” (p. 26). Another reason, cited by Fernandes (1995), is that “many software firms believe Effectiveness of Menu Orientation in Chinese	commercial software;de boor's algorithm;mental model;user (computing);user interface design;window clippings	Heloisa Martins Shih;Ravindra S.

To render information technologies universally accessible, researchers must have at their disposal an accurate and reliable user model. Through the use of the conceptual framework presented here, accurate assumptions can be generated from knowledge of an individual’s impairments, and functional abilities to influence the creation of a user profile. Ultimately, user profiles serve as a vital attribute of user models applied to the design of technology in an effort to achieve universal access.	computer accessibility;information system;user experience;user profile	Julie A.

Two different versions of the service were evaluated using a Wizard of Oz methodology. The first was a non-metaphor standard service with numbered menu options. The second was a service based on an office filing system metaphor, with different metaphor-related menu options at each level. User performance and attitudes to the services were recorded over a six week period, and post-trial interviews conducted. Results showed that the interface metaphor improved participants' performance compared to the standard service, but had no effect on attitudes. Context of use did not affect the usability of the services, which supports their use for mobile interaction. Visualisation of the metaphor-based service significantly affected participants' attitudes, suggesting an additional benefit of using interface metaphor for the design of speech-based mobile phone services.	interface metaphor;usability	Mark Howell;Steve Love;Mark Turner	2005	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/01449290512331319058	simulation;visualization;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;operating system;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-60.6420295661447	-49.057794575234595	174333

This allows improvements in diagnosis and treatment of patients. For the patient, this technology offers benefits and further potential in therapy, rehabilitation and diagnosis, and explanation. Applications across the whole range of functions that affect the health sector from the physician, the medical student, to the patients are possible. However, the quality of the work of medical professionals is considerably influenced by both usefulness and usability of technology. Consequently, key issues in developing such applications are the tracking methodology, the display technology and most of all ensuring good usability. There have been several research groups who extended the state of the art in employing these technologies in the medical domain. However, only a few are addressing issues of Human-Computer Interaction, Interaction Design, and Usability Engineering. This paper provides a brief overview over the history and the most recent developments in this domain with a special focus on issues of user-centered development.

1ea7327ff32577b98e7e67df73484a23fe960488	exploring the relationship between eye movements and pupillary response from formative user experience research		Measurement of eye physiology is an increasingly utilized tool in studying the usability of digital products. Measures include fixation counts and fixation duration, both indicators of attention, as well as pupillometry, a measure known to correlate with workload and arousal. Although most eye-tracking systems collect pupillometry data, its utility has yet to be fully realized in usability testing. In particular, it is still unclear whether the measure provides additional insight into the user experience over and above that provided by traditional eye-movement measures. The present study seeks to examine the relationship between pupillary response and fixation in the context of a usability task. Specifically, we use data from a formative user experience research study to explore whether, and under which conditions, fixation measures and pupillary response measures correlate. A better understanding of the relationship will aid practitioners in the interpretation of pupillometry data.	user experience	Jonathan Strohl;Joseph Luchman;James Khun;Edward Pierce;Kyle Andrews	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40250-5_45	psychology;computer vision;simulation;social psychology	HCI	-58.091800513485246	-46.58778720570184	175555
0bae8941899469ebe901fb8030a4974de6d8ae0d	evaluation of tablet apps to encourage social interaction in children with autism spectrum disorders	app;autism;social skills;tablet	The increasing rates of diagnosis for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have brought unprecedented attention to these conditions. Interventions during childhood can increase the likelihood of independent living later in life, but most adults with ASDs who benefited from early intervention do not live independently. There is a need for novel therapies and interventions that can help children with ASDs develop the social skills necessary to live independently. Since the launch of the iPad, there has been a great deal of excitement in the autism community about multitouch tablets and their possible use in interventions. There are hundreds of apps listed as possibly helping children with ASDs, yet there is little empirical evidence that any of them have positive effects. In this paper we present a study on the use of a set of apps from Open Autism Software at an afterschool program for children with ASDs. The apps are designed to naturally encourage positive social interactions through creative, expressive, and collaborative activities. The study compared activities conducted with the apps to similar activities conducted without the apps. We video recorded the activities, and coded children's behavior. We found that during the study children spoke more sentences, had more verbal interactions, and were more physically engaged with the activities when using the apps. We also found that children made more supportive comments during activities conducted with two of the apps. The results suggest the approach to using apps evaluated in this paper can increase positive social interactions in children with ASDs.	interaction;multi-touch;spectrum analyzer;tablet computer;ipad	Juan Pablo Hourcade;Stacy R.

84a59a76e81bde7aececec54da7d26f5be7d5010	seamless evaluation integration into ids educational games		Serious games have recently enjoyed unprecedented interest among researchers. Despite the fact that the main focus of this domain remains on player entertainment and engagement, serious games have established themselves as an alternative educational paradigm. However, little interest has been given to investigating methods for the assessment of their effectiveness. Game evaluation focus remains on investigating usability and technical aspects. Those attempting to evaluate the educational impact typically rely on traditional questionnaires that typically negatively affecting user immersion and the overall game enjoyment. Among game genres, Interactive Digital Storytelling (IDS) is a fast growing genre that merges computer games, multimedia and cinematic storytelling with entertaining education. Like any other teaching intervention, educational IDS’s have to be evaluated against a defined set of Learning Objectives (LOs). In this paper we present a User-Centred Seamless Evaluation Framework for IDS games and describe the algorithm for the integration of knowledge assessment to measure knowledge improvement against given LOs without affecting player enjoyment. We implement this algorithm in an educational game and show that the framework has been perceived by the majority of the players as a positive enhancement to the game, 94% of the participants reported preferring this form of assessment as opposed to the more “traditional” methods. Statistically significant knowledge improvements were obtained after the game play.	algorithm;immersion (virtual reality);interactivity;pc game;programming paradigm;seamless3d;usability	Andreea Molnar;Patty Kostkova	2013			simulation;digital storytelling;multimedia;immersion (virtual reality);entertainment;computer science;usability;video game development;storytelling;game mechanics;game developer	HCI	-61.55499456991939	-45.59288428838619	176416

Our system, CARE, will analyse the content of their messages and extract the emotions they are charged with, both in terms of strength (arousal) and valence (negative or positive). Their effects will be translated visually in forms suitable for the different age groups. A positive reinforcement policy will be in place where good behaviour results in awards and popularity among a restricted circle of friends. Finally a simple and cheap wearable device will be offered to young persons willing to be alerted in case they get into an aggressive mood so to raise their awareness and help control themselves better.	experience;feedback;library (computing);public library;regret (decision theory);wearable technology	Monica Landoni;Anton Fedosov;Evangelos Niforatos	2017		10.1145/3078072.3105877	aggressive mood;circle of friends;reinforcement;popularity;social psychology;psychology	HCI	-58.33337542744505	-50.76370989878796	176458

e7d8fd800f8b28212b86f3253aa9b6b204664981	an evaluation of an enhanced model driven approach for computer game creation		Various game authoring tools have been used to ease the game creation. However, these pre-defined tools may not be suitable for some emerging domains. We proposed an approach (GCCT) to create tools for certain domains first, and then create games with these tools. GCCT is based on the Model Driven Development (MDD) approach which has been successfully applied in many domains to fulfill similar requirements. But MDD also has drawbacks and as a result, persons often have concerns to adopt MDD. To alleviate this, some enhancements were made in GCCT and a user survey was performed to probe the user attitude towards this enhanced MDD approach. 46 persons responded to the survey and the result indicated that in general, GCCT was useful and easy to use. The participants intended to use GCCT primarily because they thought that GCCT was useful. Users’ familiarity with computer games and MDD did not have a strong impact on users’ understanding and adoption of GCCT.	pc game	Hong Guo;Shang Gao;John Krogstie;Hallvard Trætteberg	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19237-6_32	systems engineering;domain-specific modeling;simulation;information system;engineering	DB	-61.62249799149085	-45.924323616787596	177596

When the user smiles, both a photo and a screenshot are recorded and saved to the user's profile for later review. Based on positive psychology research, we hypothesize that the act of reviewing content that led to smiles will improve positive affect, and consequently, overall wellbeing. We conducted a preliminary user study to test this hypothesis, as well as to gather feedback on the initial design.	algorithm;prototype;screenshot;simplified molecular-input line-entry system;usability testing;webcam	Natasha Jaques;Weixuan 'Vincent' Chen;Rosalind W.

d923f647f0a4dfcb0486a63955dac0dfb06528d1	improving the failure understanding in embedded systems through interactive visual support: an evaluation story		Effectively analyzing failure mechanisms is critical for ensuring safety and reliability aspects in embedded systems. This requires close collaborations between the system engineers who design the system and the safety experts who analyze the failures. To support this process, we present an interactive visual environment, called ESSAVis++, that helps in extracting the required safety information about the failure mechanisms in the underlying embedded system. In this paper, we focus mainly on the conducted user evaluation study to compare between ESSAVis++ and ESSaRel (a tool used in industry) in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and user acceptance. The goal was to determine the suitability and effectiveness of a common interactive visual environment that would be used by the system engineers and safety experts during the safety analysis process in embedded systems. Results indicate an increase in participants’ efficiency and accuracy levels using the ESSAVis++ platform, due to the visual support and provided interaction options. We also observed a high acceptance rate among the participants towards ESSAVis++, mainly due to its intuitive visualizations.	computer graphics;davide sangiorgi;embedded system;failure cause;human–computer interaction;interaction technique;interactivity;steiner tree problem;usability testing	Ragaad AlTarawneh;Shah Rukh Humayoun;Achim Ebert;Peter Liggesmeyer	2016				HCI	-61.32291580605683	-50.20028416256442	177835

In this paper, we investigate mobility of college students in campus during their full life cycle and find the demographic differences on the predictability of human mobility. We explore an extensive consuming record data set collected from a college campus. Specifically, our data set includes over 15 million consuming logs gathered from 4,741 students (with demographic information) from 2013 to 2016. We present and analyze the evolving patterns of mobility entropy by ages, academic majors, and genders. We find that entropy decreases with age increasing and entropy grouped by genders follows different distributions, which is opposite to previous studies. Our findings will supply novel insights in human mobility research and provide possible support for wireless networking design in campus.	entropy (information theory)	Lu Liu;Sihai Zhang;Wuyang Zhou	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422657	wireless network;computer network;data science;wireless sensor network;predictability;wireless;computer science;urban planning	Mobile	-60.55113566614137	-51.72430352464415	177876

The known problems of text entry can be particularly acute for older adults due to physical and cognitive issues associated with ageing. In a study of mobile text entry the authors employed a variety of participatory design and formal comparative study techniques in order to explore the requirements of this group of users and to discover the key differences in texting activity between them and younger users of mobile devices. They report on the findings of a lab study of texting behaviour of older adults. The authors’ findings indicate differences in attitudes to texting styles and tasks between older and younger adults. They also identify some differences in typing behaviour and reflect on methods.

8ade287d0cd7e53e6c4e6e51b7edd3a3e87ade37	haptichem: haptic and visual support in interactions with the microscopic world		Haptic technologies provide physical sensations in the inter- action with a computing system, by exploiting the human sense of touch and by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user hands or body. Considering their features, they can be a useful tool in life-science teach- ing, especially when molecules are involved. For this purpose, a frame- work composed of an haptic device and a visual interface for molecular exploration has been developed to simulate molecular and intermolecu- lar interactions . Furthermore, this work evaluates the visual and haptic tool for molecular exploration in a didactic context, performing tests and interviews with students. The final aim is to properly develop the features of the tool, in order to make it suitable for the introduction in chemistry education. Preliminary results show positive and effective re- sponses and learning gains from the tasks. It has also been noticed that the use of such an innovative instrument raises the interest of students in the learning process, which is one of the main benefits of the haptic device.	haptic technology;interaction	Elisa Magnanelli;Gianluca Brero;Rosa Virginia Espinoza Garnier;Giacomo Mazzoletti;Alessandro Maria Rizzi;Sara Comai	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07485-6_8	stereotaxy;computer vision;simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-56.55405895136843	-49.89562145184954	179014

Operational specifications exemplifying their empirical existence are needed to understand where and how players affect content, structures, process or outcomes during interaction. This article presents a taxonomy of parameters influencing interaction. In it are identified (a) game aspects in which the player feels agency, and (b) game mechanisms that encourage that feeling. Such a taxonomy is useful for (i) game designers considering where and how to incorporate user input and input triggers, and (ii) evaluating the quality of interaction, given that players judge game quality partly on the extent to which their agency is enabled or inhibited. The taxonomy builds on the results of a series of focus-group studies analyzing selected commercial narrative role-play and adventure games	emoticon;focus group;taxonomy (general)	Bride Mallon	2007	Computers in Entertainment	10.1145/1324198.1324202	game design;interaction;simulation;computer science;evaluation;game mechanics;focus group;game art design;agency;game developer;multimedia;narrative;adventure;game design document;interactivity;implementation	HCI	-57.255872179882445	-47.88826445224623	179418

Positional geometry of webpage objects (wireframe) is an important factor for determining the webpage aesthetics as shown in studies. In this paper, we propose a computational model for predicting webpage aesthetics based on the positional geometry. We have considered 13 features of positional geometry that affect aesthetics, as reported in literature. By varying these 13 features, we have designed 52 interfaces’ wireframes and rated them by 100 users in a 5 point rating scale. Our 1 dimensional ANOVA study on users’ rating shows, 9 out of the 13 features are important for webpage aesthetics. Based on these 9 features, we created a computational model for webpage aesthetics prediction. Our computational model works based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). To judge the efficacy of our model, we considered 10 popular webpages’ wireframes, and got them rated by 80 users. Experimental results show that our computational model can predict webpage aesthetics with an accuracy of 90%.	web page;wire-frame model	Ranjan Maity;Samit Bhattacharya	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67687-6_7	human–computer interaction;empirical research;support vector machine;web page;multimedia;computational model;aesthetics (quality);computer science;usability;geometry	Vision	-59.43243644172507	-47.251533793152404	182354

The first line of research focused on deriving changing cognitive state information from the patterns of data acquired from users with the goal of improving presentation of multimedia computer information. Detecting individual differences via performance and psychometric tools can be supplemented by using real-time physiological sensors such as eye tracking and pressure applied to a computer mouse. We describe a computer task that demonstrates how to identify cognitive state and discuss types of physiological and cognitive state measures and associated advantages and disadvantages. Adaptive information filtering is discussed as a model for using the physiological information to improve individual performance. In the second line of research we interviewed participants with disabilities in an engineering vocational training program about their needs and suggestions for assistive devices that incorporate biosensors.	assistive technology;computer mouse;eye tracking;information filtering system;multimedia computer;population;real-time locating system;sensor	Thanh Truc T.

Although images can be better for navigation purposes, there is a need to understand how these images should be designed to enhance users’ interaction with digital content for this particular group of people. The purpose of this study is to measure the useru0027s preference for image-type representation (Object, Action and Universe), within four different categories (music, movies, sports, games). The sample consisted of 20 individuals with intellectual disabilities, their ages ranging from 22 to 49 years old. The results showed that they preferred less complex images, namely object representative images, and that categories had no effect.	data (computing)	Tânia Rocha;Maximino Bessa;Rute Bastardo;Luís Magalhães	2018	Int.

74dc22ad313871c4b4d150515c83932a61360941	recommending social-interactive games for adults with autism spectrum disorders (asd)		Games play a significant role in modern society, since they affect people of all ages and all walks of life, whether it be socially or mentally, and have direct impacts on adults with autism. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by qualitative impairments in social relatedness and interaction, as well as difficulties in acquiring and using communication and language abilities. Adults with ASD often find it difficult to express and recognize emotions which makes it hard for them to interact with others socially. We have designed new interactive and collaborative games for autistic adults and developed a novel strategy to recommend games to them. Using modern computer vision and graphics techniques, we (i) track the player's speech rate, facial features, eye contact, audio communication, and emotional states, and (ii) foster their collaboration. These games are personalized and recommended to a user based on games interested to the user, besides the complexity of games at different levels according to the deficient level of the emotional understanding and social skills to which the user belongs. The objective of developing and recommending short-head (i.e., familiar) and long-tail (i.e., unfamiliar) games for adults with ASD is to enhance their social interacting skills with peers so that they can live a better life.	computer vision;graphics;interaction;long tail	Yiu-Kai Ng;Maria Soledad Pera	2018		10.1145/3240323.3240405	autism;recommender system;machine learning;cognitive psychology;asd;artificial intelligence;social relation;graphics;computer science;social skills;eye contact	HCI	-55.673591818276186	-48.35681788972337	184731

This study compares the quality of crowdsourcing with games and paid crowdsourcing for simple and complex annotation tasks in a controlled experiment. While no difference in quality was found for the simple task, paid contributors’ response quality was substantially lower than players’ quality for the complex task (92% vs. 78% average accuracy). Results suggest that crowdsourcing with games provides similar and potentially even higher response quality relative to paid crowdsourcing.	crowdsourcing;interaction	Markus Krause;René F.

Subjective assessments via surveys produce better results, but are harder to conduct considering the vast amount of friendships of OSN users. This work presents a framework for personalized surveys on relationships in OSNs, which follows a gamification approach. A Facebook game was developed, which was used to subjectively assess social influence and interpersonal trust based on models from psychology. The results show that it is possible to obtain subjective opinions and (limited) objective data about relationships with an OSN game. Also an implicit assessment of influence and trust with subcategory questions is feasible in this case.	social network game	Michael Seufert;Valentin Burger;Karl Lorey;Alexander Seith;Frank Loh;Phuoc Tran-Gia	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2016.06.056	psychology;computer science;knowledge management;software framework;trustworthy computing;social psychology	ECom	-57.205195375894434	-48.739762609606046	186661

Physical interfaces suffer from interaction complexities leading to usage difficulty and poor acceptance by the end-users. Meanwhile, the usability techniques focus on the overall usability issues while overlooking the in-depth physicality aspects of the interface and interaction. This study proposes a physicality-focused quantitative evaluation method to assist the embedded system developers in managing the interaction complexities of their products. The acceptance of the embedded system developers towards the proposed method was assessed by means of a user study. The results suggested their strong acceptance. The aim of this study is to re-emphasise the natural physical aspects of embedded system interfaces leading to intuitive interaction.	embedded system;fundamental interaction;interaction design;software engineering;usability testing	Mahmood Ashraf;Masitah Ghazali	2013		10.1145/2541016.2541047	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;evaluation	HCI	-60.74851978700711	-46.94923009142007	187368
20205b052231dc31bb60ed8ba68d0ca9dea4a04f	the finer the musician, the smaller the details: nimecraft under the microscope		Many digital musical instrument design frameworks have been proposed that are well suited for analysis and comparison. However, not all provide applicable design suggestions, especially where subtle, important details are concerned. Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a series of interviews to explore how violin makers “go beyond the obvious”, and how players perceive and describe subtle details of instrumental quality. We find that lutherie frameworks provide clear design methods, but are not enough to make a fine violin. Success comes after acquiring sufficient tacit knowledge, which enables detailed craft through subjective, empirical methods. Testing instruments for subtle qualities was suggested to be a different skill to playing. Whilst players are able to identify some specific details about instrumental quality by comparison, these are often not actionable, and important aspects of“sound and feeling” are much more difficult to describe. In the DMI domain, we introduce the term NIMEcraft to describe subtle differences between otherwise identical instruments and their underlying design processes, and consider how to improve the dissemination of NIMEcraft.	jaquet-droz automata;while	Jack Armitage;Fabio Morreale;Andrew P.

User experience is measured by using a framework which includes perceptual-attentive, cognitive-emotional and motivational constructs. They form four experiential dimensions; Physical presence, Emotional involvement, Situational involvement and Performance competence. Attitudes to new technology were measured by asking from the subjects how interested in new technology they were. Two types of computer games were played in two different displays. The results show the dependence of experiential dimensions on subjects attitudes towards new technology. Attitudes to new technology modify the expectations and beliefs, hence the motivation of the user. The results have relevance especially when considering the optimal target group of marketing computer games.	pc game;relevance;user experience	Heikki Särkelä;Jari Takatalo;Jeppe Komulainen;Göte Nyman;Jukka Häkkinen	2004		10.1145/1028014.1028069	attitude;user experience design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-57.74880944389408	-48.3621451981694	188122

However, instances in which robots have been effectively integrated into informal science learning events are rare, and data on participants' learning and engagement are even harder to find. We present the deployment of a new robotic fish controlled by an iDevice application at a series of informal science learning events. Visitors to the exhibit are offered a unique learning experience and can interact with the robotic fish through a range of control modalities, highlighting the principles of autonomy and remote operations. Data collected on visitor interactions with the application indicate a longer time usage for more interactive control modes with less autonomy. Moreover, survey data garnered after the interaction with the robots suggest that visitors are concerned about the environmental issue of marine pollution and they are eager to learn more. This platform can serve as the basis for systematically exploring the potential of robotics in informal science education by combining refined data collection with interactive control.	autonomy;hands-on computing;interaction;interactivity;robot;software deployment	Paul Phamduy;Catherine Milne;Mary Leou;Maurizio Porfiri	2015	IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine	10.1109/MRA.2015.2443991	simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;robot kinematics	Robotics	-55.61629859053099	-49.78989008889443	188327

This is realized by focusing on user groups. To enhance the usability of user interfaces, the development process is expanded by the personalization of user interfaces. Thus user preferences and their attributes e.g. individual differences concerning the structure of interfaces have to be examined for being able to develop appropriate interfaces for specific users. Different test methods to gain these preferences and attributes are described within this paper. The found structural preferences can be connected to the concept of time orientation: it classifies people in two different categories: polychrons and monochrons. The test results confirm that these characteristic are rather individual differences than intercultural variables.

These similarities suggest that genres can be used as a conceptual framework for examining design issues in video games, and for developing a deeper understanding of how the design process can be specialized for specific types of games. In this paper, we consider how genre relates to one aspect of design---the usability of games, which deals with players' ability to learn, control, and understand a game interface. We report results from a study where we coded usability problems in reviews of 108 commercial video games. The review set included 18 games from each of six major game genres. We statistically analyzed the problems from each genre, and found significant differences between many of the genres. We present usability profiles for each genre based on the problem distributions that we found. The profiles describe both common and infrequent problems in each genre and provide details on how they commonly occur in games. The profiles can be used to specialize usability evaluations by helping designers focus on common problems seen in games from each genre.	usability;user interface	David Pinelle;Nelson Wong;Tadeusz Stach	2008		10.1145/1496984.1497006	simulation;human–computer interaction;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;computer science;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;game developer;multimedia;heuristic evaluation	HCI	-59.232868385100154	-46.882565760786235	190034

Additionally, in conjunction with the concept of website complexities, the task-technology fit theory (TTF) is adopted to develop a research framework to understand the behaviors of the website users. It is expected that the lower the users’ perceptions of website complexities will result in higher perception of the fit between a website and the tasks that the users intend to accomplish via the use of the website, which, in turn, may lead to higher user satisfaction and intend to reuse the website. Additionally, Internet users’ levels of technology readiness, familiarity, and online task characteristics are expected to have a significant moderating effect on the relationships between website complexities and the perceived level of task-technology fit. The research results are expected to provide insights into the relationships among website complexities, user satisfaction, and intention to reuse the websites.	eye tracking;internet;test template framework;tracking system;usability;web design	Wei-Tsong Wang;Bin Wang;Yu-Ting Wei	2014			simulation;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-60.35990298528719	-46.16251987808302	190200

These in-depth interviews establish relations between product characteristics (attributes), user behaviors (consequences) and basic values and user goals. We carried out interviews with 24 respondents. We found that the entertainment of other people, the exchange of content, the desire to save time and strategies to influence one's mood are the main driving forces for multimedia usage. Those are strongly related to basic values like social recognition, pleasure and happiness as well as to ambition. It is shown that usability aspects, like an intuitive UI, are strongly related to the users' desire for being effective and ambitious. Summarizing, we report the method's applicability in the realm of (mobile) HCI."""	human–computer interaction;usability;user interface;value (ethics)	Michael Leitner;Peter Wolkerstorfer;Reinhard Sefelin;Manfred Tscheligi	2008		10.1145/1409240.1409259	user experience design;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-59.5810276215007	-45.19707204021829	191828
4e7e9d1772995b3aa620bfeb5bbe01ac62ccd9bb	behavioural biometric profiling and ambient intelligence		In many applications, the most interesting features that we may wish to discover, store and/or exploit in decision making,  concerning a human subject, involve the psychology at a variety of levels, of this subject. Parameters, ranging from enjoyment  to honesty, important to applications such as adaptive entertainment, through to intrusion detection, are commonly but subtly  manifested in an individual’s behaviour. As humans, we systematically exploit information gleaned from the observation of  others’ behaviour, often with astounding levels of success, proving the existence of immensely descriptive data in such observations.  Technical attempts to exploit the exact same information have been successful in much more focused and limited applications,  demonstrating that at least an initial level of access to this information lies within the capabilities of technology. As  a core problem, extraction of useful features from measurements of human behaviour is approached as a pattern recognition  problem. Behavioural biometrics may be used for verification, identification or miscellaneous types of classification, without  the difference between these applications amounting to a paradigm shift, although the technical difficulty of the problem  and the technological sophistication required may change significantly. A critical issue, however, is that such input data  cannot, in the general case, be filtered to support one application but not another, which raises even deeper ethical concerns  than usual. The total information that can be extracted from behavioural biometric measurements forms an especially rich profile  for the subject of the analysis. Since behaviour is easy to observe, many of these techniques are non-intrusive, i.e., the  subject may not even be aware of them. This leads us to a major current limitation of practical behavioural biometric systems:  their sensing capabilities. This is actually a volatile research issue: from camera and microphone installations to monitoring  PC users’ input device usage rhythms, better measuring capabilities can lead to much improved behavioural biometric systems.  There exists therefore a strong connection with the ambient intelligence vision, which creates the potential for highly advanced  applications – but also much more subversive threats.  	ambient intelligence;biometrics	Angelos Yannopoulos;Vassiliki Andronikou;Theodora A.

The project proposes to investigate the relationship between visual aesthetics and Web accessibility, with the aim of building a framework to guide the development of aesthetic accessible Web content. As a first step, a formative study was conducted to examine the relationship between visual aesthetics and Web accessibility from a technical perspective. Thirty Web pages that had previously been rated on various aspects of their visual appearance in a study by Michailidou et al. [20] were investigated. The visual aesthetic dimensions considered in their study were """"clean"""", """"clear"""", """"organised"""", """"beautiful"""", and """"interesting"""". In our study, all thirty Web pages were tested for accessibility using an automatic evaluation tool, """"Cynthia Says"""". Initial results show that Web pages which were previously agreed by participants to be visually clean, clear, and organised had lesser numbers of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 failures. This suggests that visually pleasing pages along these design dimensions may not pose a barrier to accessibility. The implications of our study and future research directions are discussed."""	mike lesser;web content accessibility guidelines;web accessibility;web page	Grace Mbipom	2009	ACM SIGACCESS	10.1145/1531930.1531939	web design;human–computer interaction;web standards;computer science;web accessibility;web page;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-60.57840933508288	-47.92617546317195	193250

Despite its importance in creating presence and improving visual screen elements, sound also plays an important role in providing additional information to a player when completing various game tasks. This preliminary study focuses on the use of informative sound in the popular multiplayer online battle arena game, Dota 2. Our initial results indicate that team performance improves with the use of sound. However, mixed results with individual performances were measured, with some individual performances better with sound and some better without sound.

634c442a86ee288b3ca458a940d0b036ce005410	quittylink: using smartphones for personal counseling to help people quit smoking		We present the design and evaluation of a smartphone app, QuittyLink, designed to help smokers reduce or stop smoking. Smoking cigarettes is a serious health risk and people who wish to quit often struggle to do so. It is well known that the most effective method of assisting smoking cessation is personal face-to-face counseling. However, this approach is only used by very few people wishing to quit for reasons such as inconvenience and personal shyness. In response to this we have created an app that provides personal counseling to users on their smartphone. The counseling content is authored by smoking cessation experts and is based on the user's personal data and recent actual smoking behaviors collected through the smartphone. We deployed the QuittyLink app with people in their everyday lives to study how personal counseling on mobile phones would influence their smoking behaviors. We found that both the personal counseling and the ability to visualize and reflect on their own self-tracked smoking behaviors helped them form strategies to improve their ability to quit.	effective method;mobile app;mobile phone;personally identifiable information;smartphone	Jeni Paay;Jesper Kjeldskov;Mikael B.

Much effort and resources are put into solving battery technology related issues and progress is made continuously. There remain however important matters that have not been equally discussed; the design of user interfaces and human-machine interaction (HMI) of EVs is one.  This paper seeks to examine a few of the issues regarding EV HMI through a study that evaluates two different concepts for an EV instrument cluster in order to develop knowledge on (i) what information is relevant to present to the driver of an EV and (ii) how that information should be presented; innovatively or in a more familiar way. Two consecutive user tests, according to a between-subject procedure, were used to test two concepts in a driving simulator. Ten participants, with little or no experience of driving an electric or a hybrid electric vehicle, tested each concept. The participants were asked to drive the EV simulator and to interact with the user interface while different events were triggered, designed so that the participants would experience several of the situations that might appear when driving an EV for a longer period of time. Data was gathered through objective measurements, e.g. time, number if errors etc., as well as through questionnaires and interviews  The results show that participants had problems understanding the EV specific information content independent of concepts, even though they considered the information shown to be the right one. Both concepts had advantages and disadvantages, most notably that participants expected the vehicle to work like a conventional car when the interface was traditional and that they felt insecure when the interface was innovative.  Some of the discovered problems can be attributed to the participants' lack of knowledge and useful mental concepts regarding electricity and batteries, which made understanding the information difficult. More research on how to support EV drivers through design of the HMI given these deficiencies is needed.	device driver;driving simulator;extended validation certificate;self-information;simulation;user interface	Helena Strömberg;Pontus Andersson;Susanne Almgren;Johan Ericsson;MariAnne Karlsson;Arne Nåbo	2011		10.1145/2381416.2381445	simulation;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management	HCI	-60.7830208934022	-51.225688455401034	196626

Has been noticed an absence of Brazilu0027s proper education regarding procedures for fires, evidencing the need for portable fire extinguishers to induce intuitive usage and to improve the usability by users. Were also explored ergonomic factors, such as effort to complete the task and useru0027s perception of discomfort. In order to simulate the emergency context, a usability test was applied with addition stress stimuli. The study allows to conclude that the portable fire extinguisher evaluated present a low level of intuitive use induction, revealing the need to state better standards from Brazilian authorities towards the label and handles of this product. This paper presents the importance of evaluating ergonomic and intuitive factors related to products required on emergency contexts. This study conducted in Brazil is the starting point for other research that explore the theme and aim to improve these devices, assisting designers to take into account aspects of intuitive use and ergonomic principles during the configuration of industrial products.	human factors and ergonomics;usability	Maria Lúcia L.
