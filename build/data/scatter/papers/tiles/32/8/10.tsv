However, personal informatics research is still a young multidisciplinary area of concern facing unrecognised methodological differences and offering unarticulated design challenges. In this review, we analyse how personal informatics has been approached so far using the Grounded Theory Literature Review method. We identify a (1) psychologically, (2) phenomenologically, and (3) humanistically informed stream and provide guidance on the design of future personal informatics systems by mapping out rising concerns and emerging research directions.	amiga reflections;human–computer interaction;informatics;quantified self;situated	Amid Ayobi;Paul Marshall;Anna L.

This article addresses how the use of portable digital cameras and the subsequent exploitation of personal photos as major user-generated content on the Internet have transformed the cultural meaning of framing, taking, displaying, compiling, and reviewing photographs. It especially focuses on how digital photographic practices have changed as people are increasingly choosing to carry digital cameras with them at all times and to compile their output on the Web, as well as how these practices have affected people's spatial experiences with and within the physical world. Based on qualitative interview data collected from nineteen Korean digital camera users, this study explores how personal digital photography, as a tool to register personal experiences in physical space as well as a currency for communicating in digital space, has affected people's sense of physical place and thus has contributed to the ongoing hybridization of physical and digital experiences.

Our aim in this study is to disentangle different flavours of fairness and to find out how children used each flavour to make sense of potentially complex behaviour. In order to achieve this, a spatial computer game was designed to enable children to examine the consequences of their attempts to make the game fair. The study investigates how 23 children, aged between 5.5 and 8 years, engaged in constructing a crucial part of a mechanism for a fair spatial lottery machine (microworld). In particular, the children tried to construct a fair game given a situation in which the key elements happened randomly. The children could select objects, determine their properties, and arrange their spatial layout in the machine. The study is based on task-based interviewing of children who were interacting with the computer game. The study shows that children have various cognitive resources for constructing a random fair environment. The spatial arrangement, the visualisation and the manipulations in the lottery machine allow us gain a view into the children’s thinking of the two central concepts, fairness and randomness. The paper reports on two main strategies by which the children attempted to achieve a balance in the lottery machine. One involves arranging the balls symmetrically and the other randomly. We characterize the nature of the thinking in these two strategies: the first we see as deterministic and the latter as stochastic, exploiting the random collisions of the ball. In this article we trace how the children’s thinking moved between these two perspectives.	fairness measure;pc game;randomness	Efthymia Paparistodemou;Richard Noss;Dave Pratt	2008	I. J.

In essence, we are attempting to make explicit the process by which many researchers implicitly design visualizations and urge for greater explicit collaborations between fields to improve the effectiveness of visualization design. This process is dependent on the application of cognitive psychology, art and architecture, domain experts, and target users. We discuss how such a wide and disparate group must work together in an integrated fashion within the design process. We lay out the process itself as well as typical design goals. Given the importance of perception, we highlight the impact of perception, and thus cognitive psychology, on the visual interpretation process.	architecture domain;cognitive science;correctness (computer science);knowledge base;mimo;requirement;self-organized criticality	Robert F.

Moreover, interactive generative systems can fit naturally into human design thinking and industrial design practice. This discussion is focused on aesthetic design fields like knitwear and graphic design, but is largely applicable to major branches of engineering. Human designers and generative systems have complementary abilities. Humans are extremely good at perceptual evaluation of designs, according to criteria that are extremely hard to program. As a result, they can provide fitness evaluations for evolutionary generative systems. They can also tailor the biases that generation systems use to reach useful solutions quickly. We discuss an application of these approaches: Kelly's evolutionary systems for color scheme design. Automatic design systems can work interactively with human designers by generating complete designs from partial specifications, that can then be used as starting points for designing by modification. We discuss an application of this approach: Eckert's garment shape design system.	generative systems;interactivity	Claudia M.

As interactive systems and their uses change, the nature of evaluation must change as well. In this paper, we outline the challenges our community needs to address to develop adequate methods for evaluating systems in modern (and future) use contexts. We begin by tracing how evaluation efforts have been shaped by a continuous adaptation to technological and cultural changes and conclude by discussing important research directions that will shape evaluation's future.	human–computer interaction	Craig M.

In the COSTART Project 1998-2003 an innovative approach to the study of technology-based art founded on practice-led research methods has been developed. The work centers on the practice of art making. In this paper, we report on the particular innovations associated with one of the residencies; that of Yasunao Tone, an artist who was awarded the 2002 Ars Electronica Golden Nica prize for Digital Music. Tone has been changing calligraphic characters into images, then the images into sounds.

7cc001085b6fe0ddaf6b8e27cd519c8e91520373	more than just logic tasks: new approaches to understanding reasoning	social and behavioral sciences	New Directions Reasoning research has long been associated with paper and pencil tasks in which peoples’ reasoning skills are judged against established normative conventions (e.g., Logic). In this way researchers have tried to assess the extent to which we can think rationally, and of course how we deviate from normative conventions. The “fruit flies” of this domain have been the Wason selection task (Wason, 1966), and Syllogistic reasoning tasks (Johnson-Laird, 1984). The field has advanced in helping us to understanding the influence of context on the kinds of inferences we tend to make, and we have gained significant insights into the kinds of situations in which our biased thinking is aligned with normative thinking and the situations in which it conflicts with it. While such gains have led to proposals that the underlying mechanisms that support reasoning are highly adaptive, outside of reasoning research, the most commonly known findings are from classic paper and pencil tasks. The field has significantly moved on and the range of empirical methods developed to examine reasoning behavior has broadened along with the empirical tools for measuring patterns in our inductive and deductive thinking. This symposium brings to the fore new pioneering research and findings with the aim of stimulating discussion on innovative methods that are currently used to shed new light on old issues (How biased are we? Is there a relationship between our intuitive and analytical thinking?). Moreover, the overview of these new approaches in the reasoning field will allow us to highlight the links with ongoing research in other fields (e.g., memory, cognitive control, general neuroscience) to the cognitive science community. This should help to boost much needed interdisciplinary research efforts. Moreover, the aim is to generate new insights into theoretical issues concerning the relationship between heuristic-based inferences and deliberative-based inferences, and the possible meta-cognitive processes thought to arbitrate between the two. The talks range from using priming techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electrodermal recordings (SCR), event-related potentials (ERP), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and memory probing through to incorporating clinical populations. Wim De Neys has been using fMRI, EEG, and SCR to examine bias detection during thinking, Taeko Tsujii’s work using rTMS is the first of its kind to use this method to examine brain regions associated with belief-biased reasoning. Magda Osman has pioneered the use of supraliminal and subliminal priming methods in reasoning research to uncover the rational status of people’s underlying reasoning behavior. Simon Handley’s developmental work has established a new line of research that has revealed the absence of belief biased reasoning in a clinical population, which in turn has helped to establish critical processes in non-clinical populations that show the bias.	cognition;cognitive science;computational thinking;erp;electroencephalography;heuristic;population;resonance;silicon controlled rectifier;subliminal channel;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Magda Osman;Wim De Neys	2011			psychology;verbal reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;social psychology	AI	-61.48735092547396	-31.17704352646804	157745

The design team experimented with various ways to include hearing-impaired children and their parents and teachers in this process. First, an inspiration phase was organized in which two field researchers used various ethnographic methods to gain a better understanding of hearing-impaired children. Next, the design team held two ideation sessions, which resulted in 13 concepts. After thorough evaluation of these concepts with all stakeholders involved, three concepts remained. One pedagogical concept was chosen to elaborate further on with the target group and is currently under development in a new research project. The paper ends with a series of recommendations for design teams focusing on hearing-impaired children.	conceptualization (information science)	Pieter Duysburgh;Karin Slegers;An Jacobs	2012		10.1145/2307096.2307135	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;communication	HCI	-62.7756880446555	-36.65053530484926	158197

The common Website editors just help to draw the intended layouts but the problem is to design the accurate Web layout according to the demand and latest trends and style. This approach is useful when the user has a specific layout already in mind and is familiar with the Web page layout principles as to what kinds of layouts are possible. It is intrinsically difficult for particularly those who have limited artistic and creative abilities to design good layout from scratch which is acceptable in every respect. An automated system is required that has ability to mine the layouts of the desired type of Websites. The designed system for """"Web layout mining (WLM)"""" helps to mine the most popular web-layouts from the Internet database and design a Web-layout that is near to acceptable and have all the marks and features of modern requirements.

The system allows a user to walk through a city and listen to texts that talk about the places the user is passing by, thus making possible a new way of experiencing place-bound literature in relation to place. The system also allows any user to write and share their own texts connected with places, exploring what it is to write locative literature. The sharing of old texts and usergenerated texts through the system is analysed and used to outline some categories of locative literature, unified under the concept of ‘poetically augmented reality’.	augmented reality;location-based game	Anders Sundnes Løvlie	2011	IJART	10.1504/IJART.2011.041479	design;cultural geography;computer science;multimedia;communication;management	HCI	-57.42746598328111	-34.25420134551001	159184

In the design community, tasks with these qualities are known as wicked problems. This paper frames composing for computer-based ensemble as a design task, shows how Buchanan’s four domains of design are present in the task, and discusses its wicked properties. The themes of visibility, risk, and embodiment, as formulated by Klemmer, are shown to be implicitly present in this design task. Composers are encouraged to address them explicitly and to take advantage of the practices of prototyping and iteration.	faceted classification;iteration;laptop;mobile phone;wicked	Luke Dahl	2012			human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-62.23162893713311	-36.873106181704564	159436

The heterogeneity with which they have been used in practice reflects how the method has proved elusive for many. Originators and commentators of probes have discussed misinterpretations of the method, highlighting the lack of accounts that describe in detail the design of probes and their use with participants. This paper discusses our particular use of Design Probes as directed craft objects that are both tools for design and tools for exploration across a number of projects, spanning a decade, centered on self-identity and personal significance. In offering an example of what a framework for probe design and use might look like, we attempt to address the identified lacuna, providing a synthetic account of probe design and use over an extended period and conceptualizing the relationship between the properties of probes and their use in design projects.	experience;file spanning;human–computer interaction;icebreaker;lexicon;materiality (digital text);openness;synthetic data;the void (virtual reality)	Jayne Wallace;John C.

The device allows performers to interactively accompany themselves through pushing, leaning on and bending steel wires. The design was guided by the unique needs of the solo-singer, explored through autobiographical design and material explorations, some on stage, and later tested by other singers. We discuss how designing for opera and for the stage requires extraordinary durability and how opera performances can change with a bodily-oriented instrument such as The Vocal Chorder. Through a designerly exploration, we arrived at a device that offered (1) a tool for singers to take control over the rhythmical pace and overall artistic and aesthetic outcome of their performances, (2) an enriched sense of embodiment between their voice and the overall performance; and (3) a means to empower opera singers on stage.	durability (database systems);interactivity;performance;structure of observed learning outcome	Carl Unander-Scharin;Åsa Unander-Scharin;Kristina Höök	2014		10.1145/2556288.2557050	empowerment;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;opera;multimedia	HCI	-58.50371444768996	-36.428678375119794	160264

Material programming would be a way for the interaction designer to better explore the dynamic potential of computational materials at hand and through that familiarity be able to compose more sophisticated and complex temporal forms in their designs. The contribution of the paper is an analysis of qualities that we find a material programming practice would and should support: designs grounded in material properties and experiences, embodied programming practice, real-time on-site explorations, and finally a reasonable level of complexity in couplings between input and output. We propose material programming knowing that the technology and materials are not entirely ready to support this practice yet, however, we are certain they will be and that the interaction design community will need to find new ways of relating to such computational materials.	computation;experience;input/output;interaction design;real-time transcription;software design pattern	Anna Vallgårda;Laurens Boer;Vasiliki Tsaknaki;Dag Svanæs	2016		10.1145/2971485.2971554	interaction;simulation;reactive programming;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-59.25289045840911	-36.61267660497127	160311

Explanations have at least three levels: the specific content, ideally critical junctures in change over time; a causal structure linking the changes; and a narrative structure that aids in organizing the material. Using route instructions and assembly instructions as examples, we analyze the techniques that diagrams, words, and gestures use to convey content, to provide causal links, and to provide a narrative structure. Effective explanations break the action into major steps, describe, illustrate, or demonstrate action and not just structure, and adopt user’s perspective. There are striking parallels in the ways these are expressed spontaneously. Explanations in Word, Diagram, and Gesture What constitutes an effective explanation? Explanations consist of the content to be explained, and a structure to explain it. The content should be decomposed into parts and links among the parts. The structure turns the content into a narrative, with a beginning, middle, and end. It sounds simpler than it is. Challenges include decomposing the content and composing the narrative. The implication is that the content and structure of an effective explanation is abstract, and can be expressed in different media. This is not to say that each medium is equally effective; on the contrary. The prototype explanation is a route, how to get from here to some other point. Close in line are explanations of doing the kinds of things necessary in daily lives. We have been studying how people design words, diagrams, and gesture in order to convey procedures to others, in particular, how to get from here to there, and how to assemble a simple object. These tasks were chosen because on the one hand, they are typical of the daily procedures people enact so readily performed by ordinary people and on the other hand, they are representative of a large class of things that people explain, including how to put things together, how things work, and how to operate things. The triple goals of the project are intertwined: to develop cognitive design principles for effective explanations; to reveal the underlying cognitive structure of devices, systems, and procedures; to uncover common semantics and syntax and pragmatics of these communication media. The paradigm capitalizes on the extensive experience people have had in communicating to each, other, natural user testing that refines the communications through successes and failures. Content of Explanations Routes. The skeleton of a route is paths and actions at landmarks (Denis, 1997). Analysis of productions of route maps and route descriptions has shown that a small number of elements is sufficient to create most routes, and that these elements can be combined according to simple rules for sequencing, much like language (Tversky and Lee, 1998, 1999). Moreover, these elements have parallel structure in language and in diagrams. The core consists of: straight and curved paths or expressions such as “go down” or “follow around”; T, L, and + intersections or expressions such as “turn”, “take a,” or “make a”; and landmarks or expressions such as names or descriptions. New work (Lozano and Tversky, in preparation) shows that gestures express the same elements and sequencing, and that, surprisingly, gestures may be more effective than words in conveying the information.	causal filter;diagram;gesture recognition;microsoft word for mac;mind map;organizing (structure);parallels desktop for mac;programming paradigm;prototype;user research	Barbara Tversky;Sandra C.

One of those is the multi-touch technology: without mouse and keyboard, the display recognizes simultaneous multiple fingers pressure from various users, unlike its precursor touchscreen which detects only one touch pressure. Like many other participative tools it has the problem to be used outside the entertainment domain. I consider multi-touch technology as a hyper-tool that enhances collaborative creativity for organizational innovation. Its features put aside the previous known interactions and permit a more natural and physical gesture-based communication. They also allow participative sessions where organizational actors can work together to create a common and shared interpretation of the real. Reviewing situated and contextual uses of multi-touch devices, like the CityWall and the Storytable cases, I propose a study perspective to start a close investigation of the artefact present and of the future affordances.	computer;interaction;multi-touch;situated;touchscreen	Roberto Cricrì	2008			affordance;entertainment;situated;multimedia;boundary object;creativity;gesture;aside;touchscreen;engineering	HCI	-57.67686416697023	-36.85173229588	161214

To examine this, I draw on ethnographic fieldwork at a high tech firm and focus on efforts to reinvent an email client. I explore how seeing work in and through trace data paints increasingly narrow and modular portraits of work, reframing the contours and potential of vision and visibility in the workplace.	contour line;email;field research;html element;human–computer interaction;noise shaping;tracing (software)	Christine T.

We present a preliminary analysis of design implications in the area of interaction design in the home.

These findings are taken almost as assumptions within the field. In summary, they argue that human activity is highly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized and that computational entities such as information sharing, roles, and social norms need to be similarly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized. However, current systems cannot fully support the social world uncovered by these findings. In this article I argue that there is an inherent gap between the social requirements of CSCW and its technical mechanisms. The social–technical gap is the divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically. Exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating this social–technical gap is the central challenge for CSCW as a field and one of the central problems for human–computer interaction. Indeed, merely attesting the continued centrality of this gap could be one of the important intellectual contributions of CSCW. I also argue that the challenge of the social–technical gap creates an opportunity to refocus CSCW.

Informatics should therefore be viewed as technical semiotics (or semiotics engineering). In particular, interaction between human and computer is characterized by features of communication, a sort of communication, however, that lacks decisive communicative features. It must be identi®ed as a process of pseudo-communication. Interaction is viewed as the coupling of two autonomous processes: a sign process (carried out by the human user) and a signal process (carried out by the computer). Software appears as a semiotic entity in a duplicate way: calculated and calculating, i.e. both result and agent of calculations. This dialectics characterizes the class of signs on the computer medium. Problems of software design (functionality and usability design) are speci®c problems of the coupling of sign and signal processes. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

126f6074b6c13a8d158dbe1d66df76f852fda437	multi-lifespan information system design in support of transitional justice: evolving situated design principles for the long(er) term		Human societies face some significant problems—such as those tied to limitations of the human psyche, to tears in the social fabric, and to slow-moving natural processes—that defy rapid solution. Correspondingly, information systems that help to address these problems also develop over long(er) periods of time. Yet contemporary research and industry information system design is held to increasingly ambitious project deadlines. Research that engages with long(er) term design processes from diverse perspectives and theoretical orientations is needed. Early efforts of this ilk in the human–computer interaction community can be found around domains such as conflict and postconflict situations, crisis informatics, collapse informatics, cultural heritage and sustainability. The work reported here joins this literature—in the context of recovering from genocide and the development of systems of transitional justice—and draws from the theoretical framing of multilifespan design. Specifically, we report on the first 8 years of a multi-lifespan information system design project—the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal—to support aspects of transitional justice in Rwanda. We offer a systematic presentation of the project’s design principles and explicate the development of those guiding design principles through our engagement with a set of nine design challenges. We provide design reflections that pertain to information systems for transitional justice, conducting multi-lifespan information system design under shifting socio-political and technical conditions, and engaging with value sensitive design. We conclude with our contributions and open questions.	amiga reflections;baton;disaster informatics;emoticon;framing (world wide web);human–computer interaction;information system;situated;software engineer;system migration;systems design;value sensitive design;vii	Batya Friedman;Lisa P.

However, what is not obvious is what this means and what social demands such cooperation may imply. To explore this is the intention of the paper. As a first step the paper performs an etymological analysis of the words telecooperation and telecoordination. Such an analysis indicates that cooperation happens when people engage in the production of a work as if ‘one mind or body’, where their activities fuse together in a way that makes the suggestion of separation seem incomprehensible. In the work they do not merely aim to achieve an outcome, they also ‘insert’ themselves ‘in’ the work in a way that makes it a human achievement rather than a mere product – this is cooperation as working-together. With this notion of cooperation in mind the paper then proceeds to analyse the social conditions for cooperation as working-together. It shows, using the work of Wittgenstein, that language is fundamental to cooperation and the sharing of knowledge – not language as a system for the exchange of information but language as a medium for the co-creation of a local way of doing, a local language, to capture the local distinctions that make a particular local activity significant and meaningful to the participants. The paper then proceeds to question this strong notion of cooperation. It argues that most cooperative activities tend not to conform with such stringent demands. The paper suggests that a cooperative problem is best viewed as a situation in which ambiguity is accepted as a structural element of the interaction. From this perspective the paper suggests that hermeneutics may be a productive way to understand the creation of shared interpretative spaces that makes mediated cooperation possible. The paper concludes with some implications for mediated cooperative work.	decision theory;ecology;ibm notes;interaction;mind;noise shaping;requirement;robotics;simulation;situated;socialization;structural element	Lucas D.

Some promising approaches in the recent past have attempted tackling the problem of evaluating adaptivity by “decomposing” and evaluating it in a “piece-wise” manner. Separating the evaluation of different aspects can help to identify problems in the adaptation process. This paper presents a framework that can be used to guide the “layered” evaluation of adaptive systems, and a set of formative methods that have been tailored or specially developed for the evaluation of adaptivity. The proposed framework unifies previous approaches in the literature and has already been used, in various guises, in recent research work. The presented methods are related to the layers in the framework and the stages in the development lifecycle of interactive systems. The paper also discusses practical issues surrounding the employment of the above, and provides a brief overview of complementary and alternative approaches in the literature.	adaptive system;endeavour (supercomputer);systems engineering	Alex Paramythis;Stephan Weibelzahl;Judith Masthoff	2010	User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction	10.1007/s11257-010-9082-4	design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;adaptive system;multimedia	HCI	-61.777320447462614	-37.07252310890245	166006

It is widely used in the areas of marketing, health and education. However, in production environments, it is a new concept. To be accepted in the industrial domain, it has to be seamlessly integrated in the regular work processes.  In this work we make the following contributions to the field of gamification in production: (1) we analyze the state of the art and introduce domain-specific requirements; (2) we present two implementations gamifying production based on alternative design approaches; (3) these are evaluated in a sheltered work organization. The comparative study focuses acceptance, motivation and perceived happiness.  The results reveal that a pyramid design showing each work process as a step on the way towards a cup at the top is strongly preferred to a more abstract approach where the processes are represented by a single circle and two bars.	gamification;requirement;user experience	Oliver Korn;Markus Funk;Albrecht Schmidt	2015		10.1145/2769493.2769549	augmented reality;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-58.88646915959958	-37.151740150530195	166149

Complexity increases because existing technologies are becoming smaller and cheaper and thus more ubiquitous, even as new I/O devices are invented. This complexity is increased by the task of integrating technologies into workplaces which we are recognizing as filled with existing customs and practices. Simultaneously, interaction design is becoming more diverse. Within CHI, it is well accepted that anthropologists, psychologists, and visual designers, as well as engineers and computer scientists, have roles to play in systems design. And as new technologies and application domains appear on the scene, the need for disciplines such as industrial and product design, architecture, interior design, music and film becomes evident. Another factor driving diversity is customization. As systems become increasingly customizable, more design is done in-house by MIS departments, outside consultants, or the end users. In many cases, these participants lack the time, resources, training or inclination to engage in research on the needs and practices of their users.	application domain;chi;complexity;computer scientist;input/output;interaction design;management information system;pattern language;systems design	Thomas Erickson;John C.

Gesture and speech are coexpressive, conveying this imagery and meaning simultaneously. Mathematics instruction and discourse typically involve two modes of communication: speech and graphical presentation. Our goal is to assist Individuals who are Blind or Severely Visually Impaired (IBSVI) to access such instruction/communication. We employ a haptic glove interface to furnish the IBSVI with awareness of the deictic gestures performed by the instructor over the graphic in conjunction with speech. We present a series of studies spanning two years where we show how our Haptic Deictic System (HDS) can support learning in inclusive classrooms where IBSVI receive instruction alongside sighted students. We discuss how the introduction of the HDS was advantageous to all parties: IBSVI, instructor, and sighted students. The HDS created more learning opportunities, increasing mutual understanding and promoting greater engagement.	file spanning;graphical user interface;haptic technology;holographic data storage;wired glove	Francis K.

These two communities use language in very different ways making it difficult to maintain a common understanding of terms such as interactive architecture. As a result, there is a need for the interaction research community to become familiar with the industry-standard language used in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industries. To this end, we propose a tutorial to aid in the understanding of this language in the specific area of glass facades and new architecture styles. Increasingly, transparent displays and glass are used in interactions research and it is natural to expect that some of this technology will be integrated into the architecture of future buildings. This not only provides HCI researchers with a foundation for collaboration but it also reveals some of the key customer needs that concern architects and may inspire future research.	expect;human–computer interaction;responsive architecture	Edward Tse	2016		10.1145/2992154.2996363	simulation;architectural engineering;engineering	HCI	-59.00788530422793	-35.242271027974795	167282

To illustrate the concept of spatial form I have chosen to analyze the mola web, a hypertext which is unique, though not abnormal, in the extremity of its link structure. One needs only think of the ubiquitous metaphor of the labyrinth in hypertext criticism [5] or of the recent attention given to spatial user interfaces [17] to see how dependent is the idea of hypertext on a spatial form.	emulator;hypertext;user interface	John Tolva	1996		10.1145/234828.234835	computer vision;hypertext;visual system;computer science;multimedia;user interface;world wide web;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-56.61569942804986	-31.465120172282706	167604

The full realization of the potential of the field must also include the craft and art of music composition. The author proposes examining techniques of sonification in a two-order framework: direct and procedural. The impact of new technologies and historical roots of that work argues that framing this broad topic should be in terms inclusive of scientific method and craftsmanship and art. The expressive use of sonic time-based data flows needs to be refined and expanded.

We present constructive visualization a new paradigm for the simple creation of flexible, dynamic visualizations. Constructive visualization is simple-in that the skills required to build and manipulate the visualizations are akin to kindergarten play; it is expressive in that one can build within the constraints of the chosen environment, and it also supports dynamics -- in that these constructed visualizations can be rebuilt and adjusted. We de- scribe the conceptual components and processes underlying constructive visualization, and present real-world examples to illustrate the utility of this approach. The constructive visualization approach builds on our inherent understanding and experience with physical building blocks, offering a model that enables non-experts to create entirely novel visualizations, and to engage with datasets in a manner that would not have otherwise been possible.	programming paradigm;scientific visualization	Samuel Huron;M.

1acd8fa0318fc1edd5699e25a44a3f4f36a3322c	analysing the playground: sensitizing concepts to inform systems that promote playful interaction	sensitizing concepts;playful interaction;research outputs;research publications;playground	Playful interaction in an important topic in HCI research, and there is an ongoing debate about the fundamental principles that underpin playful systems. This paper makes a contribution to this debate by outlining a set of sensitizing concepts which have emerged from an analysis of interaction in the playground; these help explain its appeal to children, and have been selected for their potential to inspire the design of future playful systems. These concepts have emerged from the analysis of material collected during a structured workshop which was organized by the authors, and which was attended by a group of experts. They have also been applied to the design of Breathless, a playful interactive system which has recently been deployed by the authors, and which represents an unusual evolution of the playground swing. The paper concludes with a number of reflections inspired by Breathless. These have been structured through the use of the concepts as an analytical tool. Author’s version.

It has previously been shown that the use of an interactive artifact cannot be understood in isolation, but artifacts must be understood as part of an artifact ecology, where artifacts influence the use of others. Understanding this interplay becomes more and more essential for interaction design as our artifact ecologies grow. This paper continues a recent discourse on artifact ecologies. Through interviews with iPhone users, we demonstrate that relationships between artifacts in artifact ecologies cannot be understood as static, instead they evolve dynamically over time. We provide activity theory-based concepts to explain these dynamics.	ecology;interaction design;iteration	Susanne Bødker;Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose	2012		10.1145/2399016.2399085	dynamics;simulation;activity theory;human–computer interaction;computer science	HCI	-59.16608452522335	-37.80827634361568	169554

With output devices such as computer displays providing a large number of colors, developers sometimes tend to build their visualization to be visually appealing, while forgetting the main goal of clear depiction of the underlying data. Visualization researchers have profited from findings in adjoining areas such as human vision and psychophysics which, combined with their own experience, enabled them to establish guidelines that might help practitioners to select appropriate color scales and adjust the associated color maps, for particular applications. This survey presents an overview on the subject of color scales by focusing on important guidelines, experimental research work and tools proposed to help non-expert users. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this early phase the immediacy and flexibility of traditional media are preferred over the possibilities that computer tools offer. This video presents ways in which a computer-supported sketching tool can improve support for a designer at those stages. Three scenarios each depict part of a designer's activities: discussing the brief with a client, travelling home in a train, and working in the designer's office. For each scenario, the video shows the strong points and limitations of traditional media, and indicates how current or near-future technology can improve the situation.	futures studies	Aldo Hoeben;Pieter Jan Stappers	2001		10.1145/634067.634187	simulation;industrial design;human–computer interaction;multimedia;design education;design brief	HCI	-60.796609188261044	-37.108913186258526	170313

It criticizes that its underlying term of Embodiment has not been defined sufficiently, and is, consequently, used inconsistently. It also argues that this circumstance is a problematic one.  It presents an attempt to provide more clarity to the theory of embodiment, as a basis for the practice of designing embodied interaction in Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). It proposes a purely structural approach, derived from Heidegger's works around 'Being and Time' [3].  Aspects and criteria of Embodiment (as which Heideggerian Dinglichkeit is interpreted) in the literature are reviewed in this work, and applied to the design practice of Embodied Interaction.	tangible user interface	Fabian Hemmert	2010		10.1145/1753846.1753881	human–computer interaction;computer science;theory	HCI	-60.39122624848735	-35.41174158741795	170860
7b3c1b247ba74d31007f2cec741cbcc7eb15f75a	on hopelessness and hope		In culture, and particularly in the creative professions, a profound dichotomy of hope and hopelessness has permeated discussions of project engagement and project work. At conferences, in client meetings, and over a beer or two, designers frequently and increasingly describe the rich potential to effect massive change and empower humanity in our work and in our jobs. This potential lies both in the nature of the work itself and also in the scope and scale of our influence. Designers have a large degree of control over the world around them. While this control may have a sense of delayed return—as products take months to land in the market—we can often trace both cultural and individual changes back to particular product introductions, feature changes, or even brand philosophies. Still, I see designers bemoan their ability to actually follow through on visionary promises; deliver products that work and act as intentioned; or even conceive of artifacts that will evoke a sense of desire, mystique, or intrigue. They may find themselves designing things they deem insignificant, or they may be working on significant problems but feel unable to effect enough change, or they may simply not have the appropriate skills to execute on the challenges of behavior and the larger issues of cultural change. Yet a number of individuals—a group that is small in number but significant in its contributions—have managed to deliver on projects broad and deep. They do act as renaissance individuals, and they do manage to tackle problems that are complex and whose solutions result in important contributions. In working with and observing these types of people, I see several commonalities. These designers are not focused on innovation. Their work may be described as innovative, but these individuals approach their work with a focused pragmatism that emphasizes appropriateness, not newness. They don’t strive to be as unique as possible. Instead, they observe their constraints and attempt to fulfill these constraints directly. These designers have a passion for details. All design work has both concept and detailed stages of development. Often, designers gravitate toward preliminary concept work because they find it gives them more freedom to explore. Yet design that seems to resonate on a behavioral level is detailed, nuanced, and crafted. This comes through relentless iteration, refinement, and patience. These designers are constantly reflective. Design is an intellectual activity, and while few of the designers I refer to here would actually call themselves intellectuals, they exhibit the sense of thought and reflection described by Donald Schön in The Reflective Practitioner. In a situation of complexity that requires order, Schön explains designers will constantly “engage in a conversation with the situation they are shaping... and if they are good designers, they will reflect-in-action on the situation’s back-talk” Above all, I see these designers expect to have a dramatically deep impact, rather than a broad one. Their expectation is to affect only the small, detailed, and critical aspects of the artifacts they design. They don’t speak of “designing experiences,” in some grandiose fashion, and they don’t describe their work as “end-to-end design” or “system thinking” or “affecting the experience of the end-to-end customer journey.” These designers are able to quickly prioritize problems, select those of most importance, and then, through a reflective, detailed, and extremely rigorous design process, create appropriate design solutions. I wonder if designers should refocus their efforts on the more mundane and detailed. Rather than emphasizing the “strategic, game changing” nature of their work, and rather than considering their role as “innovators” or those engaged in “delivering the brand promise,” designers might better focus on more humble, appropriate, and refined goals. Accept—quietly and implicitly—that your work will affect millions. Focus on the nuances and details of the craft itself, and on your capacity to engage in a conversation with your work. Through this will come humble and beautiful design solutions that will live on, affect culture, and change behavior. And through this will come a sense of subdued pleasure in your creative work. —Jon Kolko	end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experience;iteration;job stream;little big adventure;matrox mystique;norm (social);refinement (computing);reflection (computer programming);renaissance;traffic shaping;wonder boy in monster land	Jon Kolko	2009	Interactions	10.1145/1551986.1552003	human–computer interaction;gasket;expansion card;flange;electrical engineering;bracket;engineering;adapter (computing)	HCI	-62.50668737359695	-31.3082842784838	171480

People might want to reflect more often for these benefits, but find it difficult to do so in everyday life. Research in HCI has shown the potential of systems to support reflection in different contexts. In this paper we present a design space for supporting everyday life reflection. We produced a workbook with a selection of conceptual design proposals, which show how systems can take different roles in the process of reflection: triggering, supporting and capturing. We describe a design space with two dimensions by combining these roles with strategies found in literature. We contribute to the extensive body of work on reflection by outlining how design for everyday life reflection requires a focus on more holistic reflection, design with openness and integration in everyday life.	holism;human–computer interaction;openness	Ine Mols;Elise van den Hoven;Berry Eggen	2016		10.1145/2839462.2839466	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-60.475040812171144	-37.51914955304296	171692

Non-functional requirements dealing with accessibility and usability are especially important considerations when developing information systems for visually impaired stakeholders; however, this is not, yet, an area well understood in information systems development. This work aims to better understand the non-functional software requirements and realizable operationalizations needed to address the accessibility and usability challenges in computer gaming for the visually impaired. Building on previous work, this paper provides the analysis, results, and recommendations stemming from a systematic qualitative analysis of elicited qualitative text using adaptations of the grounded theory method. To do so, the authors developed a PC version of a 1980’s, 2D, Arcade style video game incorporating joystick controls and sound effects and gathered user experience data from six visually impaired users through a closed, pre-game and post-game interviews. The contribution of this work is part of a larger effort to develop systematic requirements engineering approaches, utilizing qualitative methods, to elicit, analyze, and operationalize non-functional software requirements within the information systems development process, to provide equal access to information systems for visually impaired users.	2d computer graphics;accessibility;arcade game;freedom of information laws by country;functional requirement;gaming computer;generative topographic map;information system;joystick;non-functional requirement;pc game;personal computer;requirements engineering;software development process;software engineer;software requirements;stemming;usability testing;user experience;video game design;virtual world	Joyram Chakraborty;Suranjan Chakraborty;Josh Dehlinger;Joseph Hritz	2016	Universal Access in the Information Society	10.1007/s10209-016-0510-z	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-62.41745900142455	-37.83923231208783	172686

The study is framed in a discussion of leisure time, critical theories of computation and rationalization theory. Qualitative interview data is used in an inductive and phenomenology inspired approach.  The results show two frames of understanding of gaming. First, games are perceived as media products and playing as a waste of time. Secondly, digital gaming is a hobby, a social activity highly valued within the framework of a rational time economy. We conclude that even though we are seeing a rationalization of leisure time in gaming, that rationalization process must be understood in the context of individualization within the new network society. This means that players are involved in a 'rational individualization' process where their management of leisure time and gaming activities are part of an ongoing identity project.	computation;theory	Lina Eklund;Fatima Jonsson	2012		10.1145/2132176.2132195	psychology;simulation;advertising;social psychology	HCI	-59.58071234427361	-33.30513693349439	173465

This work was undertaken with academics from University of Miami, Kim Grinfeder and Stephen Di Benedetto. The specific nature of the performance event, the filming of aspects of this experience and the post-production processes each raise significant questions relating to the development of methods of ‘interactive’ digital storytelling for ‘immersive’ audience experience. The role of theatre practice and performance design in developing these mediated experiences seems to be an important element that has largely been ignored in thinking about how digital immersive experiences might be created.

Initial prototypes are in the form of an interactive infrared camera based application for children to engage with an Aboriginal puppet. This scoping study is unique, as it tries to combine two extremes: the curation of historical intangible artifacts and their preservation through digital intervention. Heritage related intangible content is always restricted because of its non-physical nature and can never be fully embed in an environment like museums and related exhibitions. This paper explores alternative opportunities for knowledge transfer of ICH content that manifest with playfulness in order to elicit a deeper understanding of such intangible cultural artifacts. This study is complementary to multiple disciplines including heritage preservation, museum technologies and emerging interaction design.	augmented reality;case preservation;digital curation;interaction design;scope (computer science);sensor;sockpuppet (internet)	Muqeem Khan;Penny Baillie de Byl	2013	IJKSR	10.4018/jksr.2013040101	knowledge management;cultural heritage;multimedia;advertising;cultural heritage management;management;world wide web	HCI	-57.7117297622619	-36.86228740518085	174592

With the upcoming Olympic game in Tokyo, Japan 2020, digital signage is expected to be utilized for an effective information presentation device for them. This study focuses on the information presentation with four-frame comic for foreign tourists to improve cross-cultural understanding. A subject experiment was conducted to compare four information presentation methods including the four-frame comic from the viewpoint of attractiveness and easy memorization. Participants from various countries watched Japanese food tradition information with four information presentation methods (four-frame comic, photograph, illustration and video) and evaluated their impressions. As a result, it was found that four-frame comic was easy to memorize although its attractiveness was different depending on the participants. However, as the experiment was conducted in a controlled laboratory, it is necessary to conduct a field study using a digital signage in the city to investigate the effective information method.	digital signage;field research	Yuta Tsuji;Kimi Ueda;Hiroshi Shimoda;Hirotake Ishii;Masahiro Watanabe;Rika Mochizuki	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2017.8122767	comics;multimedia;machine learning;artificial intelligence;attractiveness;memorization;information and communications technology;computer science;digital signage;government	HCI	-57.325112556827186	-35.54654345493556	174816

Little work within Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) has considered how usability considerations propagate through such chains and yet in many situations the usability of systems is determined by design decisions made at one or more steps removed from the immediate developers of the system in question. In this paper, we relate our experiences of developing digital library components and collections to this notion of “design chains”. This case study illustrates the necessity of looking beyond the immediate users to try to anticipate the needs of stakeholders elsewhere in the design chain.	digital library;human–computer interaction;markov chain;usability	Ann Blandford;Jeremy Gow;George Buchanan;Claire Warwick;Jon Rimmer	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74796-3_23	digital library;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-59.40851548133316	-35.24366723944885	175321

The first Ambient Information System, known as the """"Dangling String"""" was described in the literature in 1996. Since this time a number of different systems have been reported. In this paper we re-examine the concepts, definitions and background to this field that have developed over the last 20 years by performing a detailed narrative review of the field. As a result we provide a detailed discussion on the key design features or dimensions that have been used to help categorise and evaluate such displays. We also examine 36 previously reported Ambient Information Systems and categorise them in terms of an existing taxonomy of design patterns for such systems. A benefit of this taxonomy approach is that it helps us identify an underutilised design area for these displays and leads us to propose a new design pattern, known as the """"Aesthetic Awareness Display"""" to assist in the design of these systems. This type of Ambient Display uses metaphors in order to encode a few data elements into an aesthetically pleasing display with the goal of raising general awareness about the data."""	categorization;encode;information systems;information system;interrupt;peripheral;software design pattern	Ben Shelton;Keith Nesbitt	2016		10.1145/2843043.2843371	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-59.59514830727915	-37.734999201388035	175796

However, if the mixed story loses the reality of the popular existing stories, it becomes unattractive to the audience.

da3532ccba9379be35155be9d866ee1c5a41a1e0	book introduction robot designed by children for promoting interest in reading		With the progress in several technologies, robots have been developed for educational support. However, these educational robots have a problem that children gradually lose their motivation for learning as they get used to interacting with the robots. To solve the problem of maintaining interest among children, the authors propose a new interaction method with the agent (user-generated agent:UGA) for an educational system with robots, in which children themselves design the contents of the agent. With the theme of introducing recommended books based on actual educational approaches, we construct a UGA system with an agent interposed between the child creator and the child listener, and conduct field research at an elementary school. The results reveal that the robot introduced books 17.9 times per day on average, the children took actions to pick up books after receiving introductions, and introduction methods with non-verbal expressions were effective. The UGA designer was not used much in the early stages of the research. The authors improved the UGA designer so that children designed four new items of content despite a short period. It is important to hide the name of the child who created the content in a method that allows children to design.	book;field research;graphics display resolution;interaction;robot;user-generated content	Takuya Sato;Yusuke Kudo;Hirotaka Osawa	2017		10.1145/3125739.3125740	simulation;computer science;educational robotics;field research;robot;interaction design;expression (mathematics)	HCI	-57.94343258351347	-31.214586354975594	176223

Indeed, interdisciplinary communities formed by scientists, university teachers and students, people coming from the industry and customers related to HCI are emerging in different parts of the world. In particular, this article overviews the HCI community in the Ibero-American context, which involves hundreds of millions of people working or studying in HCI, whose cultural background is primarily associated with the Spanish and Portuguese languages and cultures, regardless of ethnic and geographical differences. Our final goal is to improve the visibility of this particular HCI community, enhancing the self awareness of its members and their individual motivation and future exchanges.	human–computer interaction;self-awareness	Toni Granollers;César A.

Within this paper the authors investigate communication through movement within these two forms, firstly through discussion of professional experimental animation and dance performances and secondly through specific analysis of the digital dance performance Forever Falling Nowhere. The paper documents discussion with the choreographer, dancer, animator and the audience, seeking to examine the connection between the concept of the piece, the use of movement to imply meaning from the point of view of each of the creators and the audiences' perception. The paper will conclude by reflecting upon the importance of interpretation within experimental works asking if Norman McLaren's definition of animation can be used to draw deeper meaning from digital performances.	norman margolus;performance;point of view (computer hardware company);theme (computing)	Clare Brennan;Lynn Parker	2014		10.14236/ewic/eva2014.10	simulation;art;choreography;multimedia;communication	HCI	-59.088771352705436	-32.979293612428144	176694

We describe the design process and initial evaluation of a physical information kiosk to inform and motivate young adults to attend classical music concerts. As a starting point for our research, we analyzed the current situation at a local concert hall by involving people in a series of user studies, which included questionnaires, field observations, and interviews. Based on our findings, we designed an artifact that detects the presence of people and invites them to interact with it by playing extracts of upcoming classical music concerts. By means of an interface consisting of physical buttons, LEDs, and a limited resolution dot-matrix display, people obtain information on upcoming concerts and express their intention to attend. A small thermal printer is used to allow people to take the obtained information with them and potentially invite someone else to attend the concert with them. The results of an initial evaluation show that participants embraced the old school aesthetics of the artifact, felt that the physical buttons invited people to interact, that the provided information was relevant and interesting, and liked the possibility to be able to print out an invitation.	dot matrix;dot-matrix display;physical information;printer (computing);thermal printing;usability testing	Ralitsa Plamenova Petkova;Julian Kaduk;Andrés Lucero	2016		10.1145/2994310.2994365	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-56.17395095836087	-37.67435932927457	177660

Such biotic games are motivated and enabled by biotechnological advances and their increasing presence in everyday life constitute a form of human-biology interactions (HBI). Here we systematically discuss the design space for “digital-biology hybrid” games, summarize current best-practice design rules based on recent works, and point to technologies that will enable others to design and utilize similar games to advance this field. In particular, we show how augmentation with overlaid digital objects provides a rich design space, we emphasize the advantages when working with microorganisms and light based stimuli, and we suggest using biotic processing units (BPUs) as the fundamental hardware architecture. In analogy to the history of digital games, we make some predictions on the future evolution of biotic games as the underlying core technologies become readily accessible to practitioners and consumers. We envision that broadening the development of playful interactive biotechnology will benefit game culture, education, citizen science, and arts.	citizen science;host-based intrusion detection system;interaction	Lukas C.

This alternative is developed through a close analysis of a project at the intersection of computing and new media art, performance artist Stelare's prosthetic head.

Often large amounts of foundational work are necessary and dialogs among participants help clarify goals. The Social Discovery Framework suggests that (1) there are important processes in building capacity and then seeking solutions and (2) those that initiate requests are often as important as those who seek solutions. The implications of the Social Discovery Framework are that improved social tools to build capacity, initiate requests, and support dialog would accelerate the discovery process as much as the more visible tools for individuals seeking solutions.	social search;dialog	Ben Shneiderman	2011		10.1145/2069618.2069669	computer science;knowledge management;management science;user interface;world wide web	HCI	-61.46284910050421	-32.65020801859598	180408

We believe that cultural differences have an impact on the proliferation and wide usage of any assistive technology. Therefore, cultural aspects must be considered in the design of crossover applications for the B/VI community. Comprehensive cultural vision is necessary for an innovative application to be accepted widely. In addition, there is a need to revise and periodically review the application's acceptance, and update a product based on the cultural changes that may occur to some communities especially with the vast cultural exchange.

That information may be data, processes, relations or concepts. An expressive and effective visualization (Mackinlay, 1986) may use multiple techniques that can also be interactive. Information visualization has been successfully used in several domains, helping people to have a better insight of the data. The great challenge is always to map and to convey information properly according to the data visualization goals and to the potential end-users cognitive demands. In a high tech society people are expected to prefer the quick consumption of things with little time to seize them. The aim of this project is to understand to what extent cultural leisure is important in people’s everyday lives. We want to know what traits of society it can reveal and what causes and consequences can be reported and even associated to the numbers presented in the time series. Our goal is also to implement a prototype that depicts the Portuguese leisure-time trend along sixteen years, and to evaluate it.

This new method uses visual interpretation techniques to phenomenologically reveal extra detail of user behaviour from within user research. The Circle of Visual Interpretation methodology is aimed at design teams engaged in designing interactions to use during their ideation phase. Through visual interpretation a dialogue between designers and their target audience is phenomenologically crafted. From engaging in this hermeneutic-semiotic process fresh understanding regarding user motivations behind user actions visually emerges. In this paper each practical step in this methodology is summarised and illustrated with examples from a user research project.	interaction;semiotic engineering;semiotics;user research	Dave Wood	2014		10.1145/2662253.2662354	computer vision;user experience design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;interaction design;methodology;moment;visual communication	HCI	-59.966379567414855	-36.96413203046909	182676

Ignoring this concreteness may be a way of evading responsibility for conceptualizing how the Web can be used for serious and complex purposes, Our panel will consider alternatives to conventional ideas and structures and submit that the design of Web sites does not have to be limited to simple advertising vehicles or to equally simple institutional show and tell screens. We want to suggest that complexity and imagination ought not be limited by the constraints of HTML, bandwidth, or conventional wisdom, but freed by larger, more thoughtful notions of the possibilities of user interaction and hypertextualhy. Proposed for discussion will be theories of metaphor through which design becomes a way of thinking about various structures and the connections between them.	cyberspace;html;internet;theory;world wide web	Michael Joyce;Robert Kolker;Stuart Moulthrop;Ben Shneiderman;John Merritt Unsworth	1996		10.1145/234828.234854	working group;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;web server	HCI	-60.75144178766837	-33.63231955596852	182927

In recent years, unreasonable visual information design of DHCI has been proved to be one of the main reasons that cause a lot of serious accidents, which leads to users’ mistakes in cognitive understanding and decision-making periods. Complex system has a great amount of information and a complicated information structure, which is easy to result in the imbalance between visual information design and cognitive mechanism. This poster is planning to start from the brain mechanism research of visual information cognition, and carrying out visual information design research through a perspective that close to the origin attribute of human cognition, making the research on visual information analysis of the information structure and encoding method in DHCI.	cognition;human computer;human–computer interaction	Chengqi Xue;Xiaoli Wu;Yafeng Niu;Lei Zhou;Jiang Shao;Zhangfan Shen	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21380-4_26	computer vision;human–computer interaction;computer science	HCI	-57.496468403858955	-32.07068189905104	184801

The authors realise that discussions of images and image processing inveterately conceptualise representation as being flat, static, and finite. The authors recognise the need for a fresh acuteness to three-dimensionality as a meaningful – although problematic – element of visual sources. Two dramatically different examples are used to expose the shortcomings of an ingrained two-dimensional approach and to facilitate a demonstration of how modern (digital) techniques could sanction new historical/anthropological perspectives on subjects that have become all too familiar. Each example could not be more different in their temporal and geographical location, their cultural resonance, and their historiography. However, in both these visual spectacles meaning is polysemic. It is dependent upon the viewer's spatial relationship to the artifice as well as the spirito-intellectual viewer within the community. ...

Technological evolution has also provided advances in games, having relevance in the digital context with the emergence of video games. They are a relevant form of entertainment but do not always offer good experiences to the deaf player, limiting their play behavior. Often the sound landscape is an important feedback information provider, thus causing frustration for non-listeners. This work presents the development of an interface that aims to make the universe of audio games more accessible to deaf people through the visualization of the sound landscape. To achieve this objective, the project was based on understanding the deaf culture and understanding the pains of the user, so that tools could be created that assertively softened the main problems encountered. In this way, deaf players are expected to be able to experience richer experiences in digital games.

d850269a6e95214c6212c6402d06edb918f35db9	game reward systems: gaming experiences and social meanings		"""The authors give an overview of how various video game reward systems provide positive experiences to players, and propose classifications for rewards and reward characteristics for further analysis. We also discuss what reward systems encourage players to do, and describe how they provide fun even before players receive their rewards. Next, we describe how game reward systems can be used to motivate or change behaviors in the physical world. One of our main suggestions is that players can have fun with both rewards and reward mechanisms—enjoying rewards while reacting to the motivation that such rewards provide. Based on relevant psychological theories, we discuss how reward mechanisms foster intrinsic motivation while giving extrinsic rewards. We think that reward systems and mechanisms in modern digital games provide social meaning for players primarily through motivation, enhanced status within gaming societies, and the use of rewards as social tools. INTRODUCTION Examples of videogame rewards include virtual items received after completing World of Warcraft (Blizzard, 2004) quests, added points and visual effect after clearing block lines in Tetris, and finding treasure items in secret hiding places in the Super Mario Bros series (Nintendo). Reward systems can be viewed as player motivators or as compromises for easing disappointment. In modern video games, reward systems also provide social meaning within and outside of games (Reeves & Read, 2009; Salen & Zimmerman, 2004). To our knowledge, there is plenty of information and multiple theories in the psychology literature on optimal experiences, intrinsically motivating environments, sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, choice, and other concepts that reward system designers can take advantage of. Reward mechanisms provide sense of fun by fostering intrinsically rewarding experiences and are equally or more important than the extrinsic rewards that are distributed. The term """" intrinsic """" we use in this paper is about fun of playing itself while """" extrinsic """" is about the actual reward. Our goal in this paper is to review and analyze the main structural features of videogame reward systems."""	apache axis;experience;interaction;tetris;theory;visual effects;wired glove;world of warcraft	Hao Wang;Chuen-Tsai Sun	2011			psychology;simulation;knowledge management;social psychology	HCI	-59.259252785071666	-33.45603428462155	185902

I present a model, which illustrates how the designer can work with narratives, and the model is explained referring to experiences derived from different kinds of student reports and activities carried out in the years 1990- 92. Most computer systems are developed with the purpose of supporting people fulfilling some kind of activities and it is expected that this purpose should be achieved through some kind of interaction between human beings and the computer system. In this way system designers have always been aware of human beings when they develop computer systems. This statement is underlined by the fact that the term ‘user’—which to most system designers are a pseudonym for ‘human beings’, always have had a central positions in the development process. The many activities within the fields of HCI and CSCW underline the growing awareness among designers on the importance of making considerations about human beings in the development process.

The introduction of photography “apps,” like Hipstamatic or Instagram, adds layers of aesthetic capabilities not previously available within the camera. These capabilities have attracted artists seeking technologies for new media of artistic expression. Drawing on Becker’s theory of “art worlds,” this article describes the ways in which iPhone photographers, or iphoneographers, engage in the process of art world building. Through online ethnography and semistructured interviews, this study reveals the ways iphoneographers are creating, sharing, and critiquing their work. The practices of iphoneographers are not unlike those of artists engaged with new media throughout history, and indicate patterns of remediation. Through their activities, the iphoneography community is grappling with issues about the values, ...	art world;emergence	Megan Halpern;Lee Humphreys	2016	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444814538632	psychology;social science;environmental remediation;marketing;multimedia;sociology;advertising;world wide web	NLP	-58.11635093413379	-33.27754850904158	186613

The approach is motivated by an analysis of the functional and structural properties of relational diagrams in terms of their role as external representations. This analysis informs the design of a multiple perspective hierarchy-based model that captures modality independent features of a diagram when translating it into an audio accessible form.

First, 3D-IVWs--seen as a new and unique form of multimedia--are introduced and the social construction of the 3D-IVW technology is briefly discussed. Second, a selection of the basic concepts and identifiable entities in 3D-IVWs is defined and commented upon; these include representation, virtual worlds, objects, actors, bots or autonomous agents, avatars, and human actors. Third, some of the strange digital creatures that currently inhabit 3D-IVWs in the form of cyber-hybrids are outlined, including Alife/digital Biota, characters using genetic algorithms, game characters, mask characters, virtual humans, and avatar/agents. Fourth, modes of interactivity and virtual interactions between human actors, designers-in-avatars, user-in-avatars, bots, and objects in the new Virtual Worlds are briefly presented and typologized. Finally, the changing Internet and the virtual futures of 3D-IVWs are reflected upon.

This, along with higher wealth levels and rise of internet of things, has provided designers and planners the opportunity to reimagine living spaces. The smart homes that have arisen out of this reimagining come in many different shapes; but to gain widespread acceptance they have to increase the utility of building occupants in some meaningful way while not being intrusive. The most straightforward way of achieving this end goal is assumed to be through artificial intelligence. In this paper, we take a critical look at some algorithmic approaches that have been formulated to do so and the opportunities they will create in the short term. We also present some key challenges that must be overcome before these opportunities can be realized in practice.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;futures studies;home automation;humans;internet of things	Hussain Kazmi;Fahad Mehmood;Manar Amayri	2017	2017 14th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms and Networks & 2017 11th International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology & 2017 Third International Symposium of Creative Computing (ISPAN-FCST-ISCC)	10.1109/ISPAN-FCST-ISCC.2017.60	management science;futures contract;home automation;cognition;internet of things;business	EDA	-56.97230391510137	-37.1030661309702	187796

It is shown that task models are mainly used to support a specification-driven design process. Models about current task situations and more specific task descriptions play a marginal role. Task sketching is proposed to complement specification-driven modeling activities. The co-development of representations of current and envisioned practices is encouraged to support a shared design understanding and creativity. A detailed example illustrates basic ideas. Task models are represented in HOPS. Advantages of this specification formalism over conventional task modeling are shown with respect to task sketching. Models can be combined with illustrations, narratives or other design material at different levels of abstraction. Animations of enriched models help to explore the design space.	formal system;marginal model;principle of abstraction	Anke Dittmar;Peter Forbrig	2009		10.1145/1570433.1570455	model-based design;simulation;human–computer interaction;machine learning;task analysis;computer science;artificial intelligence;abstraction;creativity;function (engineering);formalism (philosophy);design process	HCI	-55.58240351897423	-34.21656360770965	187871

e9cd27d3fc04eb127c305474cda010e7831142eb	design and development of games and interactive installations for environmental awareness		Digital games and playful interactive installations are considered a promising means to raising awareness about the environment and persuading people to adopt an environmental friendly behavior. However, the selection and use of appropriate methods and paradigms for designing and evaluating such systems and successfully blending the ‘fun’ element with the messages to be communicated is still an active research issue. The aim of this paper is to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of using games and playful interactive technologies for changing people’s attitude towards the environment through a series of projects developed and publicly presented during a campaign for reducing the use of plastic bags. The development included the identification of the projects’ goals, an analysis of people, activities, target behavior and context of use, and finally the design and prototyping of the interactive installations. In total, eight projects have been developed, six interactive installations and two digital games that have been publicly presented, used and evaluated during the campaign. An additional user evaluation of the two games has been performed in the laboratory, to gain more insight on their usability and impact. The paper presents an overview of the design process and methodology, the main design elements of each project, and a number of observations and preliminary evaluation results.	alpha compositing;enterprise application integration;interactivity;pc game;software prototyping;usability	Anna Gardeli;Spyros Vosinakis;Konstantinos Englezos;Dimitra Mavroudi;Manolis Stratis;Modestos Stavrakis	2017	EAI Endorsed Trans.

Prominent examples often aim to motivate a specific target behavior or follow learning goals.  Nonetheless, the current practice of gamification often seems onesided regarding its motivational design as reward structures dominate most examples. One reason might be the lack of an established, holistic perspective on the user that informs the designer on personal, motivational and game-related attributes and needs within the context.  This paper introduces the concept of a play-persona, that builds on multifaceted theories of personality psychology, motivational psychology, game-design and user-centered design and a series of expert interviews across this disciplines. Furthermore, an explorative study regarding correlations between personality and play preferences was conducted. The resulting design-tool is suggested to encourage strong and elaborated discussions on user's needs among the design team, thus supporting the design process.	gamification;holism;institute for operations research and the management sciences;mechatronics;theory;user-centered design	Stephanie Scheja;Ralf Schmidt;Maic Masuch	2016		10.1145/2994310.2994356	psychology;user experience design;knowledge management;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-62.054829147305725	-36.332731120672804	188775

Does a vibrator motor provide enough feedback to make a virtual keyboard seem """" real """" ? Asking questions like these is important in designing tangible products. Such questions challenge us to reflect upon how artifacts facilitate interaction and help us connect with people on deeper levels. The hand ax reminds us that design has always been about interaction, and interaction has always been tangible. What's new is that physical interaction is becoming computation-ally mediated—or conversely, that computational media are becoming physically embodied. Designers of physical things and places must consider how to embed software; designers who work in software alone must leverage the constraints and affordances of the physical world. New paradigms are arising through the investigation of new embodiments of technology that achieve seamless integration of form and interaction.

Today interaction design includes services, systems, and strategic planning and reflects core principles of human-system/human-object interaction. Within the diverse landscape of interaction exists a specialized area where physical form and computing combine to yield new paradigms of interaction. This area, """" tangible """" interaction design, broadens scope, relevance, and application, linking interaction designers more directly with product development. It provides a new arena for industrial designers, transdisciplinary thinkers, and experimenters to develop arti-facts that behave, react, and/or interact with people. More than computation or embedded intelligence alone, tangible interaction design focuses on human behavior and experience that guides the design of form and establishes the roles an artifact will play. Tangible interaction designers use their work to question and reflect on the integration of technology and its effects on human experience. the First interaction Designers?

The project aims to enable a relationship between the user of the tool and an audience in a different place or time with an absolute minimum of editorial mediation by a third party. The tool itself incorporates a digital camera and a binaural audio recording device that captures the minute of sound before and after a picture is taken. To inform the design process, we tested prototypes in a progression of three studies within different cultural contexts in Ireland, France, and Mali. We present the results of these experiences, in which we observed among our participants an emerging set of ways of exploiting the tool for different purposes: social glances, depictions of activities, active documentation, and intentional discourses. We also discuss more generally the advantages and pitfalls of multicultural analyses of prototype technologies like the one we undertook.	binaural beats;color gradient;digital camera;documentation;mali (gpu);minimally invasive education;prototype;tracing (software)	Joëlle Bitton;Stefan Agamanolis;Matthew Karau	2004		10.1145/985692.985755	simulation;design process;human–computer interaction;photography;multimedia;memory;world wide web	HCI	-56.7882484348596	-36.97974277723911	189221

However, visitors often do not engage with them. In this paper we explore the application of visual makers that can be designed to be meaningful and that can be created by visitors themselves. We study both the use of these markers as labels for portraits that link to audio recordings and as a mechanism for visitors to contribute their own reflections to the exhibition by drawing a marker and linking an audio comment. Our findings show visitors appreciated the use of the aesthetic markers and engaged with them at three levels -- physical placement, aesthetic content and digital content. We suggest that these different levels need to be considered in the design of future visiting systems, which make use of such markers, to ensure they are mutually supporting in shaping the experience.

f15af5645e34a9959e15c30eeaa72afa48ecf61d	exteraction: a new state of user experience processing for understanding people		With the recent development of new interactive technologies we are witnessing a divide between human activities and the virtual world. After reaching its most glamorous period, the existing representation of interaction has been questioned from various perspectives. This article describes a new definition of Exteraction that explores the extent to which a combination of grounded theory and decentralization approaches can be useful in understanding the process of information exchanging activities. By analyzing the limitation through cross-sectional phenomenon including online services, art installation and film, this article helps formulate the characteristics of the following elements beyond interaction: the changeability and versatility of user experience; the greater accuracy of filtered information; holistic tolerance of reflecting both individual and entire value; re-evaluating people's position within the process and navigating the unknown data based on revealing the existing. All of these have provided a summary of the opportunities and gaps of both approaches that will later be identified as a highly flexible method -- Exteraction, which can adapt to many contexts and conditions. The mock-up projects which are illustrating the idea of Exteraction have been created based on the results of the initial case studies. It is expected that by doing so, the methodological understanding of the approach can be deepened to conduct research and design projects in the near future. In other words, this would enable people to validate the findings and would also broaden the understanding of how to best involve Exteraction in the process of developing a more sustainable framework.	care-of address;conceptualization (information science);cross-sectional data;durability (database systems);e-services;emergence;holism;human–computer interaction;interactive design;mock object;personalization;prototype;user experience;virtual world;while	Jie Hao;Yuehan Pan;Qiheng Zhu;Zhiyong Fu	2018		10.1145/3202667.3202668	management science;user experience design;grounded theory;decentralization;business;phenomenon	HCI	-60.54221867184668	-37.91490741768652	192711

Unlike all other interactive narrative prototypes the framework advanced focuses on the optimal dramatic flow of the emerging user narrative so that although fragmented, it can be engaging and make sense. Using a sample narrative from Ovid's Metamorphoses [18] we demonstrate a method to evaluate dramatic levels as plot points so that movement across narratives retains a strong dramatic flow. Although users may never choose to explore any given linear narrative in its entirety, the result is an engaging and rich narrative experience.	emergence	Alyx Macfadyen;Andrew Stranieri;John Yearwood	2007		10.1145/1367956.1367969	humanities;psychology;narrative criticism;narrative network;communication;social psychology	HCI	-59.07578026879261	-37.50127535254523	194051

Such an approach allows it to be understood as opening the possibility of an awareness of the contingency of the way any given community is constructed. The focus is shifted away from understanding data visualisation art as providing a transparent representation of reality. This is exemplified in the work They Rule which, approached in these terms, invites an engagement with the law’s role in enabling networks of powerful people to be constructed. They Rule opens the possibility of perceiving the law’s violence in the way that it asserts the authority of enabling and enforcing the existence of such connections. An awareness of the constructed nature of legal networks opens the law to the possibility of change by those it excludes.	awareness;data visualization;internet art	Jeremy Pilcher	2010		10.1007/978-1-4471-5406-8_14	social science;artificial intelligence;sociology;social psychology	HCI	-60.09932796541157	-33.014066195450305	196024

Understanding not only what technical functionality a digital tabletop can provide, but also how appropriate that functionality is for different usage contexts is crucial in designing tables intended for use outside of the research lab. In this paper, we propose five contextual factors to consider in the tabletop design process - social and cultural, activity, temporal, ecological, and motivational - and discuss how these factors influence the design of three main aspects of tabletop systems: software interface, physical form, and connectedness. This work provides a means for tabletop designers to understand the factors that impact the applicability of existing and future design approaches for a given context of use.	contextual design	James R.

The aim of the article is to provide novice and expert designers in human computer interaction an introduction to sonic interaction design, to auditory displays, and to the methods used to design the sounds and interactions. A range of the current best practices are analysed. These are discussed with regard to the key methods and concepts, by providing examples from existing work in the field. A complementary framework is presented to highlight how these methods can be used together by an auditory display designer at the early conceptual design stage. These methods are reflected upon and provides a closing discussion on the future directions of research that can be explored using these approaches.	sonic interaction design	Eoin Brazil	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-12439-6_3	simulation;design methods;human–computer interaction;sonic interaction design;computer science;interaction design;auditory display;conceptual design;best practice	HCI	-61.24817469298641	-37.309640009878656	196118

In this paper we identify the discrepancy between media capturing and media reliving from a design perspective. We propose a holistic perspective, that invites designers of media experiences to considering all three interdependent aspects of the media process: media capturing interaction, specific media, and media reliving interaction. By adopting this view, we aim to ensure that the media that is captured will be both necessary and appropriate for the intended reliving experience. We illustrate our perspective with three design concepts. Finally, in the discussion we present several topics related to media capturing and reliving.	discrepancy function;experience;holism;interdependence	Mendel Broekhuijsen;Ine Mols;Elise van den Hoven	2016		10.1145/3010915.3010959	user experience design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;photography;digital media;interaction design;multimedia	HCI	-60.77385945690795	-36.07257418064433	196322

We identify four strategies for relating sources of inspiration to emerging ideas: selection; adaptation; translation; and combination. As our starting point, we argue that sources of inspiration are a form of knowledge crucial to creativity. Our research is based on empirical findings arising from the use of Inspiration Card Workshops, which are collaborative design events in which domain and technology insight are combined to create design concepts. In addition to the systematically introduced sources of inspiration that form part of the workshop format, a number of spontaneous sources of inspiration emerged during these workshops.	interaction design;spontaneous order	Kim Halskov	2010	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626268.2010.502236	innovation;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;interaction design;multimedia;creativity	HCI	-62.17479950357225	-35.26297567897595	196541

Problems with the former lie in the conceptual and compositional constraints imposed upon users by software tools that clearly define the scope of available musical expressions. It is for this reason that many musicians, determined to fight the fossilization of music into stylistic boxes, often choose to work with programming environments that allow for more extensive experimentation. However, problems here include the practically infinite expressive scope of the environment, sometimes resulting in a creative paralysis or in the frequent symptom of a musician-turned-engineer. Consequently, a common strategy can be detected, defined here as that of designing constraints, where the instrument designer, the composer, or the performer (a distinction often irrelevant in these systems; see Drummond 2009) devises a relatively high-level system of constraints, encapsulating a defined space for potential expression, whether of compositional or gestural nature. This article engages with this situation by exploring the Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts of affordances, constraints, and mapping. We examine how computational systems of musical expression always involve the establishment of a particular stratum that provides certain affordances to the musician, while concurrently posing important constraints. The article studies how constraints can serve as sources for creative explorations. For this purpose, three systems are analyzed: the mLog, Phalanger, and the ixi lang.

The broad community of independent game developers remains mostly challenged by small budgets and lack of know-how, while trying to integrate sound in their games.  The empowerment of a broad community of developers, by making practical guidance available, could improve the quality of their productions and unleash a massive creative potential, with results in the form of innovative sound design ideas and further development of the body of knowledge.  Here we present the argument that there are favorable conditions for a collective authoring of a pattern language in sound design, to be achieved with the inventory, translation or resynthesis of current practice and academic know-how, in a format that is addressable by experts and non-experts alike.  Learning from the effects such a methodology had in other domains where similar concerns were observed, we present a seminal pattern collection with the purpose of illustrating its feasibility and spark the interest of the broad community of sound design.

However, a pitfall in these digital designs is to focus too much on the game rules and goals. In doing so, we miss the opportunity to design around the more open and self-expressive play that we might relate to our childhoods. In response to this problem, we will explore new digital designs using a lens of play. In treating play as something aspirational, we believe our designs will be able to change our relationships with each other and give new meaning to the spaces around us.	interaction design	Gavin Wood	2014		10.1145/2658537.2659012	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-59.91124822617598	-36.30371527909	197815

One tendency seems to be in the direction of integrated work stations which aim at supporting the broad diversification of tasks which professional users have to cope with. Therefore earlier efforts originating within the fields of “ergonomics” and “human factors” are undergoing a radical development in the direction of a serious concern with understanding and dealing with the basic interactions between people and their actual work situation. Major areas include user modelling, task performance, decision making and user-system communications. This concern has spawned an activity called cognitive engineering having the overall goal of providing good human-work interfaces and incorporating as a principle ingredient a cognitive task analysis (Pejtersen and Rasmussen 1986).	cognitive engineering;diversification (finance);human factors and ergonomics;information retrieval;interaction;librarian;mod database;modem;online and offline;p5 (microarchitecture);security technical implementation guide;steen rasmussen;systems design;task analysis;on-line system	Annelise Mark Pejtersen	2017	SIGIR Forum	10.1145/3130348.3130360	cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;task analysis;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;human–computer information retrieval	HCI	-56.13144749959498	-33.877359815103986	198029

In this position paper we discuss new challenges arising from these initiatives with regard to casual users. To meet their specific needs, we introduce a novel method for synoptic collection visualization which makes use of parallel space-time cubes to provide multiple spatiotemporal overviews, support free exploration, and to specifically engage casual audiences.	cubes;database;olap cube	Florian Windhager;Eva Mayr;Günther Schreder;Michael Smuc;Paolo Federico;Silvia Miksch	2016			visualization;humanities;multimedia;cultural heritage;computer science;cognitive reframing	Visualization	-57.736895905567195	-32.683756370082385	198357

For example, they are very good at performing calculations, storing information and producing visualisations of objects that do not yet exist as a made artifact. Increasingly, however, a different role is being found for the computer. It is the role of a catalyst, or a stimulant, to our own creative thinking. In such cases the computer is not primarily performing a task for us and generating an answer within itself, rather it is helping us to generate answers within ourselves. The computer helps us think creatively. This role for the computer can be illustrated in the context of computer support to creative design. In order to design computer systems that support the creative process, it is important to understand that process well enough to predict what might help, rather than hinder. Given such research, we may begin to define the characteristics of what the computer must do in order to augment creative thinking. The paper explores a particular application of intelligent user interfaces:- the augmentation of creative thought in artists.	computer;technical support	Ernest A.

The point of view taken is situated between the development and application of technological tools, the design and running of exploratory experiments, and the musical performance moment, where perception of the body and its movements constitutes an integral part of the experience. Through a use-case that is shared with other artists and researchers, a wide range of necessary developments, both conceptually and in software is shown. The tools and the methods generated are juxtaposed with the realisation that movement analysis is merely one possible usage of acquired data. Artistic translations provide alternate ways of generating meaning from movement data, in particular when translating musical actions to pieces that span multiple modalities. With the proposed multi-perspective methodology, ways and means are sketched out that address the inherent multiplicity of domains involved in music performance and perception.	experiment;floor and ceiling functions;point of view (computer hardware company);realization (linguistics);situated	Jan C.

3f4f96a4f36cb1bb0a11f5d200d3ecfd70fe0483	model validation for vision systems via graphics simulation		Rapid advances in computation, combined with latest advances in computer graphics simulations have facilitated the development of vision systems and training them in virtual environments. One major stumbling block is in certification of the designs and tuned parameters of these systems to work in real world. In this paper, we begin to explore the fundamental question: Which type of information transfer is more analogous to real world? Inspired from the performance characterization methodology outlined in the 90’s, we note that insights derived from simulations can be qualitative or quantitative depending on the degree of the fidelity of models used in simulations and the nature of the questions posed by the experimenter. We adapt the methodology in the context of current graphics simulation tools for modeling data generation processes and, for systematic performance characterization and trade-off analysis for vision system design leading to qualitative and quantitative insights. In concrete, we examine invariance assumptions used in vision algorithms for video surveillance settings as a case study and assess the degree to which those invariance assumptions deviate as a function of contextual variables on both graphics simulations and in real data. As computer graphics rendering quality improves, we believe teasing apart the degree to which model assumptions are valid via systematic graphics simulation can be a significant aid to assisting more principled ways of approaching vision system design and performance modeling.	algorithm;closed-circuit television;computation;computer graphics;experiment;profiling (computer programming);rendering (computer graphics);simulation;stumbleupon;systems design;virtual reality;virtual world	V.

Thanks to their resolution, this collaboration can take place up-close to the display, while still supporting group awareness of who is working on what part of the display by taking a step back. This group awareness is amplified by the possibility of interacting directly using multitouch.
