We give an overview of the context in which this topic was dealt with, the major methodological results that were achieved, and the text condensation system TOPIC that was built on these principles. We then survey current trends in the field of automatic text summarization which reveal the renaissance of the 'abstracting-as-extracting' approach. We relate this observation to the fundamental paradigmatic shift from natural language understanding to human language technology and discuss its implications for information science.	automatic summarization;information science;language technology;natural language understanding;renaissance	Udo Hahn	2004			language technology;informing science;automatic summarization;linguistics;natural language processing;natural language understanding;artificial intelligence;computer science	NLP	-55.59634914062328	-10.785092103650072	145655

We are grateful for having been given this opportunity to publish the papers presented at the World Library and Information Congress: 75th IFLA General Conference and Assembly, Milan, August 2009. The papers were presented in a joint open session organized by the Library and Research Services for Parliaments Section and the Library History Section. This issue of Library Trends also includes two papers on parliamentary libraries in Uganda and Pakistan that were not presented at the Congress. The overall theme of the Congress was “Libraries Create Futures: Building on Cultural Heritage.” Within this context, the two organizing sections called for papers on the theme of “Changing Visions: Parliamentary Libraries Past, Present and Future.”1	futures studies;library (computing);library history;organizing (structure)	Gro Sandgrind	2010	Library Trends	10.1353/lib.2010.0000	social science;computer science	HPC	-61.24994614923246	-15.237753468762003	149187

Fifteen correspondents are represented, chief among them music theorists Giovanni Spataro of Bologna, Pietro Aaron of Florence, and del Lago. Del Lago intended to publish twenty-two of these letters as Epistole composte in lingua volgare; he changed them to cast his reputation in a more favorable light and in so doing borrowed freely from other music theorists. He would have been shocked to see the letters in their present state, with all the unfavorable references to him that he meant to delete. 1 Spataro had hoped that his own letters """"might interest a refined soul in the future"""" (64), but little did he realize that it would be 450 years until publication! These letters have been the subject of previous studies, the most complete being Knud Jeppesen's article, """"Eine musiktheoretische Korrespondenz des friiheren Cinquecento' '2 (A Correspondence is dedicated to the memory of Jeppesen).

We are grateful to the conference organisers, Nigel Armstrong, Joan Beal, Fiona Douglas, Barry Heselwood, Susan Lacey, Ann Thompson, and Clive Upton for their cooperation in our organisation of the event. We likewise owe thanks to the referees of the present volume, who we are pleased to acknowledge explicitly: Agnes de Bie, Roberto Bolognesi, David Britain, Cynthia Clopper, Ken Decker, Anders Eriksson, Hans Goebl, Stefan Grondelaers, Carlos Gussenhoven, Nynke de Haas, Frans Hinskens, Angela Kluge, Gitte Kristiansen, Alexandra Lenz, Maarten Mous, Hermann Niebaum, Lisa Lena Opas-Hänninen, Petya Osenova, John Paolillo, Louis Pols, Helge Sandøy, Bob Shackleton, Felix Schaeffler, Marco Spruit, Rint Sybesma, Nathan Vaillette, Gunther de Vogelaer, and Esteve Valls. The conference track consisted of 24 papers and posters, including a keynote address by Vincent van Heuven on phonetic techniques for studying variation and comprehensibility. Fourteen contributions were selected for publication in this special issue of the International Journal for Humanities and Arts Computing, including van Heuven’s. In addition the conference track featured a panel session reflecting on the introduction of computational techniques to the study of language variation and more generally, on computing and the humanities. We have prepared a report on the panel session for publication here as well.	armstrong's axioms;computation;cynthia dwork;joan feigenbaum;kludge;lenna;precedence effect;roberto busa;susan landau	John Nerbonne;Charlotte Gooskens;Sebastian Kürschner;Renée van Bezooijen	2008	IJHAC	10.3366/E1753854809000287	natural language processing;computer science;linguistics	Visualization	-55.738875026037434	-16.203395303686293	157162

f94c0413b91c53864489ce4c724dfd823df009c8	british machine vision conference 2000	machine vision	This edition of the IVC journal is devoted to some of the top-rated papers from BMVC2000, the 11th British Machine Vision Conference, hosted by the University of Bristol in September 2000. The conference coincided with a fuel shortage crisis, but there were no delegate cancellations and there were even some new registrations on the ®rst day. Altogether there were around 150 delegates from all over the UK as well as 18 other countries most of whom had contributed papers. In addition to the contributed papers at BMVC2000, there was a pre-conference tutorial presented by Prof. There were 149 original papers submitted to the conference for double-blind refereeing. Three referees reviewed each paper and a total of 38 oral papers and 42 poster papers were accepted. Updated versions of some of the highest ranking papers, as voted by the Programme Committee, were then selected and sent to totally new referees for further review for possible inclusion in this special issue. The papers that appear in this issue are a testament to the high quality of work regularly presented at BMVC conferences. Although a British conference, many papers are international , such as Ahmed and Farag from the USA, Rother from Sweden, or Kru Èger and Sommer from Germany in this issue. The standard is, as usual, internationally outstanding. Face and gesture recognition is currently a very popular area of research in computer vision and this is well represented in this special issue through papers by Bowden and Sarhadi, Cootes et al., Costen et al., and Kru Èger and Sommer concentrating mainly on building and manipulating models. For example, Cootes et al. extend their previous work and report on building models that represent the appearance of a face as seen from two or more different viewpoints simultaneously. There were also a signi®cant number of motion segmentation and tracking papers at the conference. Making a well-earned appearance here are the papers by Karaulova et al. presenting a hierarchical model of dynamics for tracking people with a single camera, also the winner of the best demonstration prize at the conference, the paper by Tweed and Calway on depth ordering of motion layers based on colour region segmentations with motion estimates obtained via block correlation , and the paper by Bromiley et al. who describe statistical techniques to isolate localised differences from global differences in motion sequences. Also Arbel and Ferrie present their interesting work …	british machine vision conference;computer vision;delegate (cli);display resolution;gesture recognition;hierarchical database model;testament	Majid Mirmehdi	2002	Image Vision Comput.	10.1016/S0262-8856(02)00048-3	computer vision;machine vision;computer science	Vision	-58.18867219185734	-15.854257369695862	167680
fec28d54c3c31fe088b3ec597029f934dc9e1837	preface: the 11th international conference on scientometrics and informetrics		The 11th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics held in Madrid (Spain) in June 2007 was organised by the Centre for Scientific Information and Documentation (CINDOC) of the Spanish Research Council (CSIC) in cooperation with several Information Science Departments of Spanish universities and under the auspices of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI).* The meeting was hosted by the Spanish Research Council in the Serrano Central Campus. The previous ten events in this series of biannual international conferences on Scientometrics and Informetrics had been held in Belgium (1987), Canada (1989), India (1991), Germany (1993), USA (1995), Israel (1997), Mexico (1999), Australia (2001), China (2003) and Sweden (2005). In total, about 250 registered participants have attended the meeting with 92 oral and 77 poster presentations covering all relevant topics and sub-disciplines of present-day research in our field. We have selected 29 original research papers which will be published in two subsequent specials issues of the journal Scientometrics. The present papers are extended versions of contributions orally presented at the conference, reflecting comments given by colleagues and referees during and after the conference. Finally, we would like to mention that the biannual ISSI conference series will be continued this year; the 12 Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in July 2009.	documentation;information science;informetrics;scientometrics;winsock	Wolfgang Glänzel;Henk F.

Carol has been a leader in blending strong academic rigor with practice-oriented relevance throughout her career. She has served MISQE as an author, editorial board member, and currently, as a senior editor (SE). As a former Academic VP of SIM, she has worked closely with SIM, our sponsor. Carol pioneered the idea of using the SIM Academic workshop to create a pipeline for an annual special issue of MISQE. She was the guest editor, with Christina Soh, of the first special issue in 2007. Please join me in congratulating Carol on her new role.	alice and bob;alpha compositing;comment (computer programming);mis quarterly executive;management information systems quarterly;relevance;subscriber identity module	Carol V.

Fig. 1 shows a capacitor bank of a high-voltage substation, which contains sets of high-power capacitors in series and in parallel. Banks of Leyden jars, at first called “Leyden jar batteries” and “electrostatic batteries,” were the first capacitor banks. The Leyden jar was invented in 1745, independently by Ewald Georg Jürgen von Kleist of Kammin, Prussia (now Kamień Pomorski in Poland) and by Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leiden ( Leyden in archaic Dutch), Holland, although nationalist attitudes have led to preferences for the former or latter inventor in some narratives [1], [2]. Kleist first reported his discovery in letters dated November 4 and November 28, 1745 [3]. The letter of November 28, 1745 has survived; an image is accessible online [4]. Musschenbroek first reported his discovery in a letter (in Latin) dated January 20, 1746 [5]. The letter included the illustration of Fig. 2.

ed1e0c717d48728e99e967a4ff8dc4e78466db89	editorial: a new direction for the ieee transactions on education: part ii. increasing the relevance of your manuscript		Members of the global community of engineers and educators share their work through the IEEE Transactions on Education. To enhance this interaction, the Editorial Board (Associate Editors and Editor-in-Chief) intends that the journal will emerge as the definitive source of scholarship for education in electrical engineering, computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, and other fields within the scope of interest of the IEEE. For this to be accomplished, the quality and value of the published work must increase. One step toward this goal has been to develop and propagate new review criteria, adopted in July 2013, that articulate expectations for published papers. This is the second in a series of editorials designed to help authors address these review criteria effectively, and thus improve the likelihood that their manuscripts will be accepted.	relevance	Jeffrey E.

A. Rickard's first technical writing textbook published in 1908. The paper extends this exploration to include influences on Rickard's understanding of technical writing's social function, such as classical encyclopedic traditions, books of Hermetic secrets, and the first textbook developed by Comenius in the early 17th century. Throughout this history, the works of Francis Bacon provide a backdrop against which to understand how technical writing came to stabilize a scientific knowledge system and how this knowledge system was represented in textbooks.	backdrop cms;book;francis;harry potter and the chamber of secrets;knowledge-based systems	Bernadette Longo	2000		10.1145/504800.504845		ML	-59.812283461714735	-12.86839557529556	187873

6babc9625891d1f98ae9343a51023c0e38bcb786	introduction to the re’10 special issue requirements engineering in a multi-faceted world	requirement engineering	The 18th International Requirements Engineering Conference, held in Sydney, Australia, from September 27, 2010 to October 1, 2010, addressed the challenges of ‘‘Requirements Engineering in a multi-faceted World.’’ This theme highlighted the rich and diverse contexts of software and systems engineering projects, where requirements engineering methodologies, tools, and processes, are influenced by factors such as the size, domain, location, criticality, people, and organizational culture of a project. The origins of the requirements engineering conference series stems back to the IEEE Symposium on Requirements Engineering held in San Diego, California, in 1993. For 8 years, the symposium alternated with the Conference on Requirements Engineering, until the two series were merged to form a single conference in 2002. The current merged conference provides an annual forum for researchers and practitioners to engage in a lively discussion and debate of current issues and challenges related to both the theory and practice of requirements engineering. The 18th International Conference on Requirements Engineering hosted three excellent keynote speakers. Dr. Al Davis, Professor at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, challenged participants to keep their eyes focused on the end goal of their research and to deliver solutions that ultimately impact and improve the state of practice. Dr. Mary O’Kane, Chief Scientist and Scientific Engineer in the State of New South Wales, Australia, and also Executive Chairman of a Sydney-based company that advises governments, universities, and the private sector on innovation, research, education, and development, contextualized requirements engineering issues from the perspective of Australia’s recent growth in both government and industrial sectors. Finally, Dr. Graeme Simsion, who served as CEO of a business and information systems consultancy company and now works as an independent consultant, shared his perspectives on consulting and ethics in the requirements engineering domain. The 18th International Requirements Engineering Conference included both an industry and a research track which fostered lively and insightful conversations between academics and practitioners. The research track received 153 viable submissions. A multi-tiered review process was followed in which each paper was evaluated by three program committee members, and papers with at least one positive review were discussed further by program committee and board members. Ultimately 24 full-length papers were accepted, and three short papers, producing an acceptance rate of just under 16%. Program Committee members were then asked to recommend papers for consideration for this special edition of the Requirements Engineering Journal. Eight papers were recommended and ultimately five of them were selected for submission. All of these papers have undergone a standard journal review process with subsequent revisions, and we are pleased to present them in this special issue of REJ. The first paper accepted to this special issue of REJ, entitled ‘‘Analysing anaphoric ambiguity in natural language requirements’’ by Yang, de Roeck, Gervasi, Willis, and Nuseibeh, investigates the problem of nocuous ambiguities. These occur when requirements are written in natural language, and humans disagree on their interpretation. This paper, which won the best paper award at the conference, describes an automated approach for identifying such ambiguities in a requirements specification. Highlighting potential problem areas allows humans to discuss and disambiguate the impacted requirements. J.

However not only the effectiveness of this kind of games is not yet demonstrated but the distribution and adoption of these games from the normal public is still very low. In this paper we present a design strategy we adopted in on the occasion of the development of a game for hemiplegic rehabilitation named “Hammer and Planks”. This game strategy allowed us to create a “game for all”, as will be demonstrated by the example of the usage of the game on the occasion of a game event in the south of France.	kinect;point of view (computer hardware company);software testing;video game design	Ines Di Loreto;Benoit Lange;Antoine Seilles;Sebastien Andary;William Dyce	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40790-1_7	non-cooperative game;video game design;combinatorial game theory;game design;games;simulation;4x;simultaneous game;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;computer science;win-win game;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;game art design;metagaming;repeated game;game developer;multimedia;screening game;advertising;simulations and games in economics education;sequential game	HCI	-56.42174362959255	-13.081999887170573	188464

I’m Marianne Winslett, and today I am at the 2010 SIGMOD and PODS conference in Indianapolis. I have here with me Tova Milo, who is a professor of computer science at Tel Aviv University. Tova and her coauthors are the recipient of the Alberto Mendelzon PODS 10 Year Paper Award for 2010. Her PhD is from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. So, Tova, welcome! What do you view as the impact of database theory in recent years? I think the cleaning of information, the cleaning of concepts, cleaning of models, cleaning of ideas, and things like that. So it is the development of simple models, simple algorithms, checking what is possible and what is not possible, and so on, trying to have it clean. Ok, clean and tidy. So, maybe the really practical people in our community would say, “Why do we need it to be clean as long as it works?”	algorithm;computer science;database theory;html tidy;marianne winslett;plasma cleaning;project milo;symposium on principles of database systems	Marianne Winslett	2010	SIGMOD Record	10.1145/1942776.1942780	data mining;computer science;data science	DB	-60.038495598548536	-16.67685154665984	197860
