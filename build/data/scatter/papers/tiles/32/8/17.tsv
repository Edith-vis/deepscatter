96ab2e0fef141d4377208fa6d9a3ee25e6c7deb9	the use of social tagging in social business process management	social knowledge management;social bpm;tags	Socially driven business process management is the latest paradigm in BPM research. Social elements present in social BPM from one hand and the rigid sequential workflows in traditional BPM systems from another hand had made it difficult to have a full understanding of what social BPM really means, until recently where goal-oriented approach was introduced to overcome this contradiction. One of the main characteristics of social business process management is its inherent collaborative nature during all of its phases starting from the design stage all the way to the execution and improvement phase. This paper aims to provide a model for social BPM in which the post execution tagging of business processes logs is utilised by a process management system to assist future process participants with recommendations for task execution and role assignment. It is believed that this approach will lead to a truly socially driven business process management system where there is transparent and continuous participation of the users.	business process;folksonomy	Mohammad Ehson Rangiha;Bill Karakostas	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-20370-6_7	knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;database;management science;process management;world wide web;business process modeling	DB	-60.897128938953074	16.12961069029576	186543

A key aspect of CBM is the layered intra-enterprise approach that identifies Execution, Control and Direction. However, the performance relationships between these layers can be a challenging to compute algorithmically, because of the typical ‘impedance’ mismatch between the underlying models and metrics used at these layers. In this paper, we introduce a meta-model related to microeconomics and Activity Based Costing - which we call the Interaction model. We show how this algorithmically relates operational execution data; to CBM heat maps for large scaled service-oriented systems. We use production data from the city of Columbus' 311 system (a one-stop request handling system for city services) to illustrate the value of this algorithm in generating the heat map to help service investments and other dashboard type applications.	ace;algorithm;blog;columbus;decision support system;heat map;map analysis;metamodeling;missing data;programming paradigm;sentiment analysis;service-oriented device architecture;social network;theory;traceability;transformational grammar	Chaitanya Shivade;Farha Mukri;Rajiv Ramnath;Jayashree Ramanathan	2011	Proceedings of 2011 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Service Oriented System (SOSE)	10.1109/SOSE.2011.6139113	computer simulation;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;operating system;software engineering;database;management;computer security;activity-based costing	SE	-56.9615948780446	17.429270369425186	186650

Decision integration is a method to improve the quality of decision making. This research effort builds on previous results in attempting to establish the theoretical foundation of operational decision integration for such systems. Properly designed integration always improves the quality of the decisions; this is demonstrated through the use of a distributed hypothesis testing model. The problem of organizing decision making agents into architectures of integration is addressed by analyzing several elementary decision architectures for organizations, and comparing their performance. Explicit algorithmic procedures are developed to determine the optimal decision integration methods for a variety of organizations. Five motivating examples are presented to explicitly demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. These procedures constitute the. fundamental building blocks for analyzing the architectures of larger more realistic systems.		Jason D. Papastavrou;Shimon Y.

It explores both the functionality and the technology of ERP-systems. It explains the increased importance of ERP systems in practice. The paper also addresses the difficulties encountered in implementing ERP systems in real life. Modern ERP systems are very flexible, and can be tuned to many different business environments. This flexibility leads to increased complexity. The paper explains the nature of the flexibility and the complexity. It discusses promising ways to master complexity such as enterprise modeling. Modern ERP systems are well suited for support of a multi-site enterprise. However, smooth cooperation of such systems in a supply chain of independent partners is still a long way to go.	business process;component-based software engineering;erp;enterprise modelling;enterprise resource planning;internet backbone;interoperability;logistics;loose coupling;mathematical optimization;modem;real life;robustness (computer science);transaction processing;way to go	John C.

However, these kinds of frameworks, such as Resource-Event-Agent and Open-edi, recently unified in Open-edi Business Ontology (OeBTO), lack formal representations. This fact considerably limits their use in system development, particularly in model-driven development methods where the efficiency of transformations is of great importance. In this paper we suggest a formalization of OeBTO using OMG’s standard Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), as a method for creating a servicecentric business model. This makes it possible to provide the necessary formal logic foundation to allow automatic processing of the business model and its transformation to a system-level service model. An example from the bank loan business sector is used to argument the application of the method.	enterprise system;enterprise systems engineering;model-driven engineering;semantics of business vocabulary and business rules	Jelena Zdravkovic;Iyad Zikra;Tharaka Ilayperuma	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19997-4_20	business model;business analysis;business transformation;semantics of business vocabulary and business rules;business domain;business requirements;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;software engineering;business case;process modeling;business process model and notation;business relationship management;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	Web+IR	-58.771688545648104	16.60462562112868	189399

The components are used by enterprise designers to (re)engineer particular business models. Each component represents a chunk of business knowledge on some parts of an enterprise or of some enterprise network. The repository ensures that enterprise components can be shared by the actors of the enterprise network. The meta-model that supports these models is formalized using enterprise modeling language constructs (i.e., CIMOSA business concepts). The paper presents a distributed client/server architecture to support the approach for which business servers, applications servers and client systems are discussed.	cimosa;client–server model;server (computing)	Anis Abdmouleh;Michel Spadoni;François B.

Since the complexity of the decision making process in manufacturing stems from the multilevel nature of the planning hierarchy, we emphasize the importance of adopting an integrated view of the planning hierarchy. We provide a framework for the development of a DSS for integrated manufacturing control that emphasizes a systems approach. Besides we consider some of the architectural aspects of a DSS in CIM. In particular, the specific architectural aspects of the management of data in CIM have been discussed at length.	computer-integrated manufacturing	Suranjan De;Shimon Y. Nof;Andrew B.

The methodology is oriented to facilitate obtaining requirements to design knowledge management systems and/or strategies. This approach has been applied for different purposes, including identifying relationships between the knowledge and sources involved in the activities of a process, the mechanisms used for managing knowledge in those processes, and the main problems affecting the flow of knowledge. In order to exemplify the usefulness and applicability of the proposed approach, a case study is described, in which the methodology was successfully applied to analyze a software development group. From this case study different possible solutions to some problems observed in the maintenance process were proposed.	enterprise information system;exemplification;information systems;knowledge base;knowledge management;linear algebra;management system;process (computing);requirement;software development	Oscar M.

5a64181baef00b7dc849ec116369700f0328cf0e	model transfer among case tools in systems engineering		Systems engineering as a core discipline of technical product development uses a variety of different Computer-Aided Systems Engineering (CASE) tools. Very often the need arises for data transfer between such tools. Currently, due to insufficient interface formats, a labor-intensive manual transfer of data is necessary. A step towards improving data exchange between systems engineering tools along the process life cycle is the definition of standard interface formats such as the application protocol (AP) framework of ISO Standards for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP). The aim of this paper is to analyze and evaluate the implementations of the Systems Engineering Data Representation and Exchange Standard (SEDRES/AP233) information model with regard to supporting data exchange, to propose improvements for the emerging modular AP233 ISO standard and to provide solutions for the observed problems. The solutions proposed in this paper were developed while designing, developing, and using a STEP ISO 10303–SEDRES conformant import and export interface for the tools Teamwork, Statemate, and the requirement management tool DOORS. The developed interfaces demonstrate that the SEDRES information model is an efficient medium for tool and vendor independent transfer of systems engineering information. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Early design intent of a designer can be propagated to down stream design activities using this knowledge as an evaluation index. In this context, a design intent management (DIM) module associated with a life-cycle assessment (LCA) inventory, a feature coding design knowledge base, and an automatic function-to-form mapping module are developed concurrently and embedded in an integrated environmentally conscious design (IECD) system being developed in the Design Technology Research Centre of School of Design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. A case study involving the design intent management module, the propagation module to follow-up design activities and a design knowledge base supporting decision making in engineering design process are presented In this work.

This paper presents a first analysis toward the improvement of collaborative design process taking into account the maturity of exchanged information. We propose a characterisation of collaborative design situations, a characterisation of exchanged information and a description of the collaborative design framework.

Recently, there have been efforts to address issues related to production planning; however, most of them focus on the process and business/management aspects of production planning, and not much emphasis is given to technical issues such as deciding features that will be made as core assets and their granularity. In this paper, we introduce a feature-based approach to product line production planning and illustrate how our approach addresses these technical issues. In our approach, a feature model and feature binding information are used as primary input to production plan development. A product line production plan developed using our approach could be easily customized to a product-specific production plan, because it was developed with consideration of units of product configurations as well as their integration techniques.	feature model;name binding;neural binding;requirement	Jaejoon Lee;Kyo Chul Kang;Sajoong Kim	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-28630-1_11	production line;systems engineering;engineering;operations management;software development;business process;management;engineering drawing;new product development;grain size	AI	-59.17641371163196	11.965385591922448	193354

The paper motivates the use of graph-rewriting for design automation and highlights an important issue: preservation of confidentiality. Approaches to the efficient derivation (using design knowledge) and rule induction (learning design knowledge) are discussed. The crucial feature of these approaches for confidentiality-preserving graph-rewriting is that knowledge-bases of contributing organizations do not have to be disclosed.		Julian R. Eichhoff;Felix W.

9022bc2eb3c7c6b5a960917d3da0b0deda9dd91e	automating services for spacecraft conceptual design via an enterprise service bus		As space system designs are growing more complex and market demands bigger, technical issues related to concept development become more important and difficult. Moreover, due to pressure on cost and time, many space projects nowadays demand distribution as they undergo their development divided among several project partners, sometimes temporally and geographically separated hampering the information exchange and causing adding risks to its conception. This key phase maps client needs to product use functions and is where functional architecture (and sometimes the physical architecture) is decided upon. Typically, the design specifications and constraints impose a heavy burden on systems-of-systems engineering. This paper shows how some processes of the space mission conceptual phase can be standardized and automated using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm. By employing an enterprise bus service (ESB), named SpaceESB, applications become distributed and its reuse promoted.	enterprise service bus	Ariana C.

74e4edd9c75ef53ffc6e02763aece584730046d3	weaving social software features into enterprise resource planning systems		In this paper we present the Social Weaver platform that enables end users to weave snippets of social software features into the workflows of existing enterprise applications. We discuss the underlying vision from a technological viewpoint, i.e., an end-user development viewpoint, and an organizational viewpoint which is about a certain ubiquitous understanding of enterprise application integration. We present the system’s requirements, architecture and realization. The concrete platform is based on the standard web technology stack, which makes sense because the web is the current natural host for enterprise applications, at least for new ones. However, the approach presented in this article is technological-independent with the concrete platform as a concrete instance proving the approach as doable. Conceptually, the realized platform is a key to analyze the current situation and possible future of today’s enterprise application landscapes which oscillate between emerging social software metaphors and an ever increasing degree of process automation found in today’s organizations.	enterprise resource planning	Dirk Draheim;Michael Felderer;Viktor Pekar	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-07055-1_18	functional software architecture;enterprise system;enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;systems engineering;knowledge management;social software engineering;operations management;business;human resource management system;enterprise planning system;enterprise information system;enterprise life cycle	Robotics	-57.90328159238751	17.108638205186534	194711

However, there is little evidence of efforts to align security requirements with security mechanisms. This paper extends the Secure Tropos methodology to enable a clear alignment, between security requirements and security mechanisms, and a reasoning technique to optimise the selection of security mechanisms based on these security requirements and a set of other factors. The extending Secure Tropos supports modelling and analysis of security mechanisms; defines mathematically relevant modelling concepts to support a formal analysis; and defines and solves an optimisation problem to derive optimal sets of security mechanisms. We demonstrate the applicability of our work with the aid of a case study from the health care domain.

d58ceb4f6f73b2544df43e1efcb3e20daa1457ad	narratives: composing and controlling persistent assistants to communicate, integrate, and automate multidisciplinary design and analysis		We discuss an approach in which engineers formally and iteratively construct information representations, called Perspectives, from information in other Perspectives using personal computational assistants, called Perspectors. Engineers can select from predefined, reusable, Perspectors, or program new Perspectors, and compose them into directed acyclic graph structures, called Narratives, to quickly and accurately construct useful dependent Perspectives. The approach also formalizes simple management processes with which professionals can control the integration of their Perspectives with respect to the Perspectives on which they depend. The result is an evolving, distributed, multi-disciplinary and integrated project model. We describe one conceptual Narrative that formalizes a multidisciplinary cost-benefit analysis to help designers choose amongst sustainable strategies. We describe one implemented Narrative that automatically generates a metal decking contractor’s connection details that are needed to connect concrete slabs that are described in an architect’s model and steel beams that are described in a steel detailers model. We discuss how these Narratives could have enabled engineers to better design, communicate, integrate, and automate their design processes than is possible on a recent state-of-the-art AEC projects. Narratives are intended to enable engineers from multiple disciplines to engage in novel, automated, and integrated design and analysis by easily yet formally constructing and integrating Perspectives from other Perspectives.	directed acyclic graph;integrated project support environment	John Haymaker;Ben Suter;John C.

778a72354303f9f67428c529ab72d4cdab1354d0	defining explainable ai for requirements analysis		Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The artificial intelligence (AI) community in general, and the machine learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements? In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.	artificial intelligence;catastrophic interference;categorization;forr;formal verification;machine learning;reliability engineering;requirement;requirements analysis;transparency (graphic)	Raymond Sheh;Isaac Monteath	2018	KI - Künstliche Intelligenz	10.1007/s13218-018-0559-3	management science;artificial neural network;machine learning;decision tree;realisation;artificial intelligence;computer science;requirements analysis	AI	-62.62415271532213	17.67834091939066	197610
5cdef20b75d44de15cdbcf754265527ed2111472	ontological framework for integrating environmental issues within sustainable enterprise - enhancing enterprise decision-making		Ontologies stand for an excellent choice for building complex models while allowing a high level of flexibility, re-usability, usability and easiness of maintenance. This work proposes the re-use of an ontological model for the integrated enterprise in order to include the environmental assessment function. Since enterprises are complex systems involving different functionalities, decision-making becomes a highly challenging task, and decision process is usually separated in several levels. Nevertheless, such levels are closely related by the sharing of data and information. Therefore, effective integration among the different hierarchical levels, by means of tools which improve information sharing and communication, may play a crucial role for the enhanced enterprise operation, and consequently for fulfilling the enterprise’s goals. The ontological framework provides a common modeling framework which facilitates integration among the different decision levels, and works as the mechanism for supporting information and knowledge sharing among multiple applications. The general semantic framework developed is applied to a case study comprising an enterprise supply chain network design-planning problem which considers environmental issues.	complex systems;high-level programming language;network planning and design;ontology (information science);supply chain network;usability	Edrisi Muñoz;Elisabet Capón-García;José Miguel Laínez;Antonio Espuña Camarasa;Luis Puigjaner	2012			enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;enterprise modelling;knowledge management;integrated enterprise modeling;enterprise architecture management;management science;enterprise data management;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;enterprise planning system;enterprise information system;enterprise life cycle	AI	-58.32456662735407	13.877923618043534	197984
7772831c6216abcba6d812f842b08e9fe3e04de3	an integrated task management system to reduce semantic conflicts in multi-user computer-aided design		Simultaneous multi-user computer-aided design enables teams of designers to contribute simultaneously to the same model. As multiple users make contributions to the model, all users see additions from all other collaborators in real-time. However, without careful coordination, conflicts that violate the design intent of the model may occur. These are referred to as semantic conflicts and lead to redundant work by users. This article presents a method to reduce semantic conflicts through a task management system integrated directly into multi-user computer-aided design. Experiments were run that compare multi-user teams’ design modeling times with and without the integrated task management system. The results of these experiments show that the integrated task management system significantly reduces the time to complete design models by reducing semantic conflicts through enhanced organization and communication.	computer-aided design;multi-user	Ammon Hepworth;Keith Halterman;Brett Stone;Jared Yarn;Cynthia G Jensen	2015	Concurrent Engineering: R&A	10.1177/1063293X15573595	real-time computing;computer science;systems engineering;database	EDA	-61.179613358986664	13.712694771880503	198397

It studies the Grid-oriented knowledge description and acquisition, and constructs the  distributed Knowledge Grid model. It also deals with the protocol of node description in collaborative design, and builds  up the distributed collaborative design model. And the research on the protocol and technology of node constructing leads  to the collaborative production model of Grid Manufacturing. Finally, the framework of Grid Manufacturing is applied in the  design and manufacturing of custom artificial joint and the joint product is produced more efficiently.

Three key areas of research at the Centre, which have evolved as a result of collaboration with industrial partners from various sectors of industry, are identified as (1) decision support and optimisation, (2) design for lifecycle, and (3) design integration and co-ordination. A summary of the unique features of large made-to-order products is then presented, which includes the need for integration and co-ordination technologies. Thus, an overview of the existing integration and co-ordination technologies is presented followed by a brief explanation of research in these areas at the Engineering Design Centre. A more detailed description is then presented regarding the co-ordination aspect of research being conducted at the Engineering Design Centre, in collaboration with the CAD Centre at the University of Strathclyde. Concurrent Engineering is acknowledged as a strategy for improving the design process, however design coordination is viewed as a principal requirement for its successful implementation. That is, design co-ordination is proposed as being the key to a mechanism that is able to maximise and realise any potential opportunity of concurrency. Thus, an agentoriented approach to co-ordination is presented, which incorporates various types of agents responsible for managing their respective activities. The co-ordinated approach, which is implemented within the Design Co-ordination System, includes features such as resource management and monitoring, dynamic scheduling, activity direction, task enactment, and information management. An application of the Design Co-ordination System, in conjunction with a robust concept exploration tool, shows that the computational design analysis involved in evaluating many design concepts can be performed more efficiently through a co-ordinated approach.	central processing unit;computation;computer-aided design;concurrency (computer science);decision support system;engineering design process;information management;mathematical optimization;remote component environment (rce) (was: reconfigurable computing environment);scheduling (computing)	Graham Coates;I.

386f3a190a1ad758471000d86c5e473b4c3aefbb	towards an ontology and modeling approach for service science	systems;service system;fundamentals;dominant logic;conceptual model;service science;foundation;business and economics;ontology	Service Science is an academic discipline that investigates the organization and operation of service systems and that designs novel solutions for their innovation, engineering and management. As a new interdisciplinary field, Service Science is in need of a solid conceptual foundation that could act as a unifying paradigm for researchers having backgrounds in different disciplines. Apart from common research abstractions and a shared vocabulary, the field would also benefit from modeling artifacts for studying and designing service systems. This paper reports on a research-in-progress that addresses these needs by developing a Service Science ontology, which will be elaborated as the meta-model of a new service system modeling language. The paper summarizes our current research results and contributes to the Service Science literature by presenting a new graphical conceptual model for service systems.
