Further improvement of automobile fuel efficiency, particularly with the adoption of the hybrid electric vehicle engine, will have an even more dramatic effect on fuel tax revenues in the near future. In 2003, Oregon State University in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Road User Fee Task Force began investigating a vehicle miles traveled-based alternative to the fuel tax. The culminating phase of this four year effort was the execution of a pilot test involving approximately 250 volunteer drivers. The objective of this paper is to discuss the lessons learned in the design, development, and testing of the vehicle miles traveled-based technology configuration used to support Oregon's pilot test, especially the challenges faced with the use of radio frequency identification technology to identify and collect vehicle miles traveled data from equipped vehicles.	barcode;device driver;emergence;handheld game console;rf modulator;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;virtual method table	J.

As part of the review process and to comply with the Sunshine Law, the FCHLPM employs a Professional Team to perform onsite (confidential) audits of these models. Members of the Professional Team represent the fields of actuarial science, computer science, meteorology, statistics and wind and structural engineering. The audit includes an assessment of modeler’s compliance to a set of standards and modules established by the FCHLPM. One part of these standards requires the conduct of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to the proprietary model. At the completion of the audit, the professional team provides a written report to the FCHLPM, who ultimately judges compliance by a vendor to the standards. To influence future such analyses, the Professional Team conducted a demonstration uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the FCHLPM using a Rankine-vortex hurricane wind field model and surrogate damage function. This is the first of a two-part article presenting the results of those analyses. Part 1 presents sensitivity analysis results for wind speed and loss cost, while Part 2 presents the corresponding uncertainty analysis results. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Energy-Efficient High-Performance-Computing Working-Group (EE HPC WG) Energy and Power Aware Job Scheduling and Resource Management (EPA JSRM) team conducted comprehensive interviews over the course of 2016 and 2017. In this work, we present the selection of participating sites, the motivation behind the survey, a detailed description of the questionnaire, and illustrate why getting a global view of the ongoing efforts is a major step towards more efficient systems. Job Scheduling and Resource Management is being tackled using new approaches regarding Power and Energy and has important implications for achievable center strategies. With this survey, we are laying foundations necessary to give insights in how problems and respective solutions are approached across sites and centers to allow to identify differences, similarities, solutions, and possible technology transfer across sites and centers. Upcoming work will focus on the survey responses and the analysis thereof. At the point of writing, the EPA JSRM team is in the major analysis phase of the centers' responses. By splitting the work in this fashion we achieve increased clarity in presentation and have the opportunity to generate more detailed analysis in benevolence of the community and reader.	job scheduler;job shop scheduling;schedule (project management)	Matthias Maiterth;Gregory A.

The growth in government sponsored simulatio programs has drawn engineers and scientists from ot fields. These practitioners bring valuable skills, but lack a appreciation for the historical and technical foundations simulation. The tutorial will familiarize the audience with important areas and give them an appreciation for t complexity of developing large simulations. We sugge that a need exists for academic and commercial cour that focus on this topic.

The project partners are Systems Designers plc., MARI, ICL and the Universities of Newcastle and York. The project started in April 1984 with initial funding for three years. Following a successful demonstration at the Alvey Conference in August 1987, the project has been extended for another year. It is primarily an ipse kit, in the sense that Aspect would be populated with a particular set of tools to provide a customised ipse for ultimate use. Its architecture is defined by its public tool interface used by providers of tools which will run in Aspect. This interface has three main components: the Information Base, the Human Computer interface, and the Target Interface.	alvey;human computer;icl;integrated project support environment;population;process modeling	Peter Hitchcock	1988		10.1145/75110.75120	computer science;software engineering;process modeling	Robotics	-62.44914344464795	-0.007824440515601997	162453

The traditional practice of a bulk transmission of the customers’ information to an external service provider is no longer adequate, especially in the finance and healthcare sectors. From our consultancy experience, application-to-application privacy protection technologies at the middleware layer alone are also inadequate to solve this problem, particularly when human service providers are heavily involved in the outsourced process. Therefore, we propose a layered architecture and a development methodology for enforcing end-to-end privacy control policies of enterprises over the export of personal information. We illustrate how Web services, augmented with updated privacy facilities such as Service Level Agreement (SLA), Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P), and the P3P Preference Exchange Language (APPEL), can provide a suitable interoperation platform for service outsourcing. We further develop a conceptual model and an interaction protocol to send only the required part of a customer’s record at a time. We illustrate our approach for end-to-end privacy control in service outsourcing with a Inf Syst Front (2007) 9:85–101 DOI 10.1007/s10796-006-9019-y A preliminary version of this paper appears in the 7th International Conference of Electronic Commerce (ICEC2005). We have generalized and extended our approach to service outsourcing of human intensive processes. We also found P3P more appropriate in general. P. C. K.

When the system was released to users (May 1969), it found a surprisingly ready acceptance both amongst those used to different systems and those new to multi-access working. Our experience indicates that this is not normally the case and we would consider the following as contributing factors. (1) Clearly stated objectives. (2) Straightforward commands and diagnostics. (3) No ‘current’ file (all file names are stated explicitly). (4) The simplicity of the Atlas job control language. ( 5 ) Lucid documentation. The remainder of this paper indicates the enhancements found necessary to the original system and examines the areas which, with hindsight, are now felt to be sensitive in the implementation.	compiler;documentation;job control language;lucid	R.

On its own, open-source software lacks essential ingredients for mainstream adoption. Commercial businesses tied to open-source packages provide these ingredients and help drive open-source packages into the mainstream. At the same time, they provide additional resources for developing the free components of the software. Most open-source projects start out with a single programmer solving a personal problem and making the solution available to others. The early adopters of an open-source package tend to be like the creator: sophisticated programmers with a particular problem that the open-source package solves. These people can tolerate the risk of using a package without much documentation or support, and they are happy to help improve the package so that it better meets their needs. However, the most successful open-source packages fill a much broader need that goes beyond the core community of sophisticated programmers. As the user community for an open-source package grows, it eventually becomes dominated by mainstream corporate users who have less risk tolerance and are often not sophisticated programmers. These users have different needs than the core developer community, and open-source packages don’t usually meet all their needs. For example, open-source packages typically have weak documentation and often lack introductory or tutorial material. They are often packaged inconveniently, requiring compilation or configuration to install. Development tools are often missing. Informal support may be available through a mailing list or network news group, and the quality is often excellent, but there is no guarantee that any particular problem will be resolved quickly. As an open-source package becomes more and more popular, a widening gap develops between the needs of the user community and the features provided by the core developers. Eventually, commercial ventures will form to fill this gap. The user community will demand the additional services and offer to pay for them, so the business opportunities eventually become irresistable.

We present a semantic framework for reasoning about the capabilities of IoT devices based on provenance information collected from devices and their associated services. As part of this framework we have developed a semantic model, services and a smartphone app to represent, store and query IoT provenance. The semantic model and app was informed via a series of participatory design activities with users. In this paper we discuss the use of the system with two distinct IoT devices: an NFC tag used at bus stops to provide a means to access real-time bus timetables, and a blackbox device installed into vehicles by insurance companies to track driving behaviour.

On the service science side, the concept of co-creation has appeared. On the social design side, methodologies of participatory systems analysis have emerged. Based on these developments, this paper proposes a participatory systems analysis model for public policy design (PSP), a new methodology that employs Bayesian network modelling. We select Fukushima, one of the northeastern areas of Japan most devastated by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 11th March 2011, to verify and validate the empirical efficacy of this methodology. The results show that it fosters both creativity and a sense of collaborative ownership of policy design, which are the core values for a better community.	bayesian network;bottom-up proteomics;connection-oriented ethernet;emergence;social system;systems design	Toshiyuki Yasui;Seiko Shirasaka;Takashi Maeno	2014	IJCIS	10.1504/IJCIS.2014.066337	computer science;engineering;civil engineering;bayesian network;social system;management;operations research;computer security	EDA	-58.406049226803056	-0.5054370432735537	175442

The broad market penetration with mobile devices like smart phones provides new possibilities for giving support for these kinds of tasks. This paper focuses on one particular widely-used instance of such a documentation task, namely the European Accident Report (aka Agreed Statement of Facts on Motor Vehicle Accident). Firstly we discuss the advantages of media-breakfree processing of all the relevant data. Secondly we present the client part of the application, which allows on-site documentation by any of the parties involved. Both application parts can be used for processing claims in the back office.

An appro regulatory reform can take care of the multiplicity of citizen identity for ach uniqueness in it. However, there is another case of multiplicity that e-gover encounter. Technology forms the base of e-governance and different e-gover projects use different technologies giving rise to the question of interoperability am various e-governance projects. If the multiplicity in the use of technolog e-governance is not duly taken care of it will create watertight compartments null the very purpose of unique citizen identity. There requires therefore another gover intervention for unification of hardware, software and applications for indepe databases of citizens to be compatible amongst it.	automated clearing house;care-of address;database;e-governance;interoperability;unification (computer science)	Y.

In response to the OzCHI 2013 24-hour Student Design Challenge, to design the future of email, this proposal focuses on families' use of email alongside other communication tools for managing digital possessions. The aim was to identify an approach to reduce email burden while supporting users' ability to connect with their family through a familiar platform. As this concept was designed and prototyped within 24 hours, further exploration and evaluation is recommended.	24-hour clock;binocular disparity;email;personal information management;personally identifiable information	Sarah Ellen Webber;Kayla Joanne Heffernan;Behnaz Rostami Yeganeh;Fernando Estrada;Daina Augstkalns	2013		10.1145/2541016.2541097	cloud computing;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-60.30899252507186	0.7745810626695324	188839

49fbd0898989acb106dcfe54b218364b17f44e84	network and service management	first page;service management;terrorism;project management;technology management;quality management	his is the third issue of the series on Network and Service Management that is published twice a year. The series provides articles on the latest developments in this wellestablished discipline, highlighting recent research achievements and providing insight into both theoretical and practical issues related to the evolution of the discipline from different perspectives. The series provides a forum for the publication of both academic and industrial research, addressing the state of the art, theory, and practice in network and service management. In the last editorial we mentioned that the recently established IEEE Electronic Transactions on Network and Service Management (eTNSM) had passed the first major IEEE approval, in which the proposed title, scope, and sponsorship were approved. More recently, the next and final key milestone was passed, which means that IEEE eTNSM will become a full-fledged IEEE transactions/journal from January 2007; see the editorial in the latest issue by the Editor in Chief Prof. Raouf Boutaba: http://www.comsoc.org/livepubs/etn/public/ 2006/apr/editor.html. The journal currently publishes two issues per year, and five issues have been published so far. These are freely available at present at http://www.comsoc.org/ eTNSM. Another important development for the community has been the start in the beginning of 2006 of the European EMANICS project on Management of the Internet and Complex Services. This is an EU Network of Excellence that brings together 13 research institutions active in the area of network and service management. It encompasses work areas dealing with integration (long-term vision, virtual laboratory, and testbeds), dissemination (a new European conference, electronic dissemination, training and technology transfer, open source initiatives), and joint research activities (scalable, economic, and autonomic management). For more information, visit the project site: http://www.emanics.org/. You will also find there a newsletter with community news, events, and developments that is published three times a year and to which you may subscribe if you want to receive it in “push” mode. Finally, it is worth noting that a key annual event in this area, the 2nd International Week on the Management of Networks and Services (ManWeek 2006), is to be held October 23–27, 2006 in Dublin, Ireland. This includes the well-established events MMNS, DSOM, and IPOM, and also the workshops MASE and AGNM; http://www.manweek2006.org/. Also this year there was for the first time an Integrated Network Management (INM) workshop attached to ACM SIGCOMM that took place on September 11, 2006 in Pisa Italy. We again experienced overwhelming interest in the third issue, receiving 17 submissions. All these submissions were subject to three independent reviews, and we finally selected four articles, resulting in an acceptance rate of 23.5%. Reviews for the first article in which the first Series Editor, Prof. Pavlou, is a co-author were independently handled by the second series editor, Dr. Pras. We intend to maintain our rigorous review process in future issues, thus maintaining the high quality of the published articles. The first article, “A Methodological Approach toward the Refinement Problem in Policy-Based Management Systems” by Rubio-Loyola, Serrat, Charalambides, Flegkas, and Pavlou, provides first an introduction to policy refinement and the importance of establishing policy hierarchies, and then presents a relevant methodology that is validated through a holistic scenario applied to the quality of service management domain. The second article, “Decentralized Service Level Monitoring Using Network Threshold Crossing Alerts” by Wuhib, Stadler, and Clemm, presents a network monitoring architecture and protocol in which information is aggregated across managed devices, providing the capability to implement in real-time network-wide threshold crossing alerts. Applicability examples are also presented. The third article, “Managing Fast Aggregation Networks for Fast Moving Users” by Van Quickenborne, De Greve, De Turck, and Demeester, argues that a hierarchical wired Ethernet aggregation network together with Ethernet-based wireless access networks is a suitable approach for providing broadband access to fast moving users (e.g., in trains). Finally, the fourth article, “Managing Agility through Service Orientation in an Open Telecommunication Value Chain” by Bastiaansen and Hermans, describes a strategy for managing commercial and operational agility in an open telecommunication value chain, focusing on openness and reusability for providing such agility in deregulated and competitive telecommunication environments. We hope that readers of this issue find again the articles informative, and we will endeavor to continue with similar issues in the future. We would finally like to thank all the authors who submitted articles to this series, and the reviewers for their valuable feedback and comments on the articles.	access network;autonomic computing;comment (computer programming);display resolution;holism;in the beginning... was the command line;information;internet access;open-source software;openness;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;refinement (computing);scalability;testbed;whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless access point	George Pavlou;Jürgen Schönwälder	2006	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2017.7823361	computer network;value-added network;network management;service delivery framework;common management information protocol;element management system;network management station;fcaps;customer service assurance;business	Visualization	-59.28546004331899	-1.1390102631966539	191971
4096a8480472cc9b98fd7758b4ca056a2d36c506	ecg biometrics: principles and applications		Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals have several properties that can greatly complement the existing, and more established biometric modalities. Some of the most prominent properties are the fact that the signals can be continuously acquired using minimally intrusive setups, are not prone to produce latent patterns, and provide intrinsic liveliness detection, opening new opportunities within the area of biometric systems development. The potential impact of this technique extends to a broad variety of application domains, ranging from the entertainment industry, to digital transactions. In this paper, we present a framework for ECG biometrics, with focus on some of the latest developments and future trends in the field, covering multiple aspects of the problem with the aim of a real-world deployment. Our results so far, further reinforce the feasibility and interest of the method in a multibiometrics approach.	add-ons for firefox;android;application domain;biometrics;computer;fingerprint;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;laptop;mobile phone;prototype;software deployment;software development process;throughput;virtual world;waveform;web typography	Hugo Silva;André Lourenço;Filipe Canento;Ana L.

To manage its allocations processes, XSEDE developed the XSEDE Resource Allocations System (XRAS). With XRAS, XSEDE handles more than 200 allocation requests at each of its quarterly allocation meetings, along with more than 200 startup, education, and other requests received continually. XRAS was developed as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) tool, with the goal of allowing other organizations to leverage XSEDE's investment for the national research computing infrastructure. After being deployed for XSEDE in 2014, XRAS was adopted as the production allocations systems for the Computational and Information Systems Lab (CISL) at NCAR in 2015. It is also being used by the CADENS project at NCSA to request research visualizations.	computation;national center for supercomputing applications;software as a service	Rob Light;Alina Banerjee;Ester Soriano	2018		10.1145/3219104.3229238	leverage (finance);supercomputer;management science;business;resource allocation;information system;software as a service	AI	-62.771613839540414	1.1423416037329808	195539

The augmentation of societies requires a new type of media that can carry a wide variety of intellectual resources, replicate themselves, recombine themselves, and be naturally selected by their environment. They may be called """"meme media"""", since they carry what R. Dawkins (1976) called """"memes"""". An accumulation of memes in a society forms a meme pool that functions like a gene pool. When economic activities are introduced, a meme pool becomes a meme market. Meme pools and meme markets bring about the rapid accumulation of memes and require new technologies for their management and retrieval. This paper reviews our R&D on meme media, meme pools and meme markets, and proposes an overall vision to integrate them. It also proposes a new framework called 'Topica' for organizing and accessing the huge accumulation of intellectual resources in our societies."""	meme	Yuzuru Tanaka;Jun Fujima	2000		10.1109/DLRP.2000.942199	engineering;knowledge management;management;commerce	HCI	-59.74416200479471	3.4932607928121753	196133

Accordingly the portal provides an aggregated view of e-Transactions performed through e-Governance applications implemented including, but not limited to, the national-level mission mode projects (MMPs) under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP). The dashboard also facilitates quick analysis of data of various applications in tabular as well as graphical form enabling users to drill down to the lowest level of detail without compromising security and integrity of the servers from where data has been captured.  The present system deals with quantitative analysis only, whereas, plan is afloat to develop eTaal 2.0 to address the qualitative aspects of service delivery, thereby, bringing in the concept of 'QUANTILITY', which means 'QUANTIty' with 'quaLITY'.	digital library;e-governance;e-government;graphical user interface;itil;informatics;level of detail;network interface controller;real-time clock;real-time transcription;table (information)	Shefali S.

65ddf90966ad6e621c2b614fdbd4d5689a38965e	multiagent system technologies		Despite the significant attention being given to the critical problems of cyber security, the ability to keep up with the increasing volume and sophistication of network attacks is seriously lagging. Throwing more computing horsepower at fundamentally-limited visualization and analytic approaches will not get us anywhere. Instead, we need to seriously rethink the way cyber security tools and approaches have been conceived, developed, and deployed. IHMC is taking advantage of the combined strengths of humans and software agents to create new capabilities for Network Operations Centers (NOCs). These capabilities are being implemented in a new cyber defense framework called Sol. Our objective is to enable distributed sensemaking, rapid detection of threats, and effective protection of critical resources. Specifically, we use agents, policies, and visualization to enact coactive emergence as a sensemaking strategy for taskwork and teamwork, and we implement capabilities for organic resilience and semantically-rich policy governance as a means of assuring effective and adaptive human-agent team response. IHMC has applied its long years of experience with software agents to the design of a new agent framework called Luna. Luna agents function both as interactive assistants to analysts and as continuously-running background aids to data processing and knowledge discovery. Luna agents achieve much of their power through built-in teamwork capabilities that, in conjunction with IHMC’s KAoS policy services framework, allow them to be proactive, collaborative, observable, and directable. In order to support dynamic scalability and other features of the Sol framework, the Luna platform supports the policy-governed option of allowing the state of agents (vs. code of agents) to migrate between operating environments and hosts. We believe that the approach to cyber defense embodied in Sol is equally relevant to applications of distributed sensemaking for other kinds of complex high-tempo tasks such as real-time disease control or disaster management.	agent-based model;approximation algorithm;built-in self-test;common criteria;computer security;converge;emergence;iterated function;iteration;kaos;luna;microsoft outlook for mac;multi-agent system;nash equilibrium;observable;population;q-learning;real-time locating system;reinforcement learning;scalability;sensemaking;software agent	LNAI Founding	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33690-4		ML	-61.735580869489475	2.8944066150402175	198077

The first product was to be a line of high-speed printers, the second a card reader, and the third a card reader/punch. An Optical Bar Code Reader was in parallel development under a contractual commitment. This machine later developed into a line of machines which, strictly speaking, cannot be considered basic peripherals.	barcode reader;card reader;peripheral	Earl Masterson	1966		10.1145/1464182.1464219	embedded system;computer hardware;engineering;engineering drawing	EDA	-58.631922694293955	1.0911935231013594	199494
