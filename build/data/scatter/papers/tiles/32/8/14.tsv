The proposal aims at tackling unjustified “restrictions on the free movement of data” among Member States. This paper analyses a number of cloud challenges of trustworthy inter-cloud environments identified by on-going EU-funded research initiatives dealing with security, privacy and data protection issues of Cloud solutions. © 2016 The Authors.

cde704aedfddb884045132a4db83ccce856d200e	perspectives in business informatics research		We describe a new recommender system for the Russian interactive radio network FMhost. The underlying model combines collaborative and user-based approaches. The system extracts information from tags of listened tracks for matching user and radio station profiles and follows an adaptive online learning strategy based on user history. We also provide some basic examples and describe the quality of service evaluation methodology.	algorithm;business informatics;mathematical optimization;quality of service;radio broadcasting;recommender system;scalability;systems architecture	Michael J.

Out of 114 papers submitted, 19 were accepted. Having been asked by one of the editors-in-chief to select some papers for a special issue on ESORICS 2003, I was faced with a difficult task. However, I have chosen five papers from the conference, covering issues such as design and security, theory for security analysis, a technique for analysis of crypto protocols, security analysis of an anonymity system and the application of formal methods in the design of a smart card memory management system. These papers cover a broad area, but have one aspect in common – they all contribute towards an increased understanding of how to assess or improve security strength. The papers in this special issue are extended versions of the papers presented at ESORICS 2003.	formal methods;memory management;smart card	Einar Snekkenes	2004	International Journal of Information Security	10.1007/s10207-004-0054-8	theoretical computer science;model checking;information security;computer science	EDA	-60.44997488747023	-3.42467365231305	166383

In this paper an original Image-Data Manager/Archiver (O3-DPACS) and a universal Image-Data Display (HDW2) are described. O3-DPACS is also part of a new project called Open Three (O3) Consortium, promoting Open Source adoption in e-health at European and world-wide levels. This project aims to give a contribution to the development of e-health through the study of Healthcare Information Systems and the contemporary proposal of new concepts, designs and solutions for the management of health data in an integrated environment: hospitals, Regional Health Information Organizations and citizens (home-care, mobile-care and ambient assisted living).

The Decision Strategies Department’s “experts at talking to experts” collaborative research process is discussed, as are some of the techniques the department employs to make this research approach interesting and enjoyable for their “decision event” participants, as well as effective at generating the research data necessary to address the decision maker or research sponsor’s questions. The paper describes how this research approach evolved, why it is different from traditional research or war gaming, and the type of research requirements that caused this approach to be developed. The paper discusses the lessons learned from using this research process, and some of the ways that the department disseminates the results of its work. Also discussed are two DSD research projects that illustrate different approaches to this type of collaborative research, and that contain examples of techniques that can even make this type of collaborative research fun!	data structure diagram;decision theory;document structure description;requirement	Carl G.

Tigra developed a distributed system architecture for integrating different financial front-office trading applications with middleand back-office applications. We discuss the detailed requirements that led us to adopt a judicious combination of object-oriented middleware and markup languages. In this combination an object request broker implements reliable trade data transport. Markup languages, particularly the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), are used to address semantic data integration problems. We show that the strengths of middleware and markup languages are complementary and discuss the synergies yielded by deploying middleware and markup. W. Emmerich and S.

India's faulty infrastructure, which hobbles collaboration among scientists there, is discussed. The problems surrounding China's outdated equipment, which sometimes forces its researchers to construct paper machines to study computing problems, are described. The prospects of the United Nation's International Institute for Software Technology (IIST), which opened in Macau in the Summer of 1992, are reviewed.<<ETX>>	computer science	David K.
