ISE uses a synergistic combination of leading-edge technologies, including high performance computing, high-capacity communications and networking, virtual product development, knowledge-based engineering, computational intelligence, human-centered computing, and product information management. The environment will link scientists, design teams, manufacturers, suppliers and consultants who participate in the mission synthesis, as well as in the creation and operation of the aerospace system. It will radically advance the process by which complex science missions are synthesized, and high-tech engineering systems are designed, manufactured and operated. The human-centered computing, infrastructure for distributed collaboration, rapid synthesis and simulation tools, and life cycle integration and validation are described.	american and british english spelling differences	Ahmed K.

Thus, the productivity and cost of the system are also determined. The approach of the Assisted Engineering aims to integrate experience and knowledge of existing manufacturing systems in the engineering process. For this purpose, these systems are modularized and systematically integrated into a knowledge base. This knowledge base allows a more efficient engineering process by reusing mechatronic modules. Thereby, the performance of a manufacturing system can be substantiated at an early stage of engineering. The approach described in this paper aims at increasing the reusability of such modules. For this, the modularization of existing systems is optimized so that the modules are not too specific for reuse in the development of a new manufacturing system.	knowledge base;mechatronics	Michael Weyrich;Philipp Klein	2012	Proceedings of 2012 IEEE 17th International Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2012)	10.1109/ETFA.2012.6489660	productivity;mechatronics;process development execution system;system of systems engineering;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;methods engineering;artificial intelligence;instrumentation and control engineering;computer-integrated manufacturing;advanced manufacturing;activity-based costing;production engineering;manufacturing engineering;computer engineering	DB	-57.12980266789665	10.61390364035573	186764

First, the technique must be understood. That is, there must exist mathematical models of the technique's performance which have been experimentally verified. Second, the relation between the technique and other manufacturing processes with which it will work must be understood so that the new technique can be integrated with the rest of the factory. As these steps are accomplished for more processes, integrated factories of a new kind will emerge.	automation;experiment;mathematical model	James L. Nevins;Daniel E.

The paper describes the current standardization efforts for SDR technologies in Europe and the related certification processes. The regulatory and technical requirements for the certification of SDR and its components are defined in this paper. The paper presents the study on the development of a European SDR certification procedure through a network approach. Finally, we describe the Waveform Libraries and Issue Tracking System, which are an essential part of the certification process.

While the knowledge base in an expert system serves as a storehouse of knowledge primitives, its design and development is a bottleneck in the expert system development lifecycle. Therefore the development of an automated knowledge acquisition (KA) facility (or KA tool) would facilitate the implementation of expert systems for any domain. This paper describes an automated KA tool that helps to elicit and store information in domain-specific knowledge bases for surface-mount PWB assembly. A salient feature of this research is the acquisition of uncertain information.	expert system;knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;printed circuit board;printing;surface-mount technology;wiring	Chien-Hsing Wu;K.

Research in design and manufacturing systems is needed now more then ever in the past. Yet, the CAD industry, on the whole, has not invested in such research. On the other hand, most companies prefer to buy solutions, such as they did in the past with drafting systems. Thus, we face a dilemma: industry asks vendors, “What do you have to offer?” Vendors respond with, “What are you willing to buy?”	computer-aided design	Michael J.

The scope of the research enhances the elaboration of the method of reengineering the production process with the support of simulation. Authors present the background of the research including the comparative analysis of five different reengineering methodologies. On analysis, the conclusion is defined that there is a gap in reengineering methodologies since they do not account for industry-based requirements for simulation. To fulfill this gap the Petri nets application for simulation was proposed. Authors discuss the most distinctive elements of a Petri net and define the methodology of manufacturing processes modeling. The obtained output was not sufficient to make a final decision about the real reengineering process. Therefore, an additional analysis with Rapid RE (Rapid Reengineering) methodology was performed. The proposal of the potential hybrid solution combining the advantages of both methods, i.e. Petri Net and Rapid Re, is presented.	code refactoring;petri net;qualitative comparative analysis;requirement;simulation	Pawel Pawlewski;Paulina Golinska-Dawson;Marek Fertsch;Jesús A.

Today, markets increasingly require more customized products, with shorter life cycles. In response, manufacturing systems have evolved from mass production techniques, through flexible automation, and to mass customization to produce ‘one-of-a-kind production’ at mass production costs. This paper argues that manufacturing systems of the next generation will have to incorporate more flexibility and intelligence, evolving towards reconfigurable manufacturing systems. In particular, the concept of ‘intelligence’ becomes more relevant because of the need to maintain effective and efficient manufacturing operations with minimum downtime under conditions of uncertainty. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the field of reconfigurable and intelligent machines.

Nowadays, more and more industrial equipment companies are expanding IIoT by creating complex systems that integrate sensors, processors and communication to create intelligent factories, smart grids and even smart cities. For this purpose, the authors have designed an intelligent-gateway IP implemented on an All-Programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) that brings the new technology into the manufacturing sector of the IIoT. It has been validated by tests in an industrial company, during usual operation. Developments like this increase productivity and profitability, as well as enrich lives, by contributing safety, intercommunication and real-time remote control.	central processing unit;complex systems;internet of things;mpsoc;real-time transcription;remote control;sensor;smart city;system on a chip	Armando Astarloa;Unai Bidarte;Jaime Jimenez;Aitzol Zuloaga;Jesús Lázaro	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793890	simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	-60.77766608129643	8.747556899685696	195862

30d7a488bd8e6c8caa8f388f99e5c85b1ee4aa64	research on the application of rfid technology in logistics warehousing management system		With the rapid development of Internet of Things technology matures, the application of Internet of Things technology in logistics warehousing management can effectively improve the efficiency of warehousing management. This paper introduces the warehouse management and RFID technology, and analyses problems of the RFID technology used in logistics warehousing management. Aiming at solving the problem, a new type of RFID system based on EPC system, ONS service, PML service, GIS technology and GPS technology is put forward. In addition, it was successfully applied to the warehouse management of WT enterprise, and the workflow of the system was introduced in detail. The key to build the cargo in-out warehouse dynamic mathematical model of distribution based on the corresponding algorithm was improved to solve the problem of cargo distribution. The system can realize the intelligent management of the warehouse, to further promote the application of Internet of things technology in logistics warehousing management.
