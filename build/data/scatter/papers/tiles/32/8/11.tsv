We present a system, called Minerva, able to automatically organize virtual museums, given the set of works of art and the environments in which they must be displayed, and to support the user in the visit and fruition of these museums. Minerva has been experimentally implemented in two different versions: the first one arranges archeological finds for allocation in historical buildings; the second one arranges design objects for allocation in imaginary virtual environments.	agent-based model;applications of artificial intelligence;experiment;imaginary time;multi-agent system;virtual reality	Francesco Amigoni;Viola Schiaffonati	2004	Intelligenza Artificiale		simulation;organ culture;computer science;knowledge management;cultural heritage;virtual machine;artificial intelligence;multimedia	AI	-59.59649950383572	-28.966847178663855	156340

It includes much more than a description of massive power failures, ranging from the well-known blackouts to brownouts and greenouts, and people’s immediate reactions to the various shades of dark caused by them. Rather, it uncovers blackouts as a technical problem based on political and economic decisions, a military strategy, an urban crisis, and the ensuing darkness as a social construction and phenomenon of collective perception with its repercussions on memory and aestheticization. And it traces the changing meaning of blackouts to those who experienced them in the United States. In other words, this book is one convincing argument for the claim that there is much to see for those who peer into the darkness. And after 25 years of research on Electrifying America, Consuming power, the technological sublime, Technology and new beginning, (Nye, 1990; 1994; 1998; 2003) and other aspects touching on the subject, David Nye well knows how to open our eyes to it. It all began with the grid, one might argue, with the replacement of small power providers by one, finally national, network of linked-up power stations. Without it, blackouts were local, very limited in their effects on households, not a collective experience of memorable impact. One might even start earlier than that and date the birth of the modern blackout experience back to the moment when electricity had become so closely interwoven with the processes of daily life that its sudden unexpected absence threw people off course. For the United States, as Nye tells us, this moment had come by 1930, at least to the urban centers. While electrical light invested cities with structure and distinctiveness at night, thus providing a heightened sense of security for the inhabitants, it created a new readability of urban space that made the city vulnerable in wartime. In the 1930s, people began to use the term blackout regularly, referring to intentional hiding of illumination as a protective measure—and also referring to an act of withholding information. Even without power outages, the phenomenon made its way into everyday life, since blackout drills became a common experience in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Japan in that decade. After the outbreak of World War II, even the U.S. population lived through voluntary shutdowns of electric supply, either for military reasons or, another wartime innovation, as a concomitant of strikes. And war brought yet another addition, the first major brownouts. They were introduced by the government initiated to save coal, when the German planes expected to attack American cities did not materialize. All of these forms of power cuts were intentional and necessary. In the postwar era, with a demand of electrical power doubling every 10 years in the United States, blackouts were no longer planned but accidents. A new usage of the term emerged, describing them as comprehensive failures of the power system enforcing a standstill, a kind of suspended animation disrupting the functioning of society. The great blackout of 1965, affecting the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, came as exactly that, that is, a powerful form of negation. Most notable is the effect it had on people and their perception of blackouts—as notable as that of the two other major blackouts in 1977 and 2003 that so graphically illustrate the spectrum of reactions to unwanted power outages. In the 1960s urban Americans regarded the blackout as a violation of the order	collective intelligence;international standard book number;northeast blackout of 2003;period-doubling bifurcation;sublime text;tracing (software);uninterruptible power supply;whole earth 'lectronic link;yet another	Angela Schwarz	2012	Inf.

Likewise, we suggest that the ways in which digital technologies are said to shape experiences of time need to be understood in the context of the fractured routines of the modern Western world. We argue that """"redesigning"""" these experiences necessitates a broader way of dealing with the temporal structures of social life.

7d0ff7f327d72f7cda83355658b5fd29a7319525	historical streetscape simulation system that reflects changes in weather, time, and seasons		In this study, we developed a historical streetscape simulation system for local areas. In recent years, the loss or replacement of regional history and culture has become a pertinent issue in Japan owing to urbanization, depopulation, declining birthrate, and aging population. Based on the cultural property law, measures are being taken to conserve and use cultural properties depending on characteristics such as tangible cultural property, intangible cultural property, folk cultural property, monument, cultural landscape, and traditional building group. However, with changes in social environments, the historical culture of an area that was previously cultivated and conveyed through the long history of local residents has now become difficult to inherit. In particular, things that have not been designated as cultural properties get buried or lost in society. To mitigate this problem, this study focuses on the historical cultural landscape of local areas and develops a landscape simulation system for communicating and inheriting the same in an easy-to-understand manner. Attempts have previously been made to reproduce historical landscapes by real-time rendering with 3D computer graphics (CG) and virtual reality technology [Fukuda et al. 2015; Boeykens. 2011]. However, owing mainly to hardware limitations for drawing, these systems focused on single buildings; they did not reproduce city-level dynamics. Meanwhile, studies were conducted to achieve urban-scale reproductions [Dylla et al. 2008; Jacobson. 2005]. Because such large-scale developments are costly, only famous places are typically selected as target areas. In a previous study, we have already developed a historical landscape simulation system for the streetscape of the late Edo period. This system was installed as a permanent exhibition at regional museums, where it has been running stably. In the present study, we aim to extend the scale of this system in response to user requests and feedback.

0788ff5511d257c96f07b1d3a2f6ef79a69684c3	humane representation of thought: a trail map for the 21st century	dynamic representations	New representations of thought -- written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc -- have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity's collectively-thinkable territory. But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.  Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But less obviously, and more importantly, it is enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.  We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.  But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities -- all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding -- instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.  This talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.	emulator;graphics;infographic;mind;mind–body problem;unbalanced circuit	Bret Victor	2014		10.1145/2660252.2661746	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-57.3085930191748	-27.388379590806153	158697

What are the challenges for ‘Augmented Reality technologies that enhance physical reality by layering interactive computer-generated content to it when used as an artistic medium? While the underlying technologies (tracking, displaying and rendering) that drive augmented reality focus on a transparent creation, distribution and access of information the artist should critically examine their implementation. V2_Lab considers the artistic Research and Development (aRt&D) as an important element that can introduce specific qualities in the field of technological innovation and realization. Especially in the interdisciplinary collaboration with engineers and computer scientists, the artistic approach is unconventional in connecting different research fields, leaving behind discipline-specific paradigms. A key question in the creation of an art project is: what should the work communicate and what should the audience experience? Cinema could be an interesting case study, it has stimulated our imagination for more than a century and numerous successive media strive towards achieving a resembling experience in their audience: a cinematic impact. Nowadays cinema is everywhere, especially outside the confines of the movie theatre: it exists in all manner of altered forms and has become moreover an essential aspect of contemporary art. The interest that artists have in cinema is nothing new: it can be trace back to the early twentieth-century avantgardes who explored the possibilities of film and initiated the continuing interaction between art and cinema. What is this particular experience we describe as ‘cinematic’ that attracts us to the movie theatre? In his book from 1916, The Photoplay A Psychological Study, Hugo Münsterberg states: “Everybody knows from his own experience that there is a sharp and specific analogy between the film forms and the mental mechanism by which consciousness functions on all its levels.” In order to emerge, the cinema illusion asks for imagination. Film functions as a trigger for the mental processes that generate the true inner illusion. Film fused the magical way of creating movement introduced by the optical illusion toys with the qualities of photography to capture and represent reality. This merger shifted the attention of watching movement depicted to an expressive way of creating illusions by framing the world, structuring time and linking one experience to the next with sensations of images and sounds in space and time. Only later did the world in front of the camera became a constructed one, based on adopted elements of narration, stage play and music from theatre, opera and Vaudeville. A fabricated mise en scène to appeal the human imagination chimerically: unreal, imaginary and visionary. The present accelerated progress of information technologies are inevitably defining new directions of how moving images will be experienced in the future, going beyond the viewing constellation of today and changing the relation between the creator, his tools and the viewer. Digital media do not represent, they generate. They are software rather than hardware and unlike any other medium we have ever known, ephemeral: transforming and growing systems in itself. The virtual tool becomes a (re-)active actor in the creation of dynamic processes and demands for different approaches to those from the era of mimicking media.	augmented reality;cinema 4d;computer scientist;computer-generated holography;consciousness;digital media;dreams;framing (world wide web);google art project;hgnc;imaginary time;opera (web browser);toys;unreal	Boris Debackere	2010		10.1109/ISMAR.2010.5643542	augmented reality;computer-mediated reality;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;mixed reality;multimedia;cinematography;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-56.19154929147654	-29.020264663223035	159171

MMPWs provide environments that allow real-time interaction among hundreds or even thousands of users distributed across the Internet. In these worlds, the concept of persistence is crucial: the world continues to change and develop whether or not any particular subscriber is logged into it. Time passes and actions have consequences that affect others over extended periods. In addition to providing a greater sense of immersion, this persistence fosters an ongoing sense of social connection among the inhabitants. The article discusses the state of the art and likely future developments in this field. It predicts that the real and virtual worlds will merge once innovation blurs the boundary between them.	many-worlds interpretation	Robert Gehorsam	2003	IEEE Computer	10.1109/MC.2003.1193233	games;entertainment;application software;the internet;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;computer animation;multimedia;programming language;cultural diversity;robustness	Vision	-55.64248680363137	-29.747345880553887	159599
577363b3f2e593b349f409a8c6996b8359dfcf3c	robots in the home: what might they do?		Robots are coming, but what does this mean for ordinary folks? First of all, don’t believe all the hype. Lots of hobbyists and small ventures would have you believe that robots are already here, capable of a wide variety of interactions, including healthcare and monitoring medication compliance, security monitoring, education, errands, and entertainment. Robots are, of course, used in manufacturing, in search-and-rescue missions, and in the military. But when we get away from industry and the military and discuss machines that are reasonably priced, most of these so-called applications are more imagination than reality, with unreliable mechanisms barely able to get through demonstrations. For everyday home applications, the use of robots is restricted to entertainment, vacuum cleaners, and lawn mowers. Note, however, that the definition of “robot” varies widely, often being used for anything mobile, even though controlled by a human. Personally, I would classify intelligent home appliances as robots: my coffee maker, microwave oven, dishwasher, and clothes washer and dryer have more intelligence and actuators than robot vacuum cleaners—and they are also a lot more expensive. But they don’t move around the room, which for many people disqualifies them from the label of “robot.” Given that any successful product for the home must be affordable, reliable, safe, and usable by everyday people, what might a home robot do? And what would it look like? In the home, form probably will follow function. A kitchen robot might be built into the counter space, with dishwasher, pantry, coffee maker, and cooking units all arranged so that they can communicate with one another and pass items readily back and forth. An entertainment robot might take on a humanoid appearance (as in Wow Wee’s Robosapien), or an animal-like one (as in Sony’s Aibo). And robots that vacuum or mow lawns will look like, well, vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers. Making robots work well is incredibly difficult. Their sensory apparatus is limited because sensors are expensive and interpretation (especially commonsense knowledge) is still more suited for research than deployment. Robotic arms are expensive to build and not very reliable. This limits the range of possibilities. Mowing and vacuuming? Sure. Sorting laundry? Hard, but do-able. Picking up dirty items around the home? Doubtful. How about assistants for the elderly or those who need medical supervision? This is a booming area of exploration, but I am skeptical. Today’s devices are not reliable, versatile, or intelligent enough-not yet, anyway. Moreover, the social aspects of the interaction are far more complex than the technical ones, something the technology-driven enthusiasts typically fail to recognize. Three likely directions for the future are entertainment, home appliances, and education. We can start with today’s existing devices and slowly add on intelligence, manipulative ability, and function. Start small and build. The market for robots that entertain by being cute and cuddly is already well established. The second generation of vacuum cleaners is smarter than the first. Sony’s dog gets smarter and less expensive with each new version. We don’t yet think of washing machines, microwave ovens, and coffee makers as robots, but why not? They don’t move around the house, but they are getting better and smarter every year. And when the coffee maker is connected to the pantry and dishwasher, that will be a home robot worthy of the name—same for the coupling of sorting, washing, drying, and storing clothes. Education is a powerful possibility. There is already a solid basis of educational devices that aid learning. Today’s robots can read aloud in engaging voices. They can be cute and lovable-witness the responses to the multiple quasi-intelligent animals on the toy market. A robot could very well interact with a child, offering educational benefits as well. Why not have the robot help the child learn the alphabet, teach reading, vocabulary, pronunciation, basic arithmetic, maybe basic reasoning? Why not music and art, geography and history? And why restrict it to children? Adults can be willing and active learners. Now this is a direction worthy of exploration: robot as teacher. Not to replace school, not to replace human contact and interaction, but to supplement them. The beauty here is that these tasks are well within the abilities of today’s devices. They don’t require much mobility or sophisticated manipulators. Many technologists dream of implementing Neil Stephenson’s children’s tutor in his novel The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer. Why not? Here is a worthy challenge.

Because of the resulting lack of knowledge about even the simplest debugging techniques, spreadsheet formulae and macros are riddled with bugs and million-dollar business decisions are sometimes based on calculation errors. According to Tom Landauer’s excellent book, The Trouble with Computers (MIT Press, 1995), at least 40 percent of spreadsheets have bugs. The introduction of the Web is causing a similar phenomenon in user interface design. My current estimate is that there will be about 10 billion Web pages on the Internet by the year 2001. Intranets and extranets will probably hold at least 10 times that many pages. We already have two million pages on SunWeb (the intranet at Sun Microsystems). Each Web page is a user interface design problem equal to that of a dialogue box: you must design a task flow that brings the most important items to users’ attention and design alternative options for them to click on—all the while keeping the meaning of these options clear for novice users. Considering that the world will design more than a 100 billion of these dialog-box equivalents in the next three or four years, extremely simple and inexpensive usability methods are crucial if we are to avoid a usability meltdown on the Web.	computer science;debugging;extranet;internet;intranet;landauer's principle;programmer;software bug;spreadsheet;tom;usability;user interface design;web page;world wide web;dialog	Jakob Nielsen	1997	IEEE Software	10.1109/MS.1997.595892	web service;web usability;web development;the internet;software bug;usability;web design;human–computer interaction;web standards;computer science;extranet;operating system;web navigation;web page;multimedia;software testing;user interface;web 2.0;world wide web;web testing	HCI	-62.08542720335625	-27.248569959352643	162114

Like a lasso in midair (pardon our notion of a Texas reference), the outer limits of research and practice in the CHI community seem to be getting larger and changing shape as they move along. In part this is due to the diversity of CHI, the wide collection of interests and pursuits at the intersection of people and technologies. One such interest is design research. Among HCI researchers and practitioners, there is the implicit assumption that design relates critically to HCI, yet the degree to which design constitutes research in its own right is far from agreed upon. In this issue's cover story, Bill Gaver and John Bowers take on the relationship of research to design, proposing annotated portfolios as a way to further articulate the wider concerns within the making and reception of a design artifact or collection of artifacts. Annotated portfolios aim to go beyond but respect the tacit understanding of making and respect the existence of the objects or systems themselves. Artifacts and systems are a """" position statement """" on behalf of the designers in understanding what """" is important to consider in a given design situation """" and """" how best to respond. """" Annotated portfolios, Gaver and Bowers argue, emerge from the practice of designing in which designers converse and critique their concerns in and around the things they make. The authors aim to rescue design from the impositions of (and mismatch with) scientific research, which design could certainly be put in the service of, but at the expense of design itself.

7a602ebc41a2829ffc5742bf485aedf5891234e8	computational game creativity		Computational creativity has traditionally relied on well-controlled, single-faceted and established domains such as visual art, narrative and audio. On the other hand, research on autonomous generation methods for game artifacts has not yet considered the creative capacity of those methods. In this paper we position computer games as the ideal application domain for computational creativity for the unique features they offer: being highly interactive, dynamic and content-intensive software applications. Their multifaceted nature is key in our argumentation as the successful orchestration of different art domains (such as visual art, audio and level architecture) with game mechanics design is a grand challenge for the study of computational creativity in this multidisciplinary domain. Computer games not only challenge computational creativity and provide a creative sandbox for advancing the field but they also offer an opportunity for computational creativity methods to be extensively assessed (via a huge population of gamers) through commercial-standard products of high impact and financial value. Games: the Killer App for Computational Creativity More than a decade of research in computational creativity (CC) has explored the study of autonomous generative systems in a plethora of domains including non-photorealistic art (Colton 2012), music (Wiggins et al. 1999), jokes (Binsted and Ritchie 1997), and stories (Peinado and Gervás 2006) as well as mathematics (Colton 2002) and engineering (Gemeinboeck and Saunders 2013). While commercial games have used computer generated artifacts such as levels and visuals since the early 1980s, academic research in more ambitious and rigorous autonomous game artifact generation methods, e.g. search-based procedural content generation (Togelius et al. 2011), is only very recent. Despite notable exceptions (Cook, Colton, and Gow 2013; Zook, Riedl, and Magerko 2011; Smith and Mateas 2011), the creation of games and their content has not yet systematically been explored as a computationally creative process. From a CC perspective, procedural content generation (PCG) in games has been viewed — like mathematics and engineering — as a potentially creative activity but only if done exceptionally well. The intersection of CC, game design and advanced game technology (e.g. PCG) opens up an entirely new field for studying CC as well as a new perspective for game research. This paper argues that the creative capacity of automated game designers is expected to advance the field of computational creativity and lead to major breakthroughs as, due to their very nature, computer games challenge computational creativity methods at large. This position paper contends that games constitute the killer application for the study of CC for a number of reasons. First, computer games are multifaceted: the types of creative processes met in computer games include visual art, sound design, graphic design, interaction design, narrative generation, virtual cinematography, aesthetics and environment beautification. The fusion of the numerous and highly diverse creative domains within a single software application makes games the ideal arena for the study of computational (and human) creativity. It is also important to note that each art form (or facet) met in games elicits different experiences to its users, e.g. game rules affect the player’s immersion (Calleja 2011); their fusion into the final software targeting the ultimate play experience for a rather large and diverse audience is an additional challenge for CC research. Second, games are content-intensive processes with open boundaries for creativity as content for each creative facet comes in different representations, under different sets of constraints and often created in massive amounts. Finally, the creation (game) offers a rich interaction with the user (player): a game can be appreciated as an art form or for its creative capacity only when experienced through play. The play experience is highly interactive and engaging, moreso than any other form of art. Thus, autonomous computational game creators should attempt to design new games that can be both useful (playable) and deemed to be creative (or novel) considering that artifacts generated can be experienced and possibly altered. For example, the game narrative, the illumination of a room, or the placement of objects can be altered by a player in a game; this explodes in terms of complexity when the game includes user-generated content or social dynamics in multiplayer games. Another unique property of games is that autonomous creative systems have a long history in the game industry. PCG is used, in specific roles, by many commercial games in order to create engaging but unpredictable game experiences and to lessen the burden of manual game content creation by automating parts of it. Unlike other creative domains where computational creativity is shunned by human artists and critics (Colton 2008), the game industry not only “invented” PCG but proudly advertises its presence as a selling point. Diablo III (Blizzard 2012), which set a record by selling 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release, proudly states that “[previous] games established the series’ hallmarks: randomized levels, the relentless onslaught of monsters and events in a perpetually fresh world, [...]”1. Highlyawarded Skyrim (Bethesda 2011) boasts of its Radiant A.I. (which allows for the “dynamic reaction to the player’s actions by both NPCs and the game world”) and its Radiant Story (which “records your actions and changes things in the world according to what you have done”). The prevalence of e.g. level generators in games makes both developers and end-users acceptant of the power of computational creativity. Unlike traditional art media, where CC is considered more of an academic pursuit, PCG is a commercial necessity for many games: this makes synergies between game industry and CC research desirable as evidenced by Howlett, Colton, and Browne (2010). This paper introduces computational game creativity as the study of computational creativity within and for computer games. Games can be (1) improved as products via computational creations (for) and/or (2) used as the ultimate canvas for the study of computational creativity as a process (within). Computational game creativity (CGC) is positioned at the intersection of developing fields within games research and long-studied fields within computational creativity such as visual art and narrative. To position computational creativity within games we identify a number of key creative facets in modern game development and design and discuss their required orchestration for a final successful game product. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future trends of CGC and key open research questions. Creative Facets of Games Games are multifaceted as they have several creative domains contributing substantially to the game’s look, feel, and experience. This section highlights different creative facets of games and points to instances of algorithmically created game content for these facets. While several frameworks and ontologies exist for describing elements of games, e.g. by Hunicke, Leblanc, and Zubek (2004), the chosen facets are a closer match to established creative domains such as music, painting or architecture. This section primarily argues that each facet fulfills Ritche’s definition of a potentially “creative” activity (Ritchie 2007, p.71). Additionally, it uses Ritchie’s essential properties for creativity, i.e. novelty, quality and typicality (Ritchie 2007) in terms of the goals of each creation process; whether these goals (or the greater goal of creativity) are met, however, will not be evaluated in this paper. From the official ‘What is Diablo 3?’ page at Blizzard’s website: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/game/what-is Visuals As digital games are uniformly displayed on a screen, any game primarily relies on visual output to convey information to the player. Game visuals can range from photorealistic, to caricaturized, to abstract (Järvinen 2002). While photorealistic visuals as those in the FIFA series (EA Sports 1993) are direct representations of objects, in cases where no real-world equivalent exists (such as in fantasy or sci-fi settings) artists must use real-world reference material and extrapolate them to fantastical lengths with “what if” scenarios. Caricaturized visuals often aim at eliciting a specific emotion, such as melancholy in the black and white theme of Limbo (Playdead 2010). Abstract visuals include the 8-bit art of early games, where constraints of the medium (low-tech monitors) forced game artists to become particularly creative in their design of memorable characters using as few pixels or colors as possible. In terms of computer generated visual output for games, the most commercially successful examples thereof are middleware which algorithmically create 3D models of trees with SpeedTree (IDV 2002) or faces with FaceGen (Singular Inversions 2001). Since such middleware are used by multiple high-end commercial games, their algorithms are carefully finetuned to ensure that the generated artifacts imitate real-world objects, targeting typicality in their creations. Games with fewer tethers in the real world can allow a broader range of generated visual elements. Petalz (Risi et al. 2012), for instance, generates colorful flowers which are the core focus of a flower-collecting game. Galactic Arms Race (Hastings, Guha, and Stanley 2009), on the other hand, generates the colors and trajectories of weapons in a space shooter game. Both examples have a wide expressive range as they primarily target novelty, with uninteresting or unwanted visuals being pruned by the player via interactive evolution.

Today, the critical dialog around games can approach its subject from several vectors—social, psychological, historical, aesthetic, philosophical and more. Despite the rich opportunities to discuss games, and the methodologies available to the would-be critic, the vast majority of games criticism remains produced by the review culture-bound world of game journalism. Developments in the academic world of game studies provide an approach into the emerging dialog about games as individual artifacts and their worth therein. Rather than seeing games and genres as fuel for domain and disciple specific ideological and conceptual arguments, individual games are being viewed as discrete cultural artifacts worthy of discussion, dissent, examination and dissection. Likewise, the games press corps and the gaming public express a growing interest in more experimental, intellectual and challenging game writing. Game reviewing has shown a developing maturity in the area of game criticism. Inside these twin vectors falls a conversation about game criticism. What is game criticism?

720923a67e8501c8e960f002036fe6424de0e3bf	finding design's intellectual value		“prioritize a request.” Is it a P1or an S3? Who knows? Until then, a particular matter of flawed design (badly placed controls, illogical labels, confusing flows) doesn’t exist! That’s silly. How can this system enable collegial, even salon-style debates on the assumptions or forecasts about a feature or its ability to support a persona’s lifestyle or evolve a business model? Indeed, such systems can become systematic prisons whereby the promise of creative ideas, which need the “conversational lubrication” of debate, are trapped and never seen, ushered along for the sake of triaging tickets and optimizing velocity levels—which are supposed to be techniques for coping with the madness of development in the first place. Another way in which design’s intellectual value is being subverted is the language, used in grossly simplistic ways that do not even begin to scratch the surface of deep intention and significance. Here are a few examples that drive me crazy (and perhaps you too!): • Validation. This buzzword of Lean has become the instant de facto phrase encompassing everything from “we explored some ideas with users” to “we have proved this beyond a doubt to be an absolute truth that will guarantee billions of dollars in profits”—yeah, right! Indeed, implicit in this single word is the unrealistic expectation that a novel concept has been proven scientifically to be a fundamental truth or law—which couldn’t be further from reality. All user testing involves demonstrations (not proofs) and levels of articulated feedback, with nuances around context, utility, disposition, and culture. Those nuances must be sussed out with agreed points of tolerances, trade-offs, and so forth. • Design sprints and spikes. These T hrown into the swirling currents of digital product development— either at an agile startup or a corporation “going lean”—designers must work with a variety of commercialized concepts that typify current design practice. Yet these concepts raise doubt, if not outright suspicion, about truly cultivating design depth and forethought in that practice. Validation, metrics, sprints and spikes, filing project tickets—all with an enthusiastic “bias to action” to “move fast and break things.” Woo! For new practitioners emerging from a steady diet of HCI theories and behavioral frameworks debated amid college discussion groups, this all may be somewhat jarring. For veterans in the field, it’s a matter of quick adaptation to new, albeit buzz-wordy, models of thought and vocabularies that seem a bit newfangled... and roughshod. It all suggests a dependency that infects our daily discourse with project participants, weakening our sense of design’s intellectual value: the nuances of thought, analysis, and comprehension; a robust perspective informed by deliberation and plurality. Decide it now and move fast! But why? And what impact does this language have on a team’s approach in terms of enabling design, writ large, beyond pretty pixels and specs for a minor point release? I’m not naive—at least, I try not to be. Product development is an operational context obsessed with maximizing efficiency and expediency, where decision-making with inadequately digested data is simply a natural state, a basic given for anybody involved, whether a pixel-pushing associate or a strategically savvy executive. The popular models of Lean and Agile (and their variants) package methods of rapid experimentation and programmatic execution into an expertly collaborative way of making nimble progress, predicated upon learning from actual users and improvising the execution based on those lessons (i.e., sandbox prototypes, modularized features, etc.). Awesome. Great ideals, a wonderful spirit of improving the path to successful products for eager customers—I love it! Hey, it’s way better than the traditionally sluggish, bureaucratic, silobased “waterfall” methods of the past that were far costlier and riskier, often resulting in products nobody would buy or use—the ultimate failure of all. (And not in a good way!) However, amid the mechanics that underlie such a system and the zealous devotion to such concepts, the richness, depth, and intellectual value of “design thinking” are at risk of becoming lost. Indeed, I’d suggest that the constant absorption of the Lean/Agile ethos into how we function as people promotes a kind of anti-intellectualism toward design, subverting the value of having trained, educated designers in the first place. I realize that’s quite a provocative view, so let’s take a closer look. One issue involves the notion of how “the tools we make also make us,” which implies we get caught up in the ethos of the tool, which in effect changes our behaviors to conform to the tool’s capabilities—and limitations. Web-based systems (and their mobile counterparts) that operationalize Agile, such as JIRA and Basecamp or Asana, become the dominant way of thinking that pervades a team, shapes a culture, and affects how people talk about their work.

San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1979. A spring 2010 app competition, NYC BigApps, brought together designers and developers to show how the city of New York could improve the way it provides information to its citizens. One of the 11 winning apps, “Trees Near You,” now helps users learn about the more than 500,000 trees that live on city sidewalks. For any area of New York City, one can discover tree species and calculate the environmental benefits that the trees provide, using publicly available tree census data. One of the most prevalent trees in the city, however, isn’t included [1]. Look out of any New York window, and you’re likely to see one, but you’d be hardpressed to identify it. The reason: ailanthus altissima, or the “tree of heaven”—made famous by Betty Smith’s 1943 book, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn—hasn’t technically been planted by anyone. And because its placement was unintentional, it isn’t counted in street-tree inventories. Still, it grows, and at a staggering rate of five feet per year and up to 49 feet tall. It’s these sorts of plants, and their smaller relatives, that we refer to as “weeds.” Yet to one Harvard biologist and those counting around him, they’re just “spontaneous.”	inventory;spontaneous order	Liz Danzico	2010	Interactions	10.1145/1865245.1865250	computer science	NLP	-57.55004354602062	-25.9441131174389	171050

Since the very beginning of computer science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies.

We first start with describing what multiscaling is about, how it helps perceiving signal from a background noise in a flow of data for example, for a direct perception by a user or for a further use by another program. We then give three examples of multiscale techniques we used in the past, maintaining a summary, using an environmental marker introducing an history in the data and finally using a knowledge on the behavior of the different scales to really handle them at the same time.	complex systems;dataflow;simon;simulation	Pierrick Tranouez;Antoine Dutot	2006	CoRR	10.1007/978-3-540-88073-8	computer science;artificial intelligence;operations research	AI	-55.59544815864414	-24.56256539723129	171907

We approached the task by starting with a simple scheme and adding commands and features that we felt would enhance the power of the machine. Gradually the processor became more complex. Finally the display processor came to resemble a full-fledged computer with some special graphics features. And then a strange thing happened. We felt compelled to add to the processor a second, subsidiary processor, which itself began to grow in complexity. It was then that we discovered a disturbing truth. Designing a display processor can become a never-ending cyclical process. In fact, we found the process so frustrating that we have come to call it the “wheel of reincarnation”. -: CACM V11(6) June 1968 p411	amiga reflections;graphics;reincarnation	Deepak Kumar	2009	SIGCSE Bulletin	10.1145/1709424.1709427	risk management;data science;knowledge management;computer science;data processing system;proxy (climate)	Arch	-58.741390439653024	-24.915959729245298	172536

In this paper, we describe CogentHelp, highlighting the usefulness of certain natural language generation techniques in supporting software-engineering goals for help authoring tools principally, quality and evolvability of help texts. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n CogentHelp is a prototype tool for authoring dynamically generated on-line help for applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In this paper, we describe CogentHelp, highlighting the usefulness of certain natural language generation (NLG) techniques in supporting software-engineering (SE) goals for help authoring tools principally, quality and evolvability of help texts. To our knowledge, CogentHelp is unique in that it is the first operational prototype to embody the """"evolu t ion-f r iendly"""" properties of tools in the literate programming tradition (Knuth, 1992) e.g., the by now well-known j avadoc utility for generating API documentation from comments embedded in Java source code (Friendly, 1995; cf. also Johnson and Erdem, 1995; Priestly et al., 1996; Korgen, 1996) in a tool for generating end user-level documentation. CogentHelp is also unusual in that it is (to date) one of the few tools to bring NLG techniques to bear on the problem of au thor ing dynamically generated documents (cf. Paris and Vander Linden, 1996; Knott et al., 1996; Hirst and DiMarco, 1995); traditionally, most applied NLG systems have focused on niches where texts can be generated fully automatically, such as routine reports of various types (e.g. Goldberg et al., 1994; Kukich et al., 1994) or explanations of expert system reasoning (cf. Moore, 1995 and references therein). While striving to design highly sophisticated, fully automatic systems has undoubtedly led to a deeper understanding of the text generation process, it has had the unfortunate effect (to date) of limiting the use of techniques pioneered in the NLG community to just a few niches where high knowledge acquisition costs stand a chance of being balanced by substantial volume of needed texts (cf. Reiter and Mellish, 1993). By joining the emerging authoring support crowd and endeavoring to create new opportunities in automated documentation, we hope to contribute to the broader acceptance and visibility of NLG technology in the overall computing community. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the software engineering goals for CogentHelp. In Section 3 we provide background on automated documentation and identify where CogentHelp fits in this picture. In Section 4 we give a brief overview of the CogentHelp system. In Section 5, we highlight the NLG techniques used in support of the software engineering goals identified in Section 2. In Section 6 we describe CogentHelp's authoring interface. Finally, in Section 7 we conclude by discussing the outlook for CogentHelp's use and further development. 2 S o f t w a r e E n g i n e e r i n g G o a l s From a software engineering perspective, we set out to achieve three main goals in designing CogentHelp, each of which has various aspects. The first of these goals is end user-oriented, whereas the latter two are developer-oriented. The first goal is to promote quality in the resulting help systems, which includes promoting • Consis tency the grouping of material into help pages, the use of formatting devices such as"""	crowdsourcing;documentation;economy of second life;embedded system;emoticon;expert system;fits;graphical user interface;knowledge acquisition;literate programming;microsoft outlook for mac;natural language generation;online and offline;prototype;software engineer;software engineering;user space;word lists by frequency	Michael White;David E.

e713ba0dbea9667d5a67be439800b4e7a56cc78f	multimedia information filtering		In the film Minority Report (20th Century Fox, 2002), which is set in the near future, there is a scene where a man walks into a department store and is confronted by a holographic shop assistant. The holographic shop assistant recognises the potential customer by iris-recognition technology. The holographic assistant then welcomes the man by his name and starts to inform him of offers and items that he would be interested in based on his past purchases and what other shoppers who have similar tastes have purchased. This example of future personalised shopping assistants that can help a customer find shopping goods is not too far away from becoming reality in some form or another. Malone, Grant, Turbak, Brobst, and Cohen (1987) introduced three paradigms for information selection, cognitive, economic, and social, based on their work with a system they called the Information Lens. Their definition of cognitive filtering, the approach actually implemented by the Information Lens, is equivalent to the “content filter” defined earlier by Denning, and this approach is now commonly referred to as “content-based” filtering. Their most important contribution was to introduce an alternative approach that they called social (now also more commonly called collaborative) filtering. In social filtering, the representation of a document is based on annotations to that document made by prior readers of the document. In the 1990s much work was done on collaborative filtering (CF). There were three systems that were considered to be the quintessential recommender systems. The Grouplens project (Miller, Albert, Lam, Konstan, & Riedl, 2003) initially was used for filtering items from the Usenet news domain. This later became the basis of Movielens. The Bellcore Video recommender system (Hill, Stead, Rosenstein, & Furnas, 1995), which recommended video films to users based on what they had rented before, and Ringo (Shardanand & Maes, 1995), which later was published on the Web and marketed as Firefly, used social filtering to recommend movies and music.

I can make this claim because for the past 20 years I have been walking around with digital eye glasses (DEG), and I believe my life has been enhanced as a result. Perhaps I am biased about wearable computing, but like my EyeTap invention (www.eyetap.org) that computa-tionally processes everything I see, I try to tell it like it is. I am of course, only a one person case study, but I know there are others out there who feel the same way as I do, and perhaps for very different reasons. It is well known that when traditional optical eyeglasses were first invented, many wearers of these eyeglasses were treated poorly and discriminated against. But as time went on, society began to accept eyeglasses, even to the point where they have, in some instances, become fashion statements. Many people, who have no need for spectacles , will purchase zero prescription eyeglasses just to look smart. This says a lot about technological innovation and how society responds to it over generations of varying levels of acceptance. Especially as we age, it is my prediction that many of us will choose DEG, which can correct for more than just focus (e.g., prescriptions can be adaptive and interactive). And the wearable computer becomes, in effect, like part of the brain itself: """" Eye is a camera """" and """" mind is a computer """" [2]. Over the past 34 years of living my life through wearable computing, I have found myself on the receiving end of some shocking behavior. I can only describe it as resistance to technology. My guess is that some people are frightened of the cameras that are necessary for the functioning of mediated, augmented , and augmediated reality. People are possibly frightened of being recorded, or just plainly frightened of how the video may be captured and used against them at a later date. In the vast majority of adverse situations I have found myself in, people belonging to large multinationals and government agencies have been the most heavy-handed with me about wear-able technologies.

Box office revenues are on the increase as more movie patrons flock to the theaters than in years past. So, what’s wrong? Movie budgets are sky rocketing with digital artists working around the clock to bring the directors vision to the big screen. The number of effects shots in feature films are increasing by the hundreds. The steady advancements in both computer hardware and software packages have allowed for some of this industry growth. The rest of the growth has come from artists shackled to their workstations for 10-l 8 hours a day, sometimes 6 to 7 days a week. This results in a burn out cycle that leaves artists tired, frustrated, and sometimes injured with repetitive stress injuries (RSI). The solution to the growing number of effects and massive budgets of feature films may not be heaping hundreds of artists on each film project, but in how the artist interacts with the computer.	computer animation;computer hardware;digital effects (studio);flock;hatred;repetitive strain;workstation;x86	Mark Swain	1998		10.1145/286498.286554	user interface design;10-foot user interface;simulation;shell;human–computer interaction;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;operating system;graphical user interface;multimedia;natural user interface;user interface	HCI	-55.615473784789714	-27.50735738787649	174125

"""" The theory is that Jobs saw gurus in India, focal points of love and respect, surrounded by devotees, and he similarly thought to himself, """" I want that job! """" This observation is not meant as a criticism, and certainly not as an insult. It simply provides an explanatory framework for what made Jobs a unique figure. For instance, he liberally used the guru's tactic of treating certain devotees badly from time to time as a way of making them more devoted. I heard members of the original Ma-cintosh team confess that they succumbed. They were tangibly stunned by it, repeatedly. They recognized it happening in real time, and yet they consented. Jobs would scold and humiliate people and somehow elicit an ever more intense determination to attempt to win his approval, or more precisely, his pleasure. The process is described in an essay by Alan Watts on how to be a guru that was well known around the time Apple was first taking off. The successful guru is neither universally nor arbitrarily scornful to followers, but there should be enough randomness to keep them guessing and off guard. When praise comes, it should be utterly piercing and luminous, so as to make the recipient feel as though they've never known love before that moment. Apple's relationship with its customers often followed a similar course. There would be a pandemic of bleating about a problem, such as a phone that lost calls when touched a certain way, and somehow the strife seemed to further cement customer devotion instead of driving them away. What other tech company has experienced such a thing? Jobs imported the marketing techniques of India's gurus to the business of computation. Another way in which Jobs emulated the practices of gurus is in the …"""	computation;el torito (cd-rom standard);emulator;fo (complexity);focal (programming language);job (computing);luminous studio;randomness;strife;watts humphrey	Jaron Lanier	2011	Commun.

Due to the development of information and communication technologies, it is difficult to handle the billions of connected machines. In this paper, to cope with the problem, we introduce machine social networks, where they freely follow each other and share common interests with their neighbors. We classify characteristics and describe required functionalities of socially connected machines. We also illustrate two examples; a twit-bot and maze scenario.	social network	Taehyoung Shim;Dong-Min Kim;Seong-Lyun Kim	2013		10.3182/20131111-3-KR-2043.00022	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	-59.72020304790602	-29.52610675955057	177904

If you don't believe that, compare a legal text with the memoirs of a trial lawyer, or a pilot training manual with an expose on the lives of test pilots. Even accounting for differences of expository style and ignoring titillating personal details, textbooks tell but a small part of the story. For most professional programmers the situation is probably even more extreme, when they consider the relevancy of a textbook on algorithm design to the task of building a software system. They can see how a programmer might sometimes use the basic data structures and search algorithms in the texts, but they have to wonder whether the more advanced methods ever really influence software engineering practice. The answer is """"yes,"""" for two reasons. The first is that soime impact comes from cultural immersion. In law, for example, few of the particular cases studied in law school will arise in the student's practice, but by studying all of them he will """"learn to think like a lawyer."""" I find a similar argument in the relevancy of algorithms to software: studying an algorithm teaches us to ignore irrelevant detail and to see straight into the heart of a computational problem. The second reason is more direct: algorithm design is relevant to software engineering because problems occasionally arise in software systems that can be effectively solved by the tools of the field. In this article, I tell how algorithm design was used in the development of one small (but critical) routine in a software system. I hope to communicate two things. The first is that algorithm design, properly applied, can be useful. The second task is more elusive. I hope to show what an algorithm designer does during an average working day.

Its benefits are undisputable - assistance in individual physical, intellectual and psychical development. However, it seems that like in the able-bodied environment also here one should consider more or less conscious social isolation resulting from fascination by virtual world. It is more likely since the isolation is still fuelled by a problem of architectonic and psychological barriers that still exist in the environment and are not experienced in the cyberspace. The subject of presented research is a comparative analysis of sport-oriented behaviours of disabled young people against the background of trends related to the rapid development of computer games. The first part of the study discusses problems of active recreation in the Polish society and video games development directions with particular focus on the needs and restrictions of people with disabilities. The application section presents the research work targeted on the one hand to define the role of virtual competition of disabled youth in their everyday life and on the other, to check how it may jeopardize the health-oriented sports competition in the real world.

c78171f9c2ad1f696037c91825903011a6fbe69e	disrupting the coming robot stampedes: designing resilient information ecologies		Machines are designed to communicate widely and efficiently. Humans, less so. We evolved social structures that function best as small subgroups interacting within larger populations [2] [15]. Technology changes this dynamic, by allowing all individuals to be connected at the speed of light. A dense, tightly connected population can behave like a single agent. In animals, this happens in constrained areas where stampedes can easily form. Machines do not need these kinds of conditions. The very techniques used to design best-of-breed solutions may increase the risk of dangerous mass behaviors among homogeneous machines. In this paper we argue that ecologically-based design principles such as the presence of diversity are a broadly effective strategy to defend against unintended consequences at scale. [12] 1 The bonfire of the vanity plates The Southern California summer of 2024 is once again a scorcher. The record temperatures are mitigated by the cool air conditioning of the autonomous vehicles packing the freeways. They move fluidly, as traffic jams are generally a thing of the past. Sophisticated routing algorithms keep traffic flowing smoothly around any problems. On their designated lanes vehicles travel in tight, aerodynamic packs at inhuman speeds. Commute times that used to take hours now take minutes. The process is so efficient and trusted that passengers rarely even glance up from their screens. A wildfire is rapidly descending on Los Angeles. Blown by gale-force winds, it covers 10 miles every 30 minutes, endangering the 405 near Bel-Air. Police shut down the highway, and the traffic quickly routes around the obstruction. Many of the alternate routes are also blocked, but the A* algorithm [8] is relentless in finding new routes. A solution is quickly found. Unfortunately, it is through burning neighborhoods not yet identified on the satellite map updates. Thousands of cars optimally converge on a two lane road, twisting along a ridge into the fire. Although these cars are state-of-the-art and handle many circumstances flawlessly, they have not been trained to recognize sheets of fire blowing across the roads, generating temperatures that melt metal. To their sensors, the way ahead is clear. Thousands of guidance systems agree that this is the best route. Thousands of cars charge into the flames. As they enter the fire, antennas burn off, sensors malfunction and vehicles disappear from the network. Like stampeding buffalo, they swerve off the road and into the ravine. This happens fast, with between 3-4 cars leaving the road per second [1]. ar X iv :1 81 0. 01 27 2v 2 [ cs .C Y ] 2 6 N ov 2 01 8	a* search algorithm;autonomous robot;buffalo airstation;converge;decibel;ecology;google summer of code;guidance system;humans;interaction;little big adventure;population;robertson–seymour theorem;routing;sensor;set packing;smoothing;social structure;unintended consequences	Philip Feldman;Aaron Dant;Wayne Lutters	2018	CoRR		data science;knowledge management;unintended consequences;design elements and principles;robot;technological change;social structure;homogeneous;population;computer science	Networks	-57.55551332990768	-26.042915176425407	184240

Based on that reasoning, the virtual humans respond in believable ways. Virtual humans can interact in natural language, understanding speech and responding with synthesized speech. In addition to verbal communication, virtual humans can use non-verbal communication means such as gestures. In addition to rational behavior, virtual humans also have the ability to model and mimic human emotions.At the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, we have been engaged in the construction of virtual humans for the past six years. This project is not only a significant AI research effort, but it is also a significant software engineering task because a number of research projects must be integrated and work together to realize the virtual human. In this talk I will outline the virtual human effort, describe some of the synergies that have emerged from the software integration effort, and report on the lessons we have learned in this large-scale integration effort.	artificial intelligence;humans;institute for creative technologies;integrated circuit;natural language understanding;population;simulation;software engineering;speech synthesis;synergy;system integration;virtual actor	William R.

While portable technology is familiar to us, and the head-mounted displays associated with virtu,al reality have been widely touted in the media, environmental technology h~ns been far less visible. AS its champion for well over two decades, I will focus on 1""""he environmental approach. In the late 1960s it was apparent that the declining cost of processing implied the computing world dominated by programmers would yield to onE, in which users operated applications, and then to another in which people parl:icipated in computer-generated experiences. It was this final step that I was interested in-the integration Of computing with the lives and minds Of everyday People. In 1969 I reasoned that the ultimate computer interface would be to the human body and its senses. This interface would perceive the user' rather than receive input; from him. I corlsidered Ivan Sutherland's head-mounted display and rejected it, because I beUeved people would resist any technology that was physically uncomfortable. Instead, I resolved to create a """"come as Vou are"""" interface I thought would be more acceptable. To this end, I operated within a framework called a computer-cont,'oiled responsive enw~ronment, a space within which everything you saw or heard was in response to what you did [2]. Rather than sitting down and moving only your fingers, you interacted with your body. In one demonstration, a simple 3D scene was displayed on a projection screen. Its perspective (:hanged appropriately as the 1,000 pressure sensors in the floor reported the participant's movements around the room. In other ir~teractions, footsteps triggered musical 1:ones. In yet another experience, walking around the room controlled the movements Of a graphic symbol in a graphic maze that was video projected on the wall-sized screen. If thE! participant tried to cheat, the maze changed itself in a variety of amusing ways designed to tllwart progress. These experiences werE, = intended as metaphors for a world in which computing networks would """"permeate our lives as much as electricity does today.""""

From an electronic and mental viewpoint this means that the Internet becomes an extension of the human nervous system (and vice versa). Such a connection on a regular or mass basis will have far reaching effects for society. In this article the authors discuss their own practical implant self-experimentation, especially insofar as it relates to extending the human nervous system. Trials involving an intercontinental link up are described. As well as technical aspects of the work, social, moral and ethical issues, as perceived by the authors, are weighed against potential technical gains. The authors also look at technical limitations inherent in the co-evolution of Internet implanted individuals as well as the future distribution of intelligence between human and machine.	experiment;internet	Kevin Warwick;Mark Gasson	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

Our sense of identity is largely shaped by events we have experienced. Our understanding of history is a narrative of events in the past. The humanities and social sciences are concerned with the human experience, with actions and interactions. The sciences also deal with events: changes, processes, and experiments. Events may be described factually and themselves be regarded as facts. Facts, in turn, assume their full meaning only in relation to narratives, which provide the contextual frameworks for understanding them.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#In our daily lives we have little difficulty thinking and talking about events, facts, and narratives. However, information systems operate on objects (bits, data, documents). Events, facts, and narratives are not objects and difficulties arise when we try to analyze formally what they are.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Three related papers address these issues. First, a direct examination of the nature of events; second, an account of two contrasting ways of contextualizing facts; and, third., an attempt to encode events in biographical narratives.	information science	Michael K.

If you let the animal roam freely near this place (say, if its path is the black line in Fig. 1), then this cell will fire at the red dots. These neurons are called place cells, and they seem to be part of the mental map animals need to get around in the world: they navigate a familiar terrain by going from one place cell to the next.

It had been some time since either of us had seriously reviewed the research literature on these topics, so we decided to ask the CHI community for advice on the best place to get up to speed. The replies we got were nearly unanimous: If we wanted an overview of the state of the art in these areas, 3D User Interfaces: The authors provide us with a comprehensive summary of the extant literature, organized in a way that serves well as an authoritative reference tool. Each chapter carefully defines its own scope, provides a detailed breakdown of the topics covered, summarizes the key points, and provides suggestions for additional reading. If your goal was to sit and read the book from cover to cover, you might find the extensive organization to be a bit much, but if you're like us and pick up the book a bit here and a bit there, checking back on it to review timely topics, you'll appreciate the organization. The first part of the book is just the sort of introduction you'll want if you're new to 3D user interfaces (3D UIs). What's so hard about going from 2D to 3D? With many examples, the authors explain how 2D metaphors we've gotten used to over the last 25 years often don't work in 3D. Dragging an object with a mouse works fine in 2D, but dragging an object in 3D requires more degrees of freedom than mouse movement provides. Some of the foundations of 2D UI design will carry over, but new foundations must be laid too. In two quick chapters, you'll get up to speed on the need for and applications of 3D UIs, some basic terminology, the history of the field, and the varied disciplines that are contributing to 3D UI design. Part two of the book is all about hardware. From the banal (mice and CRTs) to the bizarre (paint cups and a bucket?), the authors rigorously catalog the kinds of hardware used to interact with 3D systems. Beyond a mere catalog of input and output devices, though, there are nice discussions of the pros, cons, and key considerations of using each device type.

Here, different perspectives on artificial intelligent agents, primarily in the shape of robots, but also including other kinds of intelligent systems, are explored. Hence, IT-ethical issues related to humans interactions with social robots and artificial intelligent agents are illustrated with reference to: Alex Proyas’ I, Robot; James Cameron’s Terminator; and the Wachowski brothers’ Matrix. All three movies present robots cast in the roles of moral agents capable of doing good or evil. Steven Spielberg’s Artificial Intelligence, A.I. gives rise to a discussion of the robot seen as a moral patient and furthermore reflects on possibilities for care and trust relations between robots and humans. Andrew Stanton’s Wall-E shapes a discussion of robots as altruistic machines in the role as facilitators of a flourishing society. Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report allows for a discussion of knowledgediscovering technology and the possibility for balancing data utility and data privacy. Design/methodology/approach – Observations of themes in sci-fi movies within the life span of the ETHICOMP conference series are discussed with the purpose of illustrating ways in which science fiction reflects (science) faction. In that sense, science fiction does not express our worries for a distant future, but rather casts light over questions, which is of concern in the present time. Findings – Human technology interactions are addressed and it is shown how sci-fi films highlight philosophical questions that puzzle us today, such as which kind of relationships can and ought to be formed with robots, and whether the roles they play as social actors demand that one ought to assign moral standing to them. The paper does not present firm answers but instead pays attention to the selection and framing of questions that deserve attention. Originality/value – To relate sci-fi movies to topics raised during the past 20 years of the ETHICOMP conference series, seemed to be an appropriate way of celebrating the 20-year anniversary of the ETHICOMP conference series.	artificial intelligence;framing (world wide web);humans;i, robot;information privacy;intelligent agent;interaction;social robot;terminator (character concept);timeline;type conversion;wall-e	Anne Gerdes	2015	J.

And thus our rant: deceiving with numbers. At university you may have had the pleasure of a reading assignment instructing you to read and memorize a slim volume called How to Lie with Statistics [1]. This is a classic that presents the unimaginable— convincing people of something by manipulating unfamiliar concepts that sound scientific, and thus authoritative. One could, of course, achieve the same end via bullying or mesmerizing charisma. But lying with statistics is a venerable process engaged in by politicians, advertisers, and scientists— and even usability professionals. One of the ingenious cheats of statistics is to """" prove """" that you are correct by accentuating the positive and eliminating the negative. To be a master of deception you do, of course, need tools. Not of the rabbit-and-the-magic-hat variety. A simple high-fidelity prototype can do the trick. We can call this type of deceiving with numbers High Fidelity Deception, and it goes something like this: • Reduce the overall feature set of a target product. • Design a prototype that covers some of the features. • Ensure that it is attractive enough to resemble a finished product with a dose of glamour: nice anima-tions, transitions, professional color palette (for extra points, make it blue—you do know about that, right?), refined font, and upscale branding elements. • Show it to a few high-placed individuals who (this part is important) don't have the time or inclination to dive into the details. • Get their enthusiastic endorsement. • Proceed to formalize this into a final product regardless of the paucity of credible detail. You will get excellent marks: high levels of user satisfaction, compliments on the prototype's refined sensibilities , and unequivocal approval to proceed. This prototype is, in fact, merely an attractive shell, but it passes muster, and you can quantify its success by repeating what percentage of users who have seen it were """" wowed """" by it (don't mention the actual number of users, though—after all, two out of two gives you 100 percent!). Why does this happen? A designer can impress stakeholders by producing an impressive-looking arti-fact. If it is, in fact, your product, but it isn't finished yet, you can call it a demo and all will be forgiven if your scripted click-through falls off track and your prototype crashes badly.

The engine of the technologies keeps changing while the driver is sometimes a discipline, learners, or the teacher. The landscape passed along the way includes fleeting glimpses of beautiful but unconquerable mountains followed by attractive rivers with treacherous currents. The population is sometimes persuaded by innovators to come along for the ride, and then suddenly they embark on their own journey into an entirely different valley. The paper analyses this journey along the TC3 twin track of education with and about information and communication technologies, using evidence from its publications and debates, organisational structure and the influence of individuals. The presentation, from one who is neither a computer scientist nor mathematician, will aim to portray a particular perspective on this roller-coaster relationship.	computer scientist;nights: journey of dreams	Deryn Watson	2006		10.1007/978-0-387-34741-7_1	humanities;art;performance art	HCI	-58.46725616825731	-25.252858848690856	193263

In addition to this cultural expression, numerous musicians and other disciplines form groups with diverse and widespread artistic expressions. A group of small halls located in narrow terrain lots is concentrated within the Palermo neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, designed to accommodate these artistic groups. However, there was no model hall that can hold simultaneous events, such as drama, music and dance, in the same building. Such hall should avoid acoustical interference between the events, and should fulfill the noise regulations of the City. The architectural design of the Border Cultural Centre, which begins from spaces shaped by natural light, with large openings to the outside, was a challenge for the acoustic consultants since the above acoustic requirements should be also fulfilled.

Addressing several issues that explore the human side of social robots, this book investigateswhat a social robot is and how we might come to think about social robots in the different areas of everyday life. Organized around three sections that deal with Perceptions and Attitudes to Social Robots, Human Interaction with Social Robots, and Social Robots in Everyday Life, it explores the idea that even if the challenges of robot technologies can be overcome from a technological perspective, the question remains as to what kind of machine we want to have and use in our daily lives. Lessons learned from previous widely adopted technologies, such as smartphones, indicate that robot technologies could potentially be absorbed into the everyday lives of humans in such a way that it is the human that determines the human-machine interaction. In a similar way to how todays information and communication technologies were initially designed for professional/industrial use, but were soon commercialized for the mass market and then personalized by humans in the course of daily practice, the use of social robots is now facing the same revolution of domestication. In the context of this transformation, which involves the profound embedding of robots in everyday life, the human aspect of social robots will play a major part. This book sheds new light on this highly topical issue, one of the central subjects that will be taught and studied at universities worldwide and that will be discussed widely, publicly and repeatedly in the near future.	social robot	Sonia Brondi	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.002	media studies	Robotics	-59.898158865440614	-29.41406861648956	194794

At that time, he was referring to interruptions caused by humans, for example through instant messages, emails, or cell-phone rings. In recent years, with technology entering every corner of our lives, we've become deluged with interruptions: from noti cations on PCs, TVs, and laptops; to push messages on smartphones, tablets, and wear-ables such as smartwatches and tness trackers; to ads on public displays. The frequency of interruptions will only increase as displays become even more ubiquitous. In , people living in cities were already seeing an estimated , ads per day. By , totaling the projected number of digital signs, wearables, desktop computers, and mobile devices , there could be as many as. billion displays. This corresponds to an average of eight displays per person, a percent increase from. And this estimate doesn't even include other types of displays such as those in cars and household appliances. In daily life we constantly shift our attention among various tasks, filtering relevant from irrelevant information as well as processing and acting upon new information. Interruptions by displays further reduce our attention span—that is, the amount of concentrated time we can spend on any single task without getting distracted by other tasks. Consequently, sustained attention is increasingly being replaced by continuous partial attention: the act of paying simultaneous attention to multiple sources of information but only at a superficial level. In economics, this well-known phenomenon has led to the """" attention economy """" theory that acknowledges both the scarcity and superficiality of consumer attention and, consequently, the importance of managing it. Continuous partial attention fundamentally limits us-ers' ability to e ciently interact with computing systems, as well as these systems' ability to support their users, yet As the number of displays we interact with rapidly increases, managing user attention has emerged as a critical challenge for next-generation human−computer interfaces."""	attentive user interface;desktop computer;email;instant messaging;interruption science;laptop;mobile device;mobile phone;pervasive informatics;relevance;smartphone;smartwatch;tablet computer;the superficial;wearable computer	Andreas Bulling	2016	IEEE Computer	10.1109/MC.2016.32	user interface design;context-aware pervasive systems;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;post-wimp;natural user interface;user interface;ubiquitous computing	HCI	-59.25130058907363	-27.685334452723524	195764

It may be a broken bone or a major illness. And if you live long enough, you will experience age-related impairments such as limitations of sight, hearing, dexterity, and mobility. Those who are born with severe medical conditions, however, have to accept their disabilities and live with them every day. In Design Meets Disability, Graham Pullin looks at design for disability through the principles that drive design in the able world. By doing so, Pullin helped me realize that most of us who work on accessibility have been thinking about this all wrong. So much of design for disability has been about basic engineering and problem solving, making it possible to overcome certain limitations. For example, the creation of accessible voting systems was a watershed moment for people with varied disabilities. Since about 2004 disabled persons who are able to access a polling place can independently cast their vote. This is no small thing. I’ve witnessed people with disabilities shed tears of joy and relief as they recount their experiences of voting independently for the first time. However, voting is still extremely difficult if you have disabilities. Most existing voting systems were retrofitted rather than designed for accessibility. There’s nothing elegant about them. They’re slow. They’re awkward. They’re different from the voting systems that non-disabled voters use. If you don’t have a disability, it is easy to look at designing for limitations as accommodating exceptions. But for people who have impairments, limitations, or disabilities, working around them or through them is a way of life. Pullin, a medical engineer by training, works on projects to embed assistance in everyday objects, such as a “speaking chair” to help people who can’t verbally communicate.

In this paper, we present an empirical study of SAM, an analogy-based story generation (ASG) algorithm, that was created as part of our Riu interactive narrative system. Specifically, our study focuses on SAM’s capability to retrieve and generate short non-interactive stories. Combining qualitative and quantitative methods from different disciplines, the methodology in this study can be extended to evaluating other computational narrative systems.	asg software solutions;algorithm;align (company);computation;continuation;interactivity;lazy evaluation;usability testing	Jichen Zhu;Santiago Ontañón	2013			simulation;computer science;multimedia	NLP	-57.55658866317026	-30.388847525902676	197060

The author looks at how good testing techniques can make projects run better and faster, and produce an improved result. The primary point is that there's no incompatibility between usability testing and a rational product process. We can think of usability testing as simply another aspect of quality assurance, and can fold it into the product process in much the same way as software quality assurance (QA). By having usability people involved from the beginning, big problems get found earlier, and small problems get found in time. The fear of losing control of a project to a usability person who finds a last-minute interface design problem is therefore a red herring. You can indeed find usability problems that might affect project completion late in the development process, just like you can find system architecture problems. But the way to keep this from happening is to test your system and your ideas during each stage of development, gathering the kind of information you need at each of those stages. That's why usability testing is a journey, not a destination	foldit;software incompatibility;software quality assurance;systems architecture;usability testing	Jim Miller	2006	IEEE Internet Computing	10.1109/MIC.2006.138	user interface design;usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;think aloud protocol;web usability;quality assurance;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;rite method;interface design;scheduling;software testing;user interface;heuristic evaluation;world wide web;software development process;software quality	SE	-61.82003566286446	-27.983768805640857	197500

16a7601934b0f813878e90dbe65caa8fa58e774e	the tyranny of the clock	clock-free paradigm	In no characteristic is existing society in theWest so sharply distinguished from the earlier societies, whether of Europe or the East, than in its conception of time. To the ancient Chinese or Greek, to the Arab herdsman or Mexican peon of today, time is represented in the cyclic processes of nature, the alternation of day and night, the passage from season to season. The nomads and farmers measured and still measure their day from sunrise to sunset, and their year in terms of the seedtime and harvest, of the falling leaf and the ice thawing on the lakes and rivers. The farmer worked according to the elements, the craftsman for so long as he felt it necessary to perfect his product. Time was seen in a process of natural change, and men were not concerned in its exact measurement. For this reason civilisations highly developed in other respects had the most primitive means of measuring time, the hour glass with it’s trickling sand or drippingwater, the sundial, useless on a dull day, and the candle or lamp whose unburnt remnant of oil or wax indicated the hours. All these devices where approximate and inexact, and were often rendered unreliable by the weather or the personal laziness of the tender. Nowhere in the ancient or medieval world were more than a tiny minority of men concerned with time in the terms of mathematical exactitude. Modern, Western man, however lives in a world which runs according to the mechanical and mathematical symbols of clock time. The clock dictates his movements and inhibits his actions. The clock turns time from a process of nature into a commodity that can be measured and bought and sold like soap or sultanas. And because, without some means of exact time keeping, industrial capitalism could never have developed and could not continue to exploit the workers, the clock represents an element of mechanical tyranny in the lives of modern men more potent than any individual exploiter or any other machine. It is valuable to trace the historical process by which the clock influenced the social development of modern European civilisation. It is a frequent circumstance of history that a culture or civilisation develops the device which will later be used for its destruction. The ancient Chinese, for example, invented gunpowder, which was developed by the military experts of the West and eventually led to the Chinese civilisation itself being destroyed by the high explosives of modern warfare. Similarly, the supreme achievement of the ingenuity of the craftsmen in the medieval cities of Europe was the invention of the mechanical clock, which, with it’s revolutionary alteration of the concept of time, materially assisted the growth of exploiting capitalism and the destruction of medieval culture. There is a tradition that the clock appeared in the eleventh century, as a device for ringing bells at regular intervals in the monasteries which, with the regimented life they imposed on their inmates, were the closest social approximation in themiddle ages to the factory of today.The first authenticated	fits;programming paradigm;turing	Ivan E.

Atayal is a tribe of Taiwanese aborigines whose culture is disappearing rapidly due to a hundred years of colonization. The weaving box, a cultural object, unique to the Atayal loom, is the subject of this study. Based on the previous studies, this study proposes a cultural ergonomic research model to provide designers with a valuable reference for designing a successful cross-cultural product as well as the interwoven experience of design and culture in the design process. This study attempts to illustrate how by enhancing the original meaning and images of Taiwan aboriginal culture features they may be transformed into modern products by taking advantage of new production technology and so fulfill the needs of the contemporary consumer market.	human factors and ergonomics;loom	Yuma Taru;John Kreifeldt;Ming-Xean Sun;Rungtai Lin	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40093-8_38	loom;aesthetics;taiwanese aborigines;human factors and ergonomics;weaving;tribe;sociology;original meaning	Theory	-59.296688453424515	-30.811389676349254	198346
c97184f1cb5c1f8936ee0dc264c55a4fb3dbd67c	towards new approach to enhance learning based on internet of things and virtual reality		The Internet of Things (IoT) and Virtual Reality (VR) are two of the most significant technologies of the last decades that will surely influence many technologies in the few coming years. According to the experts at Gartner, 20.8 billion new things will be connected by 2020 and researchers at kzero expect that only by 2018, there will be more than 170 million VR active user over the world. The IoT refers to the network of internet connected objects that are able to collect, exchange data and make decisions, while VR intends to provide a computer-generated 3D environment that can be used to build real-time tools that can monitor every response made by the user in a natural way. VR has the ability to change the world in some incredible ways, while the IoT already has did. Therefore, much promise and opportunities lay in these two technologies. Taken individually, IoT and VR find their applications in almost every field. In this paper we focus on the educational field, thus the confluence of IoT and VR technologies can bring more new opportunities and possibilities for the improvement and the effectiveness of both learning/training process and educational institution's infrastructure. In this sense, we propose a new approach that can allow learners to consolidate their conceptual learning with tangible experiences in a novel manner.	computer-generated holography;confluence;experience;internet of things;prototype;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation;virtual reality	Fahim Mohamed;Jakimi Abdeslam;El Bermi Lahcen	2018		10.1145/3230905.3230955	multimedia;educational institution;the internet;virtual reality;concept learning;internet of things;computer science	Visualization	-59.686823337865626	-29.48291452367268	198664
bfd881bde08cf8295e7ee9f9727d8e1dd156b4fd	human computation and crowdsourcing	human computation	"""I n 1937, Alan Turing formalized the notion of computation by introducing the Turing machine, thus laying the theoretical foundations of modern computer science. Turing also introduced a stronger computational model: a Turing machine with an oracle. In addition to performing computations itself, such a machine is able to ask the oracle questions and immediately receive correct answers, even if these questions are too hard for the machine itself to compute. Depending on the oracle's capabilities, a Turing machine with an oracle therefore could be much stronger than the machine on its own. The oracle itself is an unspecified entity, """" apart from saying that it cannot be a machine """" (from Turing's 1939 work, Undecidable). The concept of a Turing machine with an oracle is purely mathematical, yet it springs to mind when observing how today's computers use human capabilities in order to solve problems. Computers are now able to complete tasks that involve challenges far beyond what algorithms and artificial intelligence can achieve today— recognizing anomalies in photos, solving a Captcha puzzle, or judging artistic value—by outsourcing these challenges to humans. Millions of people being on the internet is what makes this outsourcing possible on a large scale. It's known as crowdsourcing. Understanding these reversed forms of human-computer symbiosis, in which the computer asks a person to compute something instead of vice versa, is the main object of research in the rising field of human computation. SymbIoSIS While we say that computers are using human capabilities, of course it's really humans who are using computers in order to utilize other humans' capabilities. Indeed, in many applications the role of computers is simply to coordinate between humans as they interact among themselves. This aspect of human computation can be described as a novel form of social organization, in which computers are mediators. The most prominent example is Wikipedia, where computers serve as the platform for aggregation of knowledge and efforts by many people, making it possible to produce a vast, comprehensive, and coherent encyclopedia equivalent to a printed book of around 1,000 volumes, all in a completely distributed manner! The articles in this issue of XRDS provide striking answers to major questions in the field of human computation and crowdsourcing. At the same time, they generate even more questions, highlighting future research directions and opportunities to get involved in the field.

f9a00431d58809cf1a66bdeb6690cc37cda10215	electric ip	electric ip	i n t e r a c t i o n s . . . j a n u a r y + f e b r u a r y 2 0 0 2 I was reading an article recently in a European newspaper about experiments by some European electricity providers (Power Utilities) to provide broadband internet connections over the powerlines to your house. The article discussed companies’ existing advantage—wires extending into everyone’s homes—and what this might mean for existing telecom providers, whether they are wired, cable or wireless. What the article missed was what it would mean for the user. It won’t just be another competitor forcing down prices and commoditising internet packets. It would mean a single network in your home. You could plug your computer into the mains supply, as you mostly have to do anyway, and you would be immediately connected to the internet. But there’s more: You could plug your TV into the mains and it would immediately be connected to the internet. And if the dream becomes a reality, and that connection is really broadband, you wouldn’t need the cable anymore. You could plug your TV into any outlet anywhere in the house. If you already have broadband to your home, and have experimented with the currently available broadband stations on the net, you will know that it’s already quite good; and with the equivalent of Moore’s Law for network bandwidth doing its work (it doubles yearly), it will only get better. And it doesn’t have to be just TVs. Radios, stereos, telephones, your alarm clock, your electric oven, will all be able to use the internet if it will improve functionality or the user experience. Alarm clock: wake me three hours before my flight will actually leave, four if the roads are bad. But there’s more, which will work even if it doesn’t reach broadband speeds (which it surely will). You may have noticed how over the last two decades ethernet interfaces have plummetted in price. It is not unusual anymore for one to be built into the machine. Just as modems have continued to drop in price (I recently bought a device that has a 2400 baud modem in it, for the equivalent of about $7), so will broadband interfaces continue to drop in price. When they drop to a couple of dollars, a light switch won’t have to be physically connected to the light it controls anymore, but will just send a message to the local network, to be responded to as necessary—probably by sending a message to one or more lights to switch themselves on. © Technology Abstracts/EyeWire, Inc.
