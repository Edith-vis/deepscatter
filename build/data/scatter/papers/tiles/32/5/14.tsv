001d90ffdee5433ddd3a3e2b2199d660ead38b82	regional telecommunication incident coordination: sharing information for rapid response	trust;regional coordination;interorganizational information sharing;telecommunications	Governments around the world are increasingly turning to information sharing as a lead strategy for developing response capacity for problems in a wide range of program and policy areas. One form of information sharing is regional coordination, which links together organizations or groups within close proximity to one another to pursue similar interests, goals, or mandates. Regional coordination requires leveraging currently held resources in innovative and potentially more efficient ways, as well as the establishment of new business processes, communication flows, and a system of governance that satisfies the needs of all stakeholders. In addition, trust, collaboration, and timely cross-boundary information sharing all play a pivotal role in this new model. This paper presents the experiences of the New York State Department of Public Service as it explores the concept of regional telecommunications incident response in New York; although this case study presents only one example of regional coordination, it raises issues which may apply in other regional information-sharing initiatives.

Based on a field study this article introduces the concept of stigmergy to the analysis of coordinative practices in the building process. It distinguishes between practices of stigmergy, articulation work and awareness practices. Stigmergy is understood as coordination achieved by acting directly on the evidence of work previously accomplished by others. The article provides descriptions of stigmergy in the building process i.e. in design as well as construction work. It seeks to (1) introduce the concept of stigmergy to CSCW, (2) to delimit this concept in regard to other concepts of coordination such as articulation work and awareness and (3) to provide descriptions of practices of stigmergy in the building process and, in this capacity, to help explain how complex large-scale cooperative work is coordinated.	awareness;biconnected component;computer-supported cooperative work;delimiter;field research;interconnectedness;schmidt decomposition;stigmergy;trinity	Lars Rune Christensen	2012	Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)	10.1007/s10606-012-9181-3	simulation;awareness;knowledge management;communication	HCI	-82.7582648628916	-4.649295667858522	162033

This paper, comparatively assesses the current state of affairs in broadband and digital public services in selected South East Europe countries in order to identify weaknesses and highlight strengths and to produce knowledge resources and provide insights that will support informed decision making including strategy and policy planning. It builds on three surveys that took place in the second quarter of 2013 and evidence gathered from seven South East Europe countries.	accessibility;bridging (networking)	Konstantinos Antonis;Christos Bouras;Fabrizio D'Elia;Annalisa Di Vincenzo;Georgios Diles;Vasileios Kokkinos;Andreas Koskeris	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912564	telecommunications;national broadband plan;computer security	Mobile	-79.33538041515598	-8.170886471901373	162170
5970d801113501efb3adcfb45a9e8745c40c31e6	accelerating health service and data capturing trough community health workers in rural ethiopia - a pre-requisite to progress		Community based health service is escalating in many developing countries as a means to fulfill health related millennium development goals. Community health workers provide primary health care, and collect and compile health data in collaboration with different actors. This collaboration requires knowledge communication. An interpretative case study was conducted in Ethiopia to understand the knowledge communication across boundaries. Using transfer, translation and transformation framework of Carlile, this study discuss how knowledge related to the health extension packages is communicated across syntactic, semantic and pragmatic boundaries among health extension workers, their teachers, supervisors, community volunteers and rural households. The study also describes the knowledge brokering role of health extension workers and voluntary community health workers. They interact and negotiate with rural households to facilitate communication of novel knowledge concerning the health extension packages. The study identified impediments that preclude knowledge communication. In order to improve knowledge communication across boundaries and enhance the implementation of health extension packages, it is essential; to formulate apt target for health services, equip health extension workers training schools with essential resources, offer trainings to community volunteers and make available standardized register and report formats at health posts for proper recording and reporting.	automatic identification and data capture;compiler;health insurance portability and accountability act	Zufan Abera Damtew	2012			community health;knowledge management;environmental health;computer science;trough (meteorology)	HCI	-81.29026245155038	-6.224624548983799	162213
18d49e707559a57cef27a87b21abd7796d4dd767	interface design issues for mobile commerce	mobile commerce;interface design	Effective interface design for mobile handheld devices facilitates user adoption of mobile commerce (m-commerce). Current wireless technology poses many constraints for effective interface design. These constraints include limited connectivity and bandwidth, diverse yet simplistic devices, the dominance of proprietary tools and languages, and the absence of common standards for application development. The convergence of mobile Internet and wireless communications has not yet resulted in major growth in mobile commerce. Consumer adoption of m-commerce has been slow even in countries such as Finland, which have broadly adopted wireless technology (Anckar & D’Incau, 2002). An international study of mobile handheld devices and services suggests that mobile commerce is at a crossroads (Jarvenpaa, Lang, Takeda & Tuunainen, 2003). The enterprise and business use of wireless technology holds greater promise, but it demands the transformation of business processes and infrastructure. Poor usability of mobile Internet sites and wireless applications for commerce activities stands out as a major obstacle for the adoption of mobile solutions. For example, even with the latest 3G phones in Japan, consumers still find the small screen display and small buttons on these devices difficult to use (Belson, 2002).	bandwidth (signal processing);business process;internet;mobile commerce;mobile device;television;usability;user interface design	Susy S.

fcd9910bd797c69d7719fc64e2e0f580cd784d95	four reference models for transparency requirements in information systems		Transparency is a key emerging requirement in modern businesses and their information systems. Transparency refers to the information which flows amongst stakeholders for the purpose of informed decision-making and taking the right action. Transparency is generally associated with positive connotations such as trust and accountability. However, it has been shown that it could have adverse effects such as information overload and affecting decisions objectiveness. This calls for systematic approaches for transparency to ensure its cost-effectiveness and avoid such adverse side effects. This is especially true considering that the relatively few works in the literature on transparency requirements have focused mainly on making information available and accessible and have paid little focus on the information receivers’ side and making it meaningful for them. In this paper, we reflect on our previous research on transparency and its multi-faceted constructs and review multi-disciplinary conceptualisation and propose four reference models which are meant to form a holistic conceptual baseline for transparency requirements in information systems. These reference models cover transparency actors, transparency meaningfulness, transparency usefulness, and information quality in transparency. We also discuss the interdependencies amongst these four reference models and their implications for requirements engineers and information system analysts. As a proof of concept, we analyse a mainstream transparency document, the United Kingdom Freedom of Information Act, in the light of our reference models and demonstrate the need to consider transparency more holistically and the need to include the information receiver’s perspective and the inter-relations amongst various properties and constituents of transparency as well. We then highlight areas of improvement informed by our analysis.	agent-based model;baseline (configuration management);faceted classification;freedom of information act 1982;freedom of information laws by country;holism;information overload;information quality;information system;interdependence;requirement	Mahmood Hosseini;Alimohammad Shahri;Keith Phalp;Raian Ali	2017	Requirements Engineering	10.1007/s00766-017-0265-y	accountability;management science;proof of concept;freedom of information;information quality;interdependence;reference model;computer science;information system;transparency (graphic);knowledge management	Security	-79.6311900057801	-5.270041368351428	163450
07952200bcf8d79b387cd56b7606dbe8e7884473	e-voting in brazil - the risks to democracy	technological innovation;political system;technology strategy;electronic voting	Literature has shown that countries with strong democratic traditions, such as the United States and Canada, are not yet using electronic voting systems intensively, due to the concern for and emphasis on security. It has revealed that there is no such thing as an error-free computer system, let alone an electronic voting system, and that existing technology does not offer the conditions necessary for a reliable, accurate and secure electronic voting system. In this context, then, what are the risks of e-voting to democracy? In what ways, if at all, can more fragile, less mature democracies be buttressed with e-voting systems? As a key component of e-democracy, it seems that e-voting technologies are to become more secure and increasingly reliable in the near future and will indeed be adopted in many countries. In what ways, if at all, will the introduction of such systems increase voter confidence in the political system, promote citizen engagement in political life, and nurture the evolution of democracy? If both e-voting and edemocracy are emerging based on popular demand that is, as a demand-driven alternative to current processes, then there is no doubt that they are likely to enhance and improve the efficiency of traditional democracy. However, if e-voting technology is being introduced based on a supply-driven fashion the technology exists therefore it should and must be implemented then the implications for democracy should be considered. Brazil’s introduction of e-voting offers a cautionary tale of supply-driven technological implication. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the introduction of e-voting in Brazil is highly risky to democracy due to the lack of emphasis on security and the lack of a sociallyinformed and socially driven approach to technological innovation. The Brazilian example illustrates the democratic implications of a market-driven approach. The lack of a technology strategy designed to promote and extend democratic principles is not surprising given the closed door, market-based negotiations that led to the adoption of e-voting in Brazil. The promise, and indeed, the imperative of a democratic, voter-centered approach as an alternative for the development of an electronic voting system, is explored in the paper.	commitment ordering;computer;imperative programming;user-centered design	José Rodrigues-Filho;Cynthia Alexander;Luciano Batista	2006			public economics;political science;economy	Security	-78.27983361042196	-8.965796831834203	163724

To do this I first review the processes of map-making that have been shaped by continual cartographic encounters, exchanges, and translations between American Indians and Euro-Americans. Dichotomies between Indigenous–traditional and Western–scientific are prevalent within the literature, but the boundaries between geographic knowledge systems have always been fuzzy and crossable. This review includes some processes strongly shaped by Indigenous communities, such as ethnocartography and counter-mapping in Alaska and Canada, and GIS processes controlled more by government institutions in the lower 48 US states. Second, I introduce the tenets of a new model – indigital geographic information networks (iGIN) – to describe the heterogeneous processes of encounters, exchanges, and translations merging Indigenous, scientific, and digital technologies into inclusive forms of technoscience. Third, I demonstrate iGIN processes through exploratory research at the university level, using Kiowa-language narratives and network GIS to create a new ‘‘third’’ construct. Finally, following brief concluding remarks, I propose future research directions.	cartography;counter-mapping;geographic information system;geomatics;knowledge-based systems;stochastic process	Mark Palmer	2012	Cartographica	10.3138/carto.47.2.80	geomatics;geography;sociology;cartography;remote sensing	OS	-77.46437887454923	-6.417168520878484	164589
ce86ee966c3c5a5ed676ae486e440fa45ebdfaf0	will vehicles go the mobile way? - merits and challenges arising by car-apps		Currently people are used to share and to get information wherever they are. This new information requirements is for now not sufficiently satisfied when it comes to the mobility and especially car sector due to the currently developments of social media and smartphone applications. Here, due to questions of safety and security, in-car systems are still closed, despite the fact that C2X applications are developed, but not yet on the market. Here challenges for current key players arise because these information gaps could be closed by not authorised parties developing information applications. How and by which extend such “car-apps” might lead to new markets and consumer habits is discussed in this paper.	android;authorization;mobile app;mobile phone;parallels desktop for mac;requirement;smartphone;social media	Franziska Wolf	2013		10.5220/0004571704250428	transport engineering;management science	HCI	-81.5070626955131	-9.313353661175915	164618

However, this process is slow in the public safety sector due to its requirements for tailored solutions regarding robustness, accessibility, safety and security. Even if there are specially designed solutions on the market the roll out and the use of them is seldom, or heavily delayed. This paper shows that many of the barriers in the launching process are influenced by disseminations on the web and that not enough attention is paid to the changing role of the public. The paper enumerates key challenges following the communication during the introduction of RAKEL, a TETRA type infrastructure in Sweden.		Ilona Heldal	2011	I. J.

They start from different starting point, and up to today, the perception of smart city is very wide. There are so many definition about Smart City. So, it's not easy to have the same perception about the status of the city if the city already reach the Smart City or no. Finally, any initiatives should have strong impact for people. In other side, there is ISO 37120:2014 standard (Sustainable Development of Communities -- Indicators for city services and quality of life). ISO 37120:2014 is applicable to any city, municipality or local government that undertakes to measure its performance in a comparable and verifiable manner, irrespective of size and location. This ISO standard don't care if the city is Smart City or no. This research propose the step by step process, how to identify the ICT related initiatives for each ISO 37120 indicators. The result is the list of initiatives that may be applicable for city manager to move the city to next better level.	don't-care term;formal verification;smart city	Arry Akhmad Arman;Antragama Ewa Abbas;Ratih Hurriyati	2015		10.1145/2846012.2846025	environmental protection;engineering;advertising;economic growth	HCI	-79.314408887459	-7.977769347332492	164966

In the context of this study, IT helps connect matchmaking service providers with those looking for love, particularly when a male seeks to meet and possibly marry a female from another country: a process which results in over 16,500 such ‘mail-order-bride’ (MOB) marriages a year in the United States alone. Past research in business disciplines has been largely silent about the way in which this process unfolds, the perspectives of the participants at different points of time, and the role of IT underlying the MOB matchmaking service. Adopting an interpretivist stance, and utilizing some of the methodological guidelines associated with the Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM), we develop a process model which highlights: a) the key states of the process through which the relationship between the MOB seeker (the man) and the MOB (the woman) unfolds, b) the transitions between states, and c) the triggering conditions for the transitions from one state to another. This study also highlights key motivations of the individuals participating in the MOB process, the effect of power and the role it plays in the dynamics of the relationships, the status of women and how their status evolves during the MOB process, and the unique affordance provided by IT as the relationships evolve.	emoticon;generative topographic map;process modeling	Suprateek Sarker;Suranjan Chakraborty;Patriya Silpakit Tansuhaj;Mark Mulder;Kivilcim Dogerlioglu-Demir	2013	ACM Trans.

This is especially useful in the case where those professionals struggle to make a living, as in sub-Saharan agriculture. Conditions in non-mechanised agriculture are highly variable, and 'the local farmer' often operates with non-formalised but specialist understanding of these conditions, and how they need to be negotiated. VGI applications for such farmer communities may help to corroborate that knowledge, and have it fed back to the same communities for further exploitation.  Of special importance in these applications is the notion of repetitive or cyclic activity. In this paper, we present an extended formal framework for these and apply it to a conceptualisation of cyclic, on-farm activities in coffee farming, as typically occurring in sub-Saharan economies. We start by adopting a model of cyclic change to formalise our conceptualisation of on-farm activities, reaching the conclusion that the framework requires extension to allow capturing more of the activity semantics. A proposal is made for that extension, and it includes notions of subcyclic intervals and cyclic aggregations. We subsequently demonstrate these extensions with our conceptualised on-farm activities, and discuss what added functionality they bring to an online information system, under development, that aims to better inform coffee farmers of good practice at designated locations.	denotational semantics;information system;volunteered geographic information	Clarisse Kagoyire;Rolf A. de By	2012		10.1145/2442952.2442965	geography;knowledge management;operations management;data mining	AI	-80.49632596568998	-5.533319052753297	165505

Although different models and platforms have been created for helping these particular issues, existing work tend to focus on only one or two of the previous matters. We propose the DoRES ontology for representing information sources, consolidating it into reports and then, representing event situation based on reports. Our approach is guided by the analysis of 1) the structure of a widely used situation awareness platform; 2) stakeholder interviews, and; 3) the structure of existing crisis datasets. Based on this, we extract 102 different competency questions that are then used for specifying and implementing the new three-tiers crisis model. We show that the model can successfully be used for mapping the 102 different competency questions to the classes, properties and relations of the implemented ontology.

81ed2c8fa044c7337b0b0e092c66718ebd385ead	the enlightened workplace	enlightened workplace	This special issue of AI & Society: The International Journal of Human Centred Systems (22.3 2008) brings together articles from around the world, each reflecting a human centred perspective on the workplace. Globalisation, technological change, new forms of work organisation, and demographic change have had radical but diverse impacts. A great deal can be learned from different practical experiences: dialogue can result in new hybrid approaches, and sustainable innovation. Rosemary Exton and Peter Totterdill take the approaches to workplace innovation, which have been developed and studied over the past decade in the UK and the European Union, and focus in particular on the work of hospitals, seen as complex work organisations. Trond Haga reflects on experience of networks and development coalitions, in Norway and the Nordic Countries, and gives an account of orchestration, offering insights into modern management. Four linked papers consider the changed workplace in international terms, with particular reference to Africa and the challenges presented by the ‘‘digital divide’’ between the information rich and the information poor. Anne Inga Hilsen and Richard Ennals consider demographic change. Simple forms of technology offer intergenerational links, which can transform work organisation and the requirement for learning. The tacit knowledge and experience of older workers is a vital resource. Arunas Augustinaitis, Richard Ennals, Egle Malinauskiene and Rimantas Petrauskas reflect on experience of economic, political and technological transition in Lithuania. They discuss national programmes, and issues for different generations, and explore the lessons that this may provide for developing countries in Africa.	ai & society	Richard Ennals	2007	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/s00146-007-0171-9	technological change;public relations;globalization;orchestration (computing);knowledge management;computer science;developing country;politics;tacit knowledge;european union	HCI	-77.75073337827243	-7.790180644003721	165939

Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports on the key findings from a survey of seven scientific disciplines, with analysis of data from an online questionnaire and a series of structured interviews, conducted with a representative cohort of researchers. Findings – The paper finds that significant support was expressed for the provision of bi-directional links between source and output repositories, tempered by a limited knowledge of repositories among the survey constituency and the need for reassurance on measures for the protection of data ownership. Diversity in the application of good data management practice is marked both between and within each of the disciplines surveyed, with solutions adopted characterised by a culture of self-sufficiency and the use of repositories driven by practical research requirements. Common areas for improvement have been recognised across the disciplines, notably in the processes described for the assignment of metadata, and opportunities for expert assistance in data management were identified. Research limitations/implications – Having identified the specificity of requirements and levels of understanding within individual disciplines, further research would benefit the design and alignment of repository and information services.

d743e4e99368168db96484a491f257804878e560	getting computer systems to function as team players	computer systems;team players	As a result of the ubiquity of computer networks, computer systems are increasingly acting as elements in a complex, distributed community of people and systems, rather than operating as solitary devices employed by a single person. Individuals in such communities may interact in various ways|competing, coordinating, collaborating. This talk will focus on those multi-agent scenarios and applications in which groups of agents work together to accomplish a joint activity or to achieve a common goal, that is, on situations in which agents collaborate. Many applications require such collaborative endeavors, and a major challenge for computer science is to determine ways to construct computer systems that are able to act eectively as collaborative team members. Teams may consist solely of computer agents, but often include both systems and people. Teams may persist over long periods of time (as do orchestras, sports teams, and systems administration groups), form spontaneously for a single group activity (as when a group forms for a programming project or to provide aid after a natural disaster), or come together repeatedly (as do surgical teams and airline crews). Team members must form commitments not only to the group action itself, but also to the activities of other participants that are in service of this group activity. Group decision-making processes are required to expand partial plans to more complete ones. In this talk, I will briefly review the major features of one model of collaborative planning, SharedPlans [GroszKra96,GroszKra99] and will describe eorts to develop collaborative planning agents and systems for human-computer communication based on this model. The model provides a framework in which to raise and address fundamental questions about collaboration and the construction of collaboration-capable agents. I will discuss recent approaches to three plan management processes|assessment of alternatives, commitment management, and group decision-making for recipe selection and task allocation|and will raise several challenges for future research.

The reform tried to increase and maintain the public telephone network while introducing a real and sustainable competition. All in all, the analysis reveals that, although teledensity rates increased, this expansion has been unequal between the different geographical and economical regions. Since the start of this decade, with the advent of the Information Society (IS), states are, if possible, more aware of the fact that the access of the whole population to advanced telecommunication services is essential for the economic development of their countries and the reduction of poverty. Thus, twenty years after the beginning of this process, Latin American countries face a double challenge: they must continue to move forward in the expansion of basic networks and, simultaneously, they need to start generalizing the access to services that allow their soon inclusion into the Information Society. This paper analyzes past, present and future policies of four representative Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru. The final goal of the paper is offering some guidelines for policies oriented towards the development of the Information Society while, at the same time, maintaining some of the basic objectives of universal access and deployment of communications infrastructures. Desde la década de los ochenta, pero sobretodo durante los noventa, los países latinoamericanos reformaron y privatizaron su industria de telecomunicaciones. Las reformas fueron diseñadas intentado lograr un equilibrio entre la introducción de una competencia real y sostenible, y el cumplimiento de objetivos en el despliegue de la red telefónica. En la actualidad, y desde el inicio de la década, con el advenimiento de la Sociedad de la Información, los Estados son, si cabe, más concientes del papel esencial que tiene el acceso de toda su población a los servicios de telecomunicación para el desarrollo económico de sus países y la reducción de la pobreza. Por ello, veinte años después, Latinoamérica afronta un doble reto: los países deben incrementar la cobertura y el despliegue de sus redes de comunicaciones básicas, y simultáneamente, dar los primeros pasos para la generalización del acceso a servicios avanzados que permitan su pronta y completa incorporación a la llamada Sociedad de la Información. Este estudio analiza cuatro países representativos de la región: Brasil, Chile, México y Perú. El objetivo del estudio es presentar algunas directivas que ayuden en la elaboración de planes para el desarrollo de la Sociedad de la Información, sin dejar de lado los objetivos básicos de Servicio Universal y despliegue de infraestructuras.	bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;emma;las vegas algorithm;linear algebra;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;power-on reset;software deployment;toda field theory;unique name assumption	Arturo Robles Rovalo;Claudio Feijóo;José Luis Gómez Barroso	2005			development economics;political science;public administration;economic growth	Security	-78.70002025867726	-8.343052915478156	167311

In this paper, we use publicly available archival data to explore the relationships among e-government maturity, corruption, and eco-efficiency (defined in terms of economic prosperity and environmental degradation). Results substantiate a significant relationship between e-government maturity and corruption, and e-government maturity and eco-efficiency through the mediating effects of corruption. The findings suggest that while e-government maturity did not contribute to eco-efficiency, its value could be realized indirectly via its impacts on corruption, which in turn influences eco-efficiency. Our findings contribute to the theoretical discourse on e-government impact by identifying the role of egovernment in a country and provide indications to practice on enhancing its eco-efficiency by managing the level of corruption.	capability maturity model;e-government;elegant degradation;pareto efficiency	Satish Krishnan;Thompson S.

2e600c3e4d4cf9814a1ae46c04f6edf7fa9fc0a6	an exploration of professional identity in the information technology sector	qa75 electronic computers computer science	At present the Information Technology profession appears to be dogged by high profile project failure, high graduate unemployment rates, employers unable to recruit suitable staff and a professional body under attack. It is not even clear that IT can be considered a profession when compared with other occupational groups in which professional bodies regulate entry and employers demand professional status from their employees. There are some advantages in belonging to a recognised profession, including external recognition and status; and, consequentially, disadvantages in not belonging. #R##N#To find out more about the nature of professional identity as experienced in the workplace, this study was designed to explore how IT professionals in leadership roles self-identify. Professional identity is defined to be a coherent self-conception based on skills, abilities, experiences and identification with a profession. The underlying identity theories accept a complex picture of multiple identities with identity commitment and salience affecting behaviour in different contexts. This study explored the nature of professional identity construction and adaptation for experienced IT professionals. As a previously unexplored group in a relatively new profession, the life narrative technique was used to identify factors in the construction and adaptation of identity with insights drawn over the course of a working life. #R##N#The findings revealed that participants constructed organisational, technical skills-based and leadership identities but there was little identification with the IT profession, as would have been in evidence, for example, through membership of the British Computer Society or developmental interactions with prototypical IT professionals. Analysis of the data uncovered mechanisms which could explain the lack of identification with the IT profession, including the rate of technological change and an underpowered professional body. The findings were evaluated and a set of emerging recommendations for stakeholders in a strong and stable IT sector were framed, including encouraging employers to endorse chartered status and careful consideration of the review on computing course accreditation underway.

In order to put the theoretical arguments into practice, the existing benefits and obstacles of implementing such strategies in reality are presented. Deriving from the analysis of the bottom-up approach is the identification of three key areas: basic needs, empowerment, and rural-based development. These are later discussed in the context of ICTs strategies. The theoretical discussion is exemplified in short explanatory cases.	bottom-up parsing;top-down and bottom-up design	Martina Fors;Alfredo Moreno	2002	Aslib Proceedings	10.1108/00012530210441746	information and communications technology;simulation;computer science;management;law;information technology	Robotics	-78.1464870163158	-7.184110523431071	169512

Six functions of Foresight for policy-making are elaborated on: 1. Informing policy: generating insights regarding the dynamics of change, future challenges and options, along with new ideas, and transmitting them to policy-makers as an input to policy conceptualisation and design. 2. Facilitating policy implementation: enhancing the capacity for change within a given policy field by building a common awareness of the current situation and future challenges, as well as new networks and visions amongst stakeholders. 3. Embedding participation in policy-making: facilitating the participation of civil society in the policy-making process, thereby improving its transparency and legitimacy. 4. Supporting policy definition: jointly translating outcomes from the collective process into specific options for policy definition and implementation. 5. Reconfiguring the policy system: in a way that makes it more apt to address long-term challenges. 6. Symbolic function: indicating to the public that policy is based on rational information. The relationship between these functions and the tensions that can arise when a Foresight exercise attempts to address more than one function are discussed. Possible approaches for Foresight practice to better achieve the targeted impact on policy-making are outlined and emerging guidelines for improving Foresight practice are presented.	transmitter	Olivier Da Costa;Philine Warnke;Cristiano Cagnin;Fabiana Scapolo	2008	Techn.

This paper offers a reflection about the methodological processes that underpin this transition, in response to the questions: How are design goals formulated in community informatics interventions that rely on data-intensive exploratory methodologies, and what factors and dynamics shape them? Guided by these questions, we shed light on various issues related to this transition by recounting and analysing cases taken from field experiences within three different community projects in Syria, Brazil and Mozambique. The article proposes that the transition is associated with shifts in intentionality, which are elusive and hard to grasp, particularly in participatory approaches. Three analytical categories are put forward to illuminate the dynamics of intentionality shifts along the continuum of transitioning from exploration to design. Reflections based on the empirical cases are contributed.	apache continuum;community informatics;crowdsourcing;data-intensive computing;emulator;framing (world wide web);intentionality;interaction;knowledge base;reflection (computer graphics);relevance;triune continuum paradigm	Ammar Halabi;Amalia G.

At the heart of this social and economic innovation is the online auction model, a concept that has been intensively investigated and used in developed countries. However, little knowledge exists about how these new models are used and implemented in developing countries, and about how existing theories are able to explain such an emerging innovative phenomenon. The article makes two main contributions. First, it applies a theoretical pluralist approach to further improve our understanding of MYC4, an online auction model for micro-lending purposes being applied in Africa and selected as our case study. Secondly, it uses the understanding produced from data analysis of MYC4 to validate propositions derived from three theoretical approaches. Our analysis shows that the three theoretical approaches differ in their basic assumptions – critical dimensions – and in the usefulness of their propositions, two of them being more valuable than the third one for drawing up guidelines for designing and implementing online auction markets and for identifying implications regarding the role of information, technology and the stakeholders involved.	theory	Eric van Heck;Marlei Pozzebon	2013			pluralism (political theory);management science;developing country;developed country;business;phenomenon;marketing;business model	AI	-78.05769133309157	-5.588450200121531	171169

However, not all the systems have adopted the same levels of verifiability nor the same range of cryptographic mechanisms. For instance, Estonia (2013) and New South Wales (Australia, 2015) started by adopting individual verifiability to their systems. Switzerland updated its regulation in 2014 to include individual and universal verifiability in order to by-pass the previous limitation of voting online up to 30% of the electorate. Geneva and Swiss Post voting systems are adapting their systems to this regulation and currently provide individual verifiability (and universal in the case of Swiss Post). In this exploratory paper, we study the different approaches followed by the election organizers that offer online voting, their current status and derived future tendencies.	formal verification	Jordi Puiggalí;Jordi Cucurull-Juan;Sandra Guasch;Robert Krimmer	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68687-5_15	business;public economics;cryptography;voting;public relations;government	AI	-79.78417574765254	-7.924003273259279	171363

The research will also suggest the Arab countries to implement certain initiatives to be taken in the future to be at par with the other developed and developing countries. A total of 71 studies including 51 from the developed and developing countries and 20 from the Arab countries were found suitable for our analysis. The result indicated that although the awareness about the KM practices has advanced in the Arab world in the recent past, it still needs to learn a lot from the successful establishment of KM in the public sector of developed and developing countries. The paper also acknowledges the theoretical contributions, limitations and suggests further research directions.	knowledge management	Fatmah Mohmmad H. Alatawi;Yogesh Kumar Dwivedi;Michael D.

The mention of gender issues in national ICT policies in Africa is still very scanty (where they exist). Many countries in Africa have no clear gender aspects incorporated into their national ICT policies. The chapter focuses on the imperativeness of ICTs to the livelihood of women in Africa, the need and urgency of increasing and encouraging women participation in all aspects of ICTs. The enactment and implementation of ICT policies and strategies targeting women population in both rural and urban areas is inevitable. Thus, status of gender inequality of ICT in Africa, strategies geared towards addressing gender inequalities in ICT in Africa and gender and ICT perspectives were discussed.		Stella E.

Buying fishing permits for legal fishing in waters owned by somebody else may look as rather a trivial exercise; it has turned out not to be trivial if you are a foreigner and you do not know where to go looking for the permits and you decide that you want to go fishing on the spur of a moment. We have developed a mobile service called MobiFish that allows the user to buy a fishing permit anytime and anywhere just by using his mobile phone. We have shown that MobiFish actually is a mobile value service. It is being tested and introduced in the Aland Islands.

Since more and more citizens are using cell phones and other mobile devices, it seems clear that there is an opportunity for government agencies to provide information and services using these technologies. Despite the relative success of some growing applications and the great number of mobile phones, mobile government has not evolved as one of the main channels for interacting with citizens. Aiming to understand the configuration of mobile government projects in practice, our research question is: how environment, structure, leadership, strategy and sustainability configure and interact in mobile government business models? The research has a qualitative character with multiple cases studies based on the analysis of twenty Mobile Government Projects using short message service (SMS) in the government of Paraná, Brazil. The life cycles of the twenty cases were identified and represented, from the birth to the survival phase. The major contribution of this paper is proposing a Dynamic Business Model for Mobile Government using SMS technology, based on the phases of the project life cycle.	e-government;interaction;mobile device;mobile phone	Beatriz Barreto Brasileiro Lanza;José Ramón Gil-García;Fernando Antonio Prado Gimenez	2017		10.1145/3085228.3085317	mobile business development;public relations;knowledge management;sms banking;computer science;mobile technology;short message service;mobile payment;mobile device;government;business model	HCI	-81.02621324791548	-8.53694087248882	175767
8a02ae360e4c203daaed9a61425f6738f3a3538d	korea's strategies for mobile technology standards in smart ecosystem		Prior to the introduction of smartphones, South Korea's mobile market had already recognised the early construction of 3.5G technology HSDPA, WiBro, commercial networks, and advanced networks as an important strategy to gain competitive advantage over the market. With the emergence of a smart ecosystem, however, the competition over 4G technical standards is considered to be vital for securing the mobile operating systems and collaborations with participants within the ecosystem, such as the alliances between the devices and content providers. Thus, departing from the viewpoint that a mobile carrier-led network is required to make constant investments and improvements to help create a competitive advantage over the market.

This paper outlines the problem faced by India in dealing with her rural poor, who constitute about 72.2% of 1027 million and live in 600,000 villages with poor or no infrastructure, and suggests ways to increase their income level. The government must redefine its policies and strategies, and deploy information and communication technologies (ICTs) innovations with application and active participation from development organizations (DOs) to achieve this. This paper highlights the status of ICTs in India and their role in social development, and discusses the case of telecentres, their benefit and overview of current initiatives with select examples. Further, it deals in detail with the sustainability of telecentres and analyses the emerging scenario using Gartner’s Hype Cycle. The study concludes that many ICT initiatives in India lack a comprehensive plan in addressing the target population, struggle to sustain due to insufficient infrastructure and are too ambitious as they are not equipped with appropriate technologies in serving the rural communities. To be successful, a telecentre model needs to be built upon the principles of multi-stakeholder partnership involving the government, private organizations and DOs for combining innovation, responsiveness with stability and public participation, and needs to include massive numbers of excluded people into the information world.	responsiveness;telecentre	Siriginidi Subba Rao	2008	Int J.

The objective is to model the political market for influence at the domestic level and at the international level, and to assess how new consultation procedures affect the final decision. It is based on public choice theory as well as on political science findings. We consider in this paper that lobbying groups have different strategies for influencing voters and decision-makers, with long-term and short-term effects. Our computational model enables us to represent the situation as an iterative process, in which past decisions have an impact on the preferences and choices of agents in the following period. In the paper, the model is applied to the European decision-making procedure for authorizing the placing on the market of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). It illustrates the political links between public opinions, lobbying groups and elected representatives at the national scale in the 15 country members, and at the European scale. It compares the procedure which was defined by the European 1990/220 Directive in 1990 with the new procedure, the 2001/18 Directive, which replaced it in 2001. The objective is to explore the impact of the new decision rules and the reinforced public participation procedures planned by the 2001/18 Directive on the lobbying efficiency of NGOs and biotechnology firms, and on the overall acceptability of the European decision concerning the release of new GMOs on the European territory.

Another worrying worldwide trend is the low turnout of voters. Postal voting has been tried for some elections. The Internet offers a new means of conducting votes. It is potentially less costly and results will be available at the close of polls. However there are a number of issues such as uniqueness and verifiability of the vote. This paper examines some of these issues. Students prepared prototype election systems to test the feasibility of online elections, then answered a questionnaire based on their perception of such a system and how the population would accept it.	formal verification;internet;postal;prototype	Emma Sharkey;John Paynter	2003		10.1145/2331829.2331851	bullet voting;spoilt vote;group voting ticket;ranked voting system;computer security	AI	-84.19298739142577	-9.360859036862115	176626
8fac0a49e7e66d8c4c58a080b96a93575aac5560	inclusion through the ages? gender, ict workplaces, and life stage experiences in england		This exploratory paper examines the various challenges that women working in information and communications technology (ICT) in England face in relation to their age, their life stage, and their career stage, with these three aspects being at least partially related. We first examine the literature currently available in relation to women, age and ICT work, arguing that age tends to be the forgotten variable in research on women in ICT. Using eight case studies of individual female ICT professionals in their twenties, thirties, forties, and fifties, we explore the nuances of experience these women have in relation to their career and their caring responsibilities. We consider the possibility that women in ICT may have heterogeneous experiences of working in what are often “masculinized” environments related to, but not determined by, their age. Based on our interpretations of our empirical data, we adapt Super’s career-stage theory to better frame our subsequent theoretical assertions. To conclude, we suggest that exploring age, life stage, and/or career stage in relation to female ICT professionals’ circumstances and experiences means that we can better theorize gender in the field of information systems, and hence develop more relevant gender inclusion strategies.

1c2f3df39dca55141f78bb26217232dc74e6e1d3	the mechanics of internet diffusion in india: lessons for developing countries	developing country	The issue of Internet diffusion in an economy over time is of interest to several stakeholders, including policy makers, regulators, investors, and businesses. It is particularly important in developing countries, which see the Internet as a major driver in achieving social and developmental goals. Concerns about the so-called digital divide also lend some urgency to the issue. However, Internet diffusion is driven by social as well as technical factors, and developing countries have distinctive characteristics that make their adoption process different from that in industrialized countries. This paper develops a causal model of Internet diffusion in developing countries, using the systems dynamics methodology. The modeling approach allows us to combine standard contagion mechanisms inherent in diffusion, such as innovators and imitators, with the distinctive regulatory, economic, and social circumstances in developing countries. The structure of the model is first justified using India as a specific developing country context. Next, the simulated values generated by this structural model are compared against actual values for Internet adoption in India for the period 19962001, and the fit is found to be reasonably good. These initial findings support model validity. Using a technique called dominant loop analysis the model suggests that, among all the different drivers, poor telecommunications infrastructure and high telephone charges are the major barriers to diffusion. In conclusion, we discuss the issues to be addressed in the remainder of this ongoing work.	causal model;icis;information systems;internet;mesh analysis;system dynamics;telephone exchange	Amitava Dutta;Rahul Roy	2001			the internet;causal model;system dynamics;developed country;economic growth;remainder;developing country;economics	Web+IR	-83.08566290646557	-8.86957743953017	177207
4a143f176f568beae14f93cffb7b0509cfccdd18	software startuppers took the medias paycheck medias fightback happens through startup culture and abstraction shifts		The collapse of old print media and journalism happened when the Internet, its solutions, services and communities became mature and mobile devices reached the market. The reader abandoned printed dailies for free and mobile access to information. The business of core industries of the early Internet and mobile communication, the mobile network manufacturers and operators are also in stagnation and decline. Therefore these industries may have similar interests to improve or even restructure their own businesses as well as to establish totally new business models by going into media and journalism. This paper analyses, first, the production flows and business models of the old and present media species. Second, it analyses the current market positioning of the network manufacturers and operators. Third, the paper suggests two avenues for media and journalism and the network manufacturers and operators, the Trio, to join their forces to update journalism and make all three stagnating industries great again. Last, we propose further research, development and discussion on the topic and envision possible futures for journalism, if the three would engage in cooperation. We see that the discussion should consist of ethical, societal and philosophical subjects because the development of the Internet solutions are based on “technology first” actions. We find and outline a tremendous opportunity to create a new industry with new actors through combining the interests of the network manufacturers, network operators and journalism in a systemic solution through a strategic alliance and collaboration Fig. 1. Software startuppers with their applications and communities will be the drivers for this abstraction shift in media and journalism.

This is a case study of South Africa, a developing country that has embraced the digital transformation agenda to promote the transformation of government, business and society among other things. Using institutional theory as our theoretical lens, we explore the implementation or policy reforms aimed at promoting the digital transformation of South Africa into an inclusive digital society. This study found that challenges associated with the implementation of policy reforms aimed at promoting the transition were as a result of poor coordination, fragmentation and poor cohesion among government departments coordinating the digital transformation agenda. Inclusion and digital access also require a more integrated approach in the coordination and implementation of social and economic policy that extends beyond technology.	fork (software development);group cohesiveness;social inequality	More Ickson Manda;Judy Backhouse	2018		10.1145/3209415.3209486	poor coordination;digital transformation;e-government;computer science;economic growth;public relations;cohesion (chemistry);institutional theory;inclusive growth;developing country;government	HCI	-78.2528620712372	-6.924403325501046	181494

High-bandwidth Internet will be provided through a national broadband network to be rolled out gradually and which began in 2011. The framework is based around four key aspects: (1) identifying provision of the national broadband network as an intervention, (2) specification of important outcomes, (3) understanding the behavioural link between intervention and outcomes and (4) conduct of high-quality population-based empirical research. The framework is sufficiently flexible that it can be adapted and applied to various regions of Australia and, depending on the appropriate focus, to the conduct of different types of studies. It is hoped that, by focusing attention on the human behavioural link between high-bandwidth Internet provision and individual outcomes in the general community, we will be able to identify ways of promoting social inclusion and other benefits through appropriate use of the national broadband network .

40bcfdf836ccd0e26ac8be7d5028dd0e928f728a	the pros and cons of digital divide and e-readiness assessments	digital divide	"""Evolving information and communication technologies (ICTs) have yielded new terms like “information society,” “digital divide,” and “e-readiness” which have attracted many scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. Therefore, in recent years numerous attempts have been done to develop e-readiness and digital divide models oriented toward certain objectives. In this research, these models are investigated with view to their definitions and methodologies, and their strengths and weaknesses are identified. These findings can help researchers and policymakers select the models that fit in with their objectives as well as identify the defects of previous models and rectify them in their own models. Moreover, the extensive literature review led to an integrated model which is proposed to assess the e-readiness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Such a model can serve as a basis and standard for developing comprehensive models in SMEs.

It is essential to understand what it means for a country or economy to be “e-ready” and conduct an evaluation based on objective criteria to establish basic benchmarks. Therefore, if a country is to narrow the digital divide, an understanding of where that country currently stands vis-à-vis the information society must be achieved, which is called “e-readiness.” Until now, various academic institutions, private organizations, and commercial publishers have put forward models for assessing and measuring e-readiness and the digital divide. These earlier measurements should be implemented for providing solid foundations for next stages of digital divide analysis and narrowing the gap. This paper addresses current widely diffused measurement instruments with the purpose of measuring e-readiness and the digital divide and their strengths and weaknesses. DefiNiNG tHe DiGital DiViDe There has been widespread debate about the definition of the digital divide and of the empirical analyses of its components (BarzilaiNahon, 2006). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2001) defined the digital divide as differences between individuals, households, companies, or regions related to the access to and use of ICT (Vehovar et al., 2006). The various factors may cause such a divide such as historical, socioeconomic, geographic, educational, behavioral, generation factors, or the physical incapability of individuals. There are a myriad of studies that address the factors influencing the digital divide and the plentiful models that measure it in terms of different factors widening inequalities including income, occupation, gender and age, education, geographic centrality, ethnicity and race, religion, language, family structure, physical capacity, frequency, time online, purpose, skills and experience, autonomy, affordability, competitive market structure, ownership and density of computers and Web sites, communication infrastructure, equipment, social support, policy structure. In this paper, a brief focus is centered on some of the efforts that are more popular (for more information, see also Barzilai-Nahon, 2006). In one study, DiMaggio and Hargittai (2001) pointed out that there are at least five factors of digital inequality: equipment, autonomy of use, skill, social support, and the purpose of using the Internet. Another framework, the MOSAIC model, was built as part of the “Global Diffusion of the Internet (GDI) Project” by Wolcott, Press, McHenry, Goodman, and Foster (2001). They examined the digital divide in terms of the diffusion of the Internet in a country based on six discrete valued factors: pervasiveness, geographic dispersion, sectoral absorption, connectivity infrastructure, organizational infrastructure, and sophistication of use. In addition, Corrocher and Ordanini (2002) quantified the digital divide as a multidimensional construct by combining multiple socio-economic factors into one. Their composite digitization index is based on six factors: markets, diffusion, infrastructures, human resources, competitiveness, and competition. Similarly, Mossberger, Tolbert, and Stansbury (2003) distinguished between an access divide, a skills divide, an economic opportunity divide, and a democratic divide. Orbicom (2005), the Network of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Chairs in Communications, advocated a framework for measuring the digital divide that develops concepts such as information density (info-density) and information use (info-use) (Sciadas, 2005). Finally, based on the TAI (UNDP) and the Industrial Development Scoreboard, Archiburgi and Coco (2004) developed the ArCo Index, which consists of eight indicators that depend on three main factors: the creation of technology, infrastructure, and human development skills. 27 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/pros-cons-digital-divide-"""	baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);centrality;coco/r;computer;e-commerce;fax;graphics device interface;information design;intel technology journal;internet;ncsa mosaic;pa-risc;rectifier;social inequality;social support;uniform resource identifier;visual instruction set;web page	Mohammad Reza Hanafizadeh;Payam Hanafizadeh;Abbas Saghaei	2009	IJEA	10.4018/jea.2009092901	digital divide;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;management science;world wide web	Web+IR	-83.00727703594633	-7.50720816605589	183414

8406ba378cc74f6989743066c84fd611947484b3	the effects of successful ict-based smart city services: from citizens' perspectives		The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) applications for the development of innovative, sustainable, and smart cities has become a new model for municipal cooperation between government and corporations. Smart cities contribute to social stability and economic prosperity by encouraging and enabling corporations to invest their resources and expertise in the cities, and by providing more prosperity and contentment for their citizens. Smart city services provide citizens with an improved living environment and increase their overall quality of life. Since the citizens are the users of the services, it is vitally important that their ideas and perspectives are taken into account during the planning and management of such services. This study surveyed citizens in Taiwanese cities that had all participated in the Intelligent Community Forum smart city campaigns at least once. The findings reveal that citizens are willing to accept and use ICT-based smart city services if the services are designed with innovative concepts that secure their privacy and offer a high quality of services. The more they use the services, the higher the quality of life achieved. The only factor that does not influence citizens' acceptance and usage of ICT-based smart city services is their city engagement. The study contributes to the academic literature and also provides practical pointers for cities and technology suppliers embarking on smart city initiatives.	display resolution;smart city;the quality of life	Hsiaoping Yeh	2017	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2017.05.001	public relations;environmental resource management;services computing;economic growth	HCI	-79.880340802377	-8.284150144481197	184324

Based on publicly available archival data from 183 countries, for a cross-sectional period of 2004 to 2008, our results generally supported the hypothesized model. Results indicate that voice and accountability was negatively related to e-government maturity. Also, while political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and rule of law were positively related to e-government maturity, control of corruption was not significantly associated with it. Further, while regulatory quality (and control of corruption) positively moderated the effect of government effectiveness (and rule of law) on e-government maturity, the relationship of voice and accountability with egovernment maturity was not contingent on political stability. Our findings contribute to the theoretical discourse on “governance–e-government maturity” by identifying the critical roles of governance dimensions in a country, and providing indications to practice on enhancing its e-government maturity by managing governance dimensions.	archive;capability maturity model;complementarity theory;congo bongo;contingency (philosophy);cross-sectional data;e-government;imperative programming;switzerland;visualizing energy resources dynamically on the earth	Satish Krishnan;Thompson S.

This is followed by an examination of how to best support these efforts. Subsequently, we describe design problems inherent in emergency decision ­support systems, the genesis of such issues, and how to overcome them. In ­particular, this chapter describes the impact of the threat rigidity syndrome and information ­overload and how to mitigate their effects. We describe current research efforts to promote effective decision making. Characteristics of High Reliability Organisations (HROs) enable their effective response by utilising a set of practices to manage low probability/high consequence events, focusing on the best feasible solutions using the concept of “muddling through” (Weick and Sutcliffe 2001, 2007; Lindbolm 1959). Finally, we provide concluding observations in which we reiterate some of the most critical tactics needed to promote effective decision making by large groups responding to and recovering from a disaster or catastrophic event.

Respondents reported radically different experiences with, and consequences of, the GIS technology. In North County, participants considered GIS to be responsible for transforming the way that work was accomplished and for changing patterns of communication among departments. In South County, the same GIS technology was implemented with little social consequence. These divergent outcomes are associated with differences in four specific processes related to the implementation of the GIS in the two organizations: initiation, transition, deployment, and spread of knowledge. In North County, implementation was initiated by an influential group of users (geographers) who positioned the technology as a shared resource that built upon existing competencies.

67f9a734c493a16cafcbbfe7485443df16caefe6	book review: the information revolution and developing countries	developing country	This book explores the role of structure and human agency in the evolution of information and communication technology (ICT) policies and implementation in the developing world. To provide explanations for the nature and extent of ICT transformations in these countries, Wilson develops a theoretical framework which he calls the ‘strategic restructuring’ (SRS) model. The model is based on a framework that allows an analysis of how socioeconomic and political structures intersect with the actions of individuals and networks to determine how the ICT revolution unfolds in particular national contexts. The model also integrates the role of international factors in ICT policies and diffusion. An important contribution of this model is the interdisciplinary focus that it adopts, which helps to weave together multiple factors that influence ICT innovations in specific locales. This is a positive movement away from the monocausal explanations that have so often been applied in this context. While Wilson looks at general patterns for ICT innovation, adoption and diffusion in the global south, the core research on which the analyses are based derive from case studies from Brazil, Ghana and China. The evidence suggests that while structures constrain or facilitate ICT developments, individuals and networks (i.e. champions) play critical roles in promoting technological change. The macro-level comparative analysis contributes to our understanding of commonalities across different countries in the south, while ensuring insights into the unique circumstances that shape ICT adoption and diffusion. Wilson examines the digital divide in a global context, situating it within a framework of access that is conceptually rich. By expanding the concept of access to encompass not just physical access but also financial, cognitive, content, design and political factors, Wilson allows us to ascertain more accurately how different groups are disadvantaged in relation to ICTs.

The aim is to explore the current context for the design and development of IT tools that may facilitate cooperation and coordination in elderly care at home. The focus of the study is the use of a tool, a binder, which collects material considered as important to sustain cooperation between and within the two services. The paper illustrates concrete aspects of how different types of material is utilised and how the actual use of the binder reveals both advantages and disadvantages. Through focusing on the binder, aspects that are crucial to consider also when designing IT tools are made visible. These aspects include the need to support the integration of home care information and the importance of assisting asynchronous communication through the facilitation of informal information. It is also necessary to consider the mobile nature of the home care work, and the importance of a patient-centric view that promotes information sharing between the heterogeneous network of actors involved in the home care process, including the care receiver and relatives.	file binder	Alexandra Petrakou	2007			social science;simulation;heterogeneous network;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;asynchronous communication;distributed computing;management science;communication;management;world wide web	HCI	-80.79175585324495	-6.423788765943928	186366

The decision-making process uses multi-methodological evaluations in order to support the development of scenarios and alternatives policy strategies, aimed at pre-order a territory development system subject of study. The methodological pathway is structured to allow the interaction among different techniques, which are selected in order to outline a decision support system, dynamic, flexible and adaptive, sensitive to the specificities of the context and oriented to the development of intervention strategies based on of experts and common knowledge, and on recognized and shared values. The selection of ‘conscious actions’ helps to reduce conflicts turning them in synergies, recognizing that the essential components of a landscape are multidimensional and complex and where interact different systems of values and relationships. Therefore, the strategies will be feasible or practicable in proportion to what projects will tend to achieve the idea of “scenario” for the site shared by social and institutional actors of the local system.

(BMI). Through qualitative interviews of 14 participants as different stakeholders, this study investigates and observes actual practices and obstacles that the BMI startups would encounter while acquiring data for their own products, as well as their insights for those who are eager to change and improve the current environment.Our findings reveal an inconvenient truth that the cost of data acquisition is very high, not only in terms of monetary price but also strict regulations. Interestingly, many of the BMI startups in our interviews hope that the regulations can be more transparent and well-round, rather than relaxing the regulations.

1b78dc3c50355126b0e1d7b6d771369dece19cf6	exploring mobile government from the service quality perspective		Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify service quality dimensions and their sub-dimensions for mobile government services. Despite studies conducted on mobile services, there is lack of a comprehensive framework of mobile government service quality. Researchers and practitioners must outline a taxonomy of mobile government service quality before they can begin to test their effects empirically. It cannot be assumed that e-government is the same as m-government. Therefore, it is important to understand the dimensions that affect mobile government service quality. Design/methodology/approach –Mobile government service quality dimensions were extracted from the literature on m-government from its development and transition from e-government to service models being used. This helps understand what service quality dimensions are necessary when creating more efficient, reliable, and responsible forms of m-government. The dimensions are demonstrated within a holistic framework of m-government service quality, presented for both academic and practitioner appreciation. Findings – This paper identifies 20 mobile government service quality sub-dimensions classified within six dimensions. Originality/value – The literature on mobile government service quality is scarce. With the expectation of mobile subscriptions worldwide reaching 8 billion by 2016, it is the most lucrative time to be researching how the design of mobile government affects service quality. This paper is the first to provide information on m-government service quality dimensions available for assessment.	e-government;holism;quality of service	Hajar Saeed Al-Hubaishi;Syed Zamberi Ahmad;Matloub Hussain	2017	J.

Social studies of smart grids have been undertaken that utilise practice theory to explore and gain insight on the development of smart grids with a particular focus on households. This perspective usefully describes practices in which electricity is used in households. However, reducing smart grid ecologies to everyday household practices may limit the potential of practice theory to understand development of smart grids. Thus in this paper we explored the potential of practice theory to account for practices performed by actors associated with smart grids beyond households.

The relevance of incorporating social imperatives in scholarship focused on technology adoption is due to its role in sustaining the process of adoption and diffusion. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered from a focus group made up of twenty-seven Agribusiness proprietors affiliated with a state cooperative based in the south-eastern Nigerian state of Ebonyi. Findings This article puts forward an argument that to ensure successful diffusion of innovation, a balance must be maintained between the amount of effort expended in the design of ICT and social factors such as language and traditional life. We find that a willingness of indigenous ICT users is particularly influenced by the recognition and incorporation of visible social imperatives during the adoption process.	conceptual schema;denial-of-service attack;experience;focus group;futures studies;mathematical optimization;relevance;social network;virtual community	Bartholomew Aleke;Udechukwu Ojiako;David W.

Science and Technology Studies (STS) have showed that for understanding success and failure of phenomena, one has to take a symmetrical approach and thus use the same concept for analyzing success and failure. In this article we analyze the success of OZIS, a communication protocol that makes it possible for pharmacists to exchange medication data by sharing a regionally accessible electronic medication record. Though OZIS serves a common goal - reducing medication errors - the stakeholders that are involved also have other, competing, interests. By focussing on the context and more specifically the interests of the stakeholders, we will show how the success of OZIS can be explained. By doing this, we will also show that this context is highly dynamic and that continuously changing incentives and constraints within the context lead to both facilitating and threatening the success of OZIS.	communications protocol;patients;interest	Arjen P.

The drivers and critical success factors of this framework are identified from the literature and a survey of the views of senior strategists in the New Zealand health sector. The success factors are associated with key tasks in the framework that identify suitable applications, channel development activity, and confirm activity by continued support of innovation whilst moving successful applications into the mainstream. The two most important outcomes from the research are that m-health has a crucial, even inevitable, role to play in future healthcare, and the development and exploitation of m-health demands a top-down strategy or framework to match and encourage bottom-up innovation by healthcare practioners. Without such a strategy to guide (but not direct) innovation, many otherwise valuable advances will not be sustainable and resources will be wasted on questionable applications that will slow development and reduce credibility.

8ed8a66cd962ebc326605276a5aef9bc7103abc9	when technology collaborates: politics and the aesthetic of “we” human-and-technology		This essay proposes “We” human-and-technology as the new human identity performed by the collaborative action of human and technology. Its aim is to open a new way for intersections of art, technology and humanities, through the political and aesthetic intimacy of human and technology in the collaborative action based interdependent perspective. “We” human-and-technology emphasizes the process of when the collaborative action of human and technology is performed. It shows that technology as power and knowledge relations intervenes on the knowledge system, in particular, the binary frame reinforcing a mutual degradation between human and technology, thought and action. In the collaboration of “We” human-and-technology, technology’s interventions focuses on two ideas: Enframing and the fetish. The former presents that the binary frame is an inversion. It uses an instrument for ideology subordinating both humans and technology into the instrument. The latter reveals that the binary frame of “Us” versus “Them” governs our senses through the fetish as blinded practices and beliefs. It implies that how the instrumental understanding of technology conducts the fetishism distorting relations between human and technology.		Hyunkyoung Cho;Timothy W.

Using an information processing decision making perspective and building on unique characteristics of VWs, this paper proposes a nomological net for adaptive use intention (AUI) of VWs for workplace collaborations. AUI implies intention to use a technology in a setting different from the one for which it was initially designed. We study the AUI of VWs as a workplace collaboration tool which were originally conceived as recreational gaming platforms. Decisionmaking literature directs us to reduction of perceived cognitive burden and minimization of risk as the two key motivations for VWs’ AUI. Building on these motivations, the paper identifies cognitive absorption and user trust in VWs as the mechanisms leading to individual-level AUI decision. Drawing on social cognitive theory and literature on trust, the proposed model not only re-specifies the concept of cognitive absorption in the context of VWs but also relates it to the level of trust and usage intention for VWs. We empirically tested the proposed model via data collected from 197 VW users in Singapore. Results demonstrate the significant roles that cognitive absorption’ and user trust play in VW’s usage as a collaboration tool. Further, through a series of posthoc analyses, we demonstrate the imperative need for considering both cognitive absorption and user trust together in the proposed research model for theoretical parsimony. We also discuss implications for research and practice emerging out of this study.		Shalini Chandra;Shirish C. Srivastava;Yin Leng Theng	2012	J.

Trusted services are essential for Europe’s growth into the information society, Europe should have native competence in trusted services, but Europe is perceived as lagging behind. We outline the problems European players face when trying to become (and remain) profitable in TS, provide predictions for the future (using four scenarios: growth/explosion, stagnation, maturity and decline/crackdown), and rate the feasibility of the various possible business models. Pervasive myths and misunderstandings surrounding trusted services are clarified.

The poster uses emergency & disaster response management as the exemplar for the over-arching concept. Effective emergency & disaster response management requires a far more mature and complex approach than has been heretofore applied. Current practices have made strides in many areas yet a fully effective integrated system is yet to be developed. A more effective approach requires an inter-organizational, multidiscipline collaborative methodology that enables incongruent communities to situate themselves into a coordinated functional matrix. This matrix would facilitate self-alignment into the overall emergency preparedness, response and recovery environment thereby improving assessment, the identification of gaps and the acceleration of effective response. This more holistic approach requires committed collaboration and the application of appropriate technology to establish a truly useful coordinating framework.	holism;windows preinstallation environment	W.

The research relied principally on interaction with the political leadership and selected communities in Egbedore Local Government Area in Osun State, south-west Nigeria to ascertain how CICs can provide a viable platform for increased participation in governance at the local community level. By providing a means of information flow between citizens and the elected community officials with respect to basic public services such as reporting crime, monitoring weather trends, providing information on agricultural products prices, collection of local taxes, e-voting etc, the likelihood of a disruptive breakdown of law and order due to lack of communication between leaders and followers can be greatly minimized. The challenges to implementing such community systems in Nigeria are also highlighted.		Kayode M. Olaniyan;Sanjo O.

3be355db12152eb54f6adeac49a5bf33af118f8b	making sense to decreasing citizen eparticipation through a social representation lens		"""This paper investigates the development of an electronic platform by a local government with the goal of increasing citizens' participation in public decision-making process, particularly the modality known as participatory budgeting. The local government of Belo Horizonte, a Brazilian municipality, decided to use web-based technologies to create a project called digital participatory budgeting (DPB), whose purpose was to include new segments of the population –particularly the middle class and youth – in the process of prioritizing the allocation of investments in the city's public works. The project was launched in 2006 and repeated in 2008 and 2011. Intriguingly, however, citizen participation decreased significantly. This study seeks to understand why citizens' participation decreased over time, despite the availability of a cutting-edge, user-friendly and iterative web-based platform to help connect citizens to the process. The theoretical approach is based on social representation theory (SRT) and the methodology of critical discourse analysis (CDA) of 101 documents and 19 interviews. This combination of SRT and CDA helps in understanding how people gave meaning to a new social object - the digital participatory budgeting – through their voices. Simultaneously, this approach represents a skillful approach to uncovering power imbalances signaled by """"silences"""". The results suggest that deviations in the social representation process, namely, trivialization and reification, help us to understand the process through which citizen participation decreases.

In a group of collaborators whose workflows can differ substantially, creating broad and cohesive awareness around security can be difficult, especially for spaces like news institutions, where continuous collaboration must be carried out under continuous threat of cyberattack. Using a sensemaking framework, we analyzed interviews with two levels of organizational actors, lower-level reporters and higher-level supervising editors. Fragmented sensemaking, in which individuals maintain their own discrete and disconnected approaches to the complex situation of computer security, was pervasive. Storytelling as a sensemaking strategy, however, was found in both levels. In particular, while personal stories were shared by all partici-pants, higher-level editors on average shared more second-hand narratives they'd heard about other organizations.Noting that editors described how such second-hand stories shaped their security decisions, we conclude with recommendations for integrating storytelling methods into robust training modules for computer security in collaborative working environments.	computer security;fragmented object;grapple;level editor;network security;pervasive informatics;sensemaking	Elizabeth Anne Watkins;Franziska Roesner;S Elizabeth McGregor;Byron Lowens;Kelly Caine;Mahdi N.

The initial hypothesis departs from the consideration of the scarce social capital of organizations that limits development's sustainability. The research method employed is the ethnographic complemented with field work supported by informal interviews, documental and bibliographic research. The hypothesis of this research is proved empirically and confirms similar findings by the research conducted on the mainstream theory of social capital and its implications on economic development. The outcomes of the application demonstrate that the drama of economic efficiency and sustainable development of micro-business is tied to constrain of social capital. This finding has implications for the design and implementation of economic and social policies oriented towards the improvement of economic growth and sustainable development.		José G.

The context is the UK Education Departments' Superhighways Initiative (EDSI), which was jointly funded by the four education departments of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Unusually, the evaluation, which was large scale and employed several teams of evaluators, had a real opportunity to inform the development of policy. Problems of working for multiple stakeholders arose from the tight control that the sponsors exercised over the structure, style and content of the report. In addition to the usual problems of conflicting interests between stakeholders, the Scottish evaluators experienced problems relating to the polarised political context in the UK prior to the general election of 1997. The successful public relations exercise that created the EDSI programme, with commercial sponsorship for projects and government funding only for the evaluation, was an additional factor in determining the evaluators' roles and relationships with stakeholders.	brilliance;control theory;failure;human–computer interaction;interpreter (computing);s/pdif;speculative execution	Bridget Somekh;Joanna McPake;John Hall	1999	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/A:1009640109517	public relations;information and communications technology;environmental resource management;policy analysis;evaluation;methodology;management science;management;law	HCI	-80.42622315994645	-5.863638621884688	193845

Economic theorists such as Porter, have shaped many of policies being adopted, from a macro-economic perspective, yet the process by which actors within the group are helped (or hindered) in aligning knowledge, expertise and interests is less well understood. The implementation and development of clusters is subject to a range of local socio-technical and socio-political dynamics, which also need to be taken account of if the anticipated benefits such as wealth creation and competitiveness are to be realised. The paper uses the outcomes of research in several regional clusters to highlight recurring issues associated with the alignment of distributed knowledge and stakeholder interests, and in particular, the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The paper suggests that such barriers impact on the ability of clusters to create value for regions, particularly in relation to the opportunities for the creation of employment through local SMEs that are often cited as the basis for such investment. The authors argue for the provision of opportunities to sharing knowledge and expertise within and between clusters, to ensure early identification and collective engagement of stakeholders with issues on the ground, given the evidence that SME are under-represented in policy and strategy development, and that this undermines the competitiveness and the benefits of investment in regional clusters. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This rigidity arises in part from viewing work processes as unfolding along a single line of temporally chained activities. In reality, work evolves both horizontally, in the cooperation of causally unrelated, but information-sharing tasks, and vertically, in the coordination of causally-dependent activities. In this paper, we present our process modeling approach which (1) views documents and tasks as duals of each other, capturing horizontal cooperation and (2) exploits constraints to express the SOP dependencies among related activities and documents within the framework of generative rule-based grammars for processes. thus handling vertical coordination.	generalized phrase structure grammar;logic programming;process (computing);process modeling;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Natalie S.

We focus here on obtaining employee-engagement insights from messages posted on the enterprise Social Media. At the start, management feedback indicated that while current tools provide aggregated data views for overall trends, they were also of 'low-resolution' and lacking in specific causal details needed for implementing interventions at the individual actor or team level. This led to the formulation of a 'high-resolution' Observatory - an innovation to aid the design of interventions to increase employee engagement. The Observatory framework treats the enterprise as a complex system with macro, meso and micro contexts that have to be aligned through 'little experiments'. The implementation is a semantic network-based feature at the meso (infrastructure) level. The management users felt this feature allowed them design interventions and observe the results needed to arrive at decisions beneficial to the actors at the micro level. This also achieved goals for the executives at the macro level. The use of technology to create semantic network views and the lessons learned are also presented.	causal filter;complex system;experiment;image resolution;mesoscopic physics;real-time transcription;semantic network;social computing;social media;social network	Jayashree Ramanathan;Zhe Xu;Ramiya Venkatachalam;Rajiv Ramnath;R.

21d937d114bfc58273727dbb4177e12a37a18093	modeling a community as a system of systems: a methodology for data integration		We live, work and play within interacting and embedded systems of systems. While systems of systems engineering may be perceived as primarily physical or “hard” infrastructure, we live in critical systems of systems that emerge within physical and social systems. One such example is the living community system, one that strongly impacts our health and the way we live. The complex interconnected living environment is becoming a central focus for improvement given its strong influence on health in general and on how chronic conditions arise and persist. Such a strong focus on our community living environment has prompted various level regions (i.e. cities, districts) to take action in their communities. Stakeholders have turned to national data sources to inform a region of the many factors that describe it. However, these multiple factor datasets should be analyzed holistically as a system rather than individually. Consequently, this work develops a system of systems community typology from national data describing types of factor value combinations within a region. This paper presents a method of integrating multifactorial community data using a clustering based method to determine holistic system of systems community typologies.	biological anthropology;cluster analysis;computer file;embedded system;factor analysis;holism;interaction;social system;system of systems;systems engineering	Inas Khayal	2018	2018 13th Annual Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SoSE)	10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428766	data integration;system of systems;management science;cluster analysis;social system;distributed computing;computer science;typology	DB	-78.28001772729996	-3.915487271548684	197084

Interagency collaboration initiatives of this nature result in the creation of Public Safety Networks (PSNs). PSNs may originate at any level of government, and their user base may span a single or multiple geographies. In this study, we focus on PSNs that are created to be used in the United States at the state-level; that is, they aim to support some combination of police and other agencies throughout one of the fifty U.S. states. The study seeks to describe the size and maturity of extant state-level PSNs, based upon factors derived from rational choice and institutional theories. For each state, we have collected contextual data representing 135 different characteristics and descriptors of potentially relevant state-level attributes. We produce a parsimonious set of factors that predict public safety collaboration, identify which factors cluster together, and confirm that they evidence an underlying structure consistent with what rational choice and institutional theories would predict. These are then analyzed against size and maturity indicators drawn from an extensive data set of PSN characteristics and attributes, as an initial effort to explain differences among state public safety programs.

In addition, e-libraries, though in some ways run for noncommercial goals, have been faced with great attention from customers, which makes them maintain and develop their services. The authors have come to a conclusion that the only way to increased financial benefits is through better service. Organizations as a part of the domestic information community therefore, have turned to implementation of new methods such as management of customer relationships. This paper aims to develop a valid and reliable method for evaluating and measuring the management relationship level with customers in e-libraries. In addition, the research tries to find how successful Yazd University Libraries has been to meet students’ expectations, as a guideline to take steps toward improving its services. Design/methodology/approach – The research was conducted among 381 e-library services users in Yazd University, using a questionnaire comprised of 78 items. Moreover, exploratory factor analysis was used to classify the CRM attributes into latent “CRM factors”. Finally, the study measures the gap between users’ expectations and perceptions about each CRM factor at Yazd University. Findings – The paper found only 37 of 78 items suitable enough to be used for CRM measurement in e-libraries. Results of factor analyzing show that there are three main factors in e-libraries’ CRM; two of them may need revision for improvement in meeting students’ demands. Originality/value – The concept of customer relationship management assessment and improvement is relatively new among e-institutions especially libraries, and there is a lack of studies focusing of CRM in the digital world. This is the first study of its kind to survey the CRM scale in digital libraries. In addition, the study provides useful insights and guidance for managers to measure and improve CRM system toward improving customer satisfaction.	customer relationship management;digital library;exploratory factor analysis;library (computing)	Reza Jamali;Asghar Moshabaki;Hajar Aramoon;Akbar Alimohammadi	2013	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640471311299173	customer to customer;digital library;computer science;knowledge management;customer satisfaction;customer retention;management;world wide web;relationship marketing	Web+IR	-83.03018957117114	-7.3036387870868875	197737

Such spaces include the use of global online social networks, locative media, e-participation platforms, online neighbourhood communities and so forth. Unlike the physical urban space that it overlays, this new and rapidly emerging virtual space has practically no capacity constraints. However, it is subject to inequalities in terms of access, representation, participation, and ownership. In this research note—an interdisciplinary collaboration between a computer scientist and an urban planner—we wish to study the role of wireless technology, which enables the easy deployment of local networks operating outside the public Internet, and the role of the free and open source social software, which facilitates the easy development of customized local applications, allowing citizens to shape their emerging hybrid space. We suggest that this sort of do-it-yourself (DIY) networking can be realised according to citizens’ values, objectives and the particularities of the environment, and could ultimately enable them to compete with large ICT corporations such as Google and Facebook for their “right(s) to the hybrid city”. We employ the urban sidewalk metaphor as an application that is subject to hybrid design and can profit significantly from the special characteristics of DIY networks.

Activity Theory is argued to be particularly relevant in the context knowledge work since the body of knowledge is a historically accumulated social construction. Situated Activity Theory makes a distinction between activity, tasks and encounters, the first two following the traditional distinction between activity and action in Activity Theory. Encounters are incorporated to model explicitly the temporal organisation of work. Referring to the high variety of knowledge work, Situated Activity Theory suggests an instansiation process in which an activity is instansiated into an action working on a single object of work. The culturally developed activity system is seen to serve as a significant resource and constraint in the process. Influenced by the ideas of situated action the instansiation process is viewed as continuous process that takes place in a close concert with the action as it unfolds.	critical graph;language/action perspective;situated;ver (command)	Juhani Iivari;Henry Linger	1999		10.1109/HICSS.1999.772702	activity theory;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;body of knowledge;management science;social constructionism;situated	HCI	-82.55781625088628	-4.441174639770041	198466

Under explored in the literatures are situations when the two logics are experienced simultaneously by one professional group or even one individual. This study intends to shed some light on the issue by studying logic synthesis practices of independent app entrepreneurs. The opening of and infrastructure support from mobile software platforms creates ample entrepreneurial opportunities for independent third-party developers. Meanwhile, it also exposes developers to the challenges of logic tensions. How developers synthesize logic tensions not only depends on their own experience, it is contingent on platform-level influence as well. Through a qualitative study of independent iOS app entrepreneurs, we juxtapose mobile software developers’ professional logic with the market logic, and explicate ways in which logic synthesis practices are performed in this context.	ios	Yixin Qiu;Anand Gopal;Il-Horn Hann	2011			public relations;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;artificial intelligence;marketing;operating system;institutional theory;mobile computing;management	ML	-82.81708179732927	-6.763086473016893	198954

The geographical connection of Eurasia additionally enables rail freight via the Eurasian landbridge. This transport concept reduces lead time compared to sea freight at lower cost than air or sea-air freight and hence fits into a strategic niche between established modes. These characteristics facilitate developments in supply chain management like increasing transport distances and continuous cost reduction together with relatively new trends (smaller, but more frequent shipments, flexibility and sustainability) that are only partly satisfied by contemporary modes. At this moment, the Eurasian landbridge is at an immature state, used by few shippers. This paper intends to identify factors that enable, respectively, inhibit Eurasian rail freight and understand how inhibitors can be overcome. The research based on case studies reviewing literature and conducting interviews to investigate individual landbridge routes. Besides providing secondary data, literature identified stakeholders and thus served as input for 24 semi-structured interviews to gather primary data.
