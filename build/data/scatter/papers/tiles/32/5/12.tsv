97388d2300849bf612d9c33743df8645e30dbbd0	deception detection for the tangled web		Deception is a reasonably common part of daily life that society sometimes demonstrates a degree of acceptance of, and occasionally people are very willing to be deceived. But can a computer identify deception and distinguish it from that which is not deceptive?  We explore deception in various guises, differentiating it from lies, and highlighting the influence of medium and message in both deception and its detection. Our investigations to date have uncovered disagreements relating to the measurements of such cues, and variations in interpretations, as could be problematic in building a deception detection system.

SNS such as Facebook have grown in popularity in recent years, reaching 1,3 billion monthly active users. However, as this network helps to make the world more open and connected, participants inevitably end up losing control over the extent that their personal information may reach among people that belong to their social circle or not. In this context we present +PrivacyCTRL, a model to enhance privacy controls on SNS, which supports the design of privacy settings in order to give users more autonomy over what they publish in these networks. +PrivacyCTRL was applied  via paper prototype technique  to three well-known SNS and showed promise in clarifying the privacy settings and improving the user's choice about what to reveal and to whom.	social network	Francine Bülow Bergmann;Milene Selbach Silveira	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07620-1_34	public relations;engineering;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-82.917164887346	-17.002761367978362	168650
4260e0fa64b17050b830af1d4fa0ca7d2d1c709e	healthy connections: online social networks and their potential for peer support.		Social and professional support for mental health is lacking in many rural areas - highlighting the need for innovative ways to improve access to services. This study explores the potential of online social networking as an avenue for peer support. Using a cross sectional survey, 74 secondary students answered questions relating to internet use, online social network use and perceptions of mental health support. Over half of the sample had experienced a need for mental health support with 53% of participants turning to the internet. Results indicate that online social networking sites were used regularly by 82% of the sample and 47% believed these sites could help with mental health problems. The study concluded that online social networking sites may be able to link young people together with others in similar situations. The popularity and frequency of use may allow these sites to provide information, advice and direction for those seeking help.

The objective of this study is to examine, if knowledge exploration by IS researchers is linked to the widely debated issue of IS discipline, ‘diversity’. Using knowledge management and innovation literature as the theoretical base, this study empirically evaluates the relationship between knowledge exploration and diversity at the disciplinary level. One hundred articles over a period of four years (2000-2004), from MISQ, which is one of the leading academic IS journals were examined to investigate this relationship. Exploration was measured by examining the citation pattern of these articles. Diversity of IS discipline was measured based on the heterogeneity of the research method, research topic and levels of analyses. Results show that knowledge exploration by IS researchers is positively related to the discipline’s diversity in research topics and research methods, but not in levels of analyses. Having confirmed the positive relationship between knowledge exploration and diversity, this study highlights the importance for IS researchers to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation, to enjoy the benefits of diversity as well as establish a cumulative disciplinary tradition. This study also contributes to the IS literature by identifying the latest trends and potential gaps of the research topics and methods used by IS researchers.	exploit (computer security);information system;knowledge management;management information systems quarterly	Annapoornima M.

This interesting question, which has several relevant implications, has been approached mostly in a more subjective way. Recent concepts and methods from network science are used in the current work in order to develop a more principled, quantitative and objective approach to quantifying the integration and centrality of more theoretical/applied journals within the APS journals database, represented as a directed and undirected citation network. The results suggest a level of integration between more theoretical and applied journals, which are also characterized by remarkably similar centralities in the network.	centrality;citation network;graph (discrete mathematics);network science	Henrique Ferraz de Arruda;Cesar H.

Also considered are differences in self-efficacy, intolerance of uncertainty, and external locus of control scores reliant upon sources selected initially during a search process. Two main research questions were the focus of this study. First, what types of information sources do undergraduates tend to use first during an everyday-life or course-related search, and is context important? Second, do certain user characteristics influence the selection of the first source selected during information searches? A series of chi square and one tailed t tests were performed to examine these research questions in depth. The overarching goal of this research is to use these results to better understand and structure information services for undergraduates.	chi;locus;poo-chi	Rachel D.

3231ca5d2d4be3ccca1330cb7d4b3beb932fba94	an evaluation of collaborative research in a college of engineering	exponential random graph models ergms;collaborative networks;social network analysis;self reported data	A frequently used measure of scientific (or research) collaboration is co-authorship in scholarly publications. Less frequently used are joint grant proposals and patents. Many scholars believe that the use of co-authorship as the sole measure of research collaboration is insufficient because collaboration between researchers might not result in co-authorship. Collaborations involve informal communication (i.e., conversational exchange) between researchers. Using self-reports from 100 tenured/tenure-track faculty in the College of Engineering at the University of South Florida, researchers’ networks are constructed from their communication relationships and also from collaborations in three areas: joint publications, joint grant proposals, and joint patents. The data collection: (1) covers both researchers’ in-progress and completed collaborative outputs, (2) yields a rating from the researchers on the importance of a relationship to them and (3) obtains multiple types of relationship ties between researchers allowing for the comparison of multiple networks. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) results show that the more communication researchers have the more likely they produce collaborative outputs. Furthermore, we find that joint grant proposals tend to have mixed gender teams and that researchers of the same race are more likely to publish together, but those demographic attributes have no additional explanatory power regarding joint patents. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

If any of this content is worthy of preservation, who decides what is to be preserved and based on what criteria. This paper explores the potential for public libraries to assume this role of community digital repositories through the creation of digital collections. Thirty public library users and thirty librarians were solicited from the Indianapolis metropolitan area to evaluate five images selected from Flickr in terms of their value to public library digital collections and their worthiness of long-term preservation. Using a seven-point Likert scale, participants assigned a value to each image in terms of its importance to self, family and society. Participants were then asked to explain the reasoning behind their valuations. Public library users and librarians had similar value estimations of the images in the study. This is perhaps the most significant finding of the study, given the importance of collaboration and forming partnerships for building and sustaining community collections and archives.	archive;case preservation;digital image;flickr;librarian;library (computing);privacy;public library	Andrea J.

The study explored the impact of gender and family background on the Entrepreneurial Attitude Orientation (EAO). This study showed that a significant difference exists between male and female trainees on achievement motivation. However, no significant differences were noted between male and female subjects in terms of innovation, personal control and self-esteem. Interestingly, service background trainees scored comparatively higher on achievement, locus of control and self-esteem. Gender and background factors also interacted significantly in determining one’s EAO.	cognition;data descriptor;locus	Jan de Leede;Jan C. Looise;Ben C. M.

This paper presents an analysis of recent retraction patterns, with a unique emphasis on the role author self-cites play, to assist the scientific community in creating counter-strategies. This was accomplished by examining the following: (1) A categorization of retracted articles more complete than previously published work. (2) The relationship between citation counts and after-retraction self-cites from the authors of the work, and the distribution of self-cites across our retraction categories. (3) The distribution of retractions written by both the author and the editor across our retraction categories. (4) The trends for seven of our nine defined retraction categories over a 6-year period. (5) The average journal impact factor by category, and the relationship between impact factor, author self-cites, and overall citations. Our findings indicate new reasons for retractions have emerged in recent years, and more editors are penning retractions. The rates of increase for retraction varies by category, and there is statistically significant difference of average impact factor between many categories. 18 % of authors self-cite retracted work post retraction with only 10 % of those authors also citing the retraction notice. Further, there is a positive correlation between self-cites and after retraction citations.	categories;categorization;citation network;dental retraction (procedure);heart rate variability;journal citation reports;scientific publication;statistical significance;timeline fluoride releasing resin;negative resolution <retracted>	Charisse R.

The advances in online social networks now allow individuals to change attitudes and behaviors on a mass scale. MIP has six components: persuasive experience, automated structure, social distribution, rapid cycle, huge social graph, and measured impact. Before the launch of Facebook Platform, these six components had never come together in one system. As tools for creating MIP become available to ordinary people, individuals and small groups can better reach and persuade masses. This new phenomenon will change the future of persuasion.	facebook platform;social graph;social network	B. J.

A fundamental question that has not been fully addressed is how censorship is perceived by people who experience it. A person may exhibit pro- or anti-censorship attitudes, but it is possible that (s)he may not even be aware of its existence. In this study, we report results of a large-scale survey on Chinese Internet users' experiences with Internet censorship. The results show that users' demographic backgrounds, Internet usage experience, and personality influence their attitudes toward censorship. Those who score high on authoritarian personality measures tend to support censorship. Attitudes toward censorship change so that over time it is viewed as more normal, which suggests a “normalization” process. We discuss how these findings can generalize beyond the Chinese context to other societies in which Internet censorship can exist.	database normalization;internet;self-censorship	Dakuo Wang;Gloria Mark	2015	ACM Trans.

2628efc75a6c2efc79735509f59efb50222f8f06	towards a definition of serendipity in information behaviour	discovery processes;behavior;information seeking;models	Introduction. Serendipitous or accidental discovery of information has often been neglected in information behaviour models, which tend to focus on information seeking, a more goal-directed behaviour. Method. This theoretical paper seeks to map the conceptual space of serendipity in information behaviour and to arrive at a definition. This is done through carrying out a literature review on information behaviour and serendipity and defining relevant terms in the area. Using Wilson’s framework as a starting point, a series of frameworks is arrived at to include serendipity in information behaviour models. Analysis. The terms used in this research space were investigated, as well as the times when serendipitous finding can occur, the dimensions of serendipitous findings, and a series of assumptions to draw out the key elements of serendipity. Results. The results of the analysis is a framework of continuums that identifies the core of this research area of serendipity in information behaviour and arrives at its definition. Conclusions. By including serendipity in information behaviour models, the frameworks arrived at should help further research in this area. A working definition of serendipity in information behaviour is a starting point for other researchers to investigate related questions in the area.	behavioral modeling;definition;error-tolerant design;information seeking;recommender system;the times	Naresh Kumar Agarwal	2015	Inf.

837854b8bf1ac6bc65a44e2316fc9e29c6fc69e7	scholarly book publishers in spain: relationship between size, price, specialization and prestige		Introduction The prestige of book publishers is an important element for the assessment of SSH scholars in Spain. Until 2012, that ‘prestige’ remained based upon subjective, individual judgements from assessment committees’ members. In order to provide a more objective reference for the prestige of book publishers, ÍLIA research group developed a ranking of book publishers (so called SPI) based on the opinion of almost three thousand experts from all SSH fields (Giménez-Toledo et al.., 2013). Nevertheless, the factors underlying the perceived prestige are unknown. Some authors worked on the influence of marketing on the perception of books. Squires (2007) point out that ‘we should not underestimate the value or efficiency that the association with an specific publisher provides to its contents’. It is hypothesized that three factors (among others) might be related to the perceived prestige: size of the book publisher (number of titles published), specialization (share of titles in each discipline) and price of the books.	book;partial template specialization	Jorge Mañana-Rodríguez;Elea Giménez-Toledo	2015			public relations;competitor analysis;prestige;ranking;history;economic geography;publishing;publication	HCI	-78.14864767670193	-21.368074109872868	177081

The basic problematic of the current research is as follows: although scientific production and cooperation has gained a strategic importance and bibliometric studies have become popular on scientific production processes with reference to the number of academic publications and citations, academic studies on this field have not been carried out yet in Turkish language speaking countries. In the current study, a bibliometric analysis was done with reference to co-authored scientific documents and citations between 2000 and 2016 years in the countries being a member of “Turkic Council” which is one of the main international organizations aiming to institutionalize scientific cooperation in Turkic world. In the analyses obtained from Web of Science, the following phenomena were highlighted the number of academic documents, the number of citations, the number of academic documents per academic staff, the number of academic documents per institutions, the impact factors of the studies, the main research fields, the number of co-authored academic studies which the member countries carried out together and with the other countries and finally the languages used in these academic studies. The basic research question in the present research focuses on what kind of evolution appeared in the number of academic documents, their impact factors, co-authoring matter and their main research fields in Turkic Council member countries. The essential findings of this interdisciplinary study in which scientific research statistics of the member countries are presented in analyses along with geopolitical descriptions can be listed as follows; Turkey is the main research partner of Turkic Council member countries, Turkey has still kept its preliminary role in the process of scientific cooperation in Turkic world together with the end of the cold war, the other member countries except for Turkey have fallen behind considerably in the rank of publication and citation performance, the scientific cooperation among other member countries has not been activated yet despite the institutional moves of the Council, the use of Turkish language in the examined documents is rather scarce although Turkey occupies the scientific preliminary position and the Council is an international organization which is shaped under the framework of common language axis.	apache axis;bibliometrics;document;web of science	Köksal Sahin;Gökçe Candan	2018	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-018-2730-x	turkish;data mining;bibliometrics;citation;scientific method;research question;computer science;geopolitics;social science	DB	-77.87880889454122	-21.963707266002167	177237

Since academic weblogs tend to be used by scholars to position themselves in a disciplinary blogging community, links are essential to their construction. The aim of this article is to analyze the reasons for linking in academic weblogs and to determine how links are used for distribution of information, collaborative construction of knowledge, and construction of the blog's and the blogger's identity. For this purpose I analyzed types of links in 15 academic blogs, considering both sidebar links and in-post links. The results show that links are strategically used by academic bloggers for several purposes, among others to seek their place in a disciplinary community, to engage in hypertext conversations for collaborative construction of knowledge, to organize information in the blog, to publicize their research, to enhance the blog's visibility, and to optimize blog entries and the blog itself. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Given the volume of contributions, which are likely to be seen? While previous work has focused on content, we examine the relationship between communication tactics and prominence. We study three communities, comparing front-page reviews versus those on latter pages. We consider 3 types of devices: structural features, textual features, and persuasive writing. Structural features, such as profiles, convey information about authors. Textual properties, such as punctuation use, can make an impression on others. Rhetorical writing strategies are used by reviewers to convince readers of their opinions. When controlling for content, the most salient tactics distinguishing prominent reviews are textual properties and persuasive language.		Jahna Otterbacher	2011	J.

Country risk has traditionally been assessed by monitoring economic and financial indicators. However, social media (such as forums, blogs, and websites) are now important transporters of citizens' daily conversations and opinions, and as such may carry discernible indicators of risk, but they have been as yet little-used for this task. The Geopolitical Web project is a research effort with the ultimate goal of developing computational approaches for monitoring public opinion in regions of conflict, assessing country risk indicators in the social media of fragile or weakening states, and correlating these risk signals with commonly accepted quantitative geopolitical risk assessments. This paper presents the initial motivation for this data-driven project, collection procedures adopted, preliminary results of an automated topical analysis of the collection's content, and expected future work. By catching and deciphering possible signals of country risk in social discourse we hope to offer the international community an additional means of assessing the need for intervention in or support for fragile or weakening states.	blog;risk assessment;social media;web project	Hsinchun Chen;Catherine A.

This study examines the usage of design attributes between Australian, Chinese, and Saudi Arabian cultures. This study used automated and manual techniques to investigate design attributes including layout, navigation, links, multimedia, visual representation, colour, and text. Significant differences were found in each of the listed design attributes, suggesting that different interfaces may be needed for successful communication with different cultural groups. The results of this study confirm and extend prior research and anthropological models. The contribution of this study is the scale (460 websites in total) and breadth (seven design attributes) of the research. It also provides revised insights into culture and website design and the concept of cultural translation of web content.

This change is usually discussed from a more epistemological viewpoint. In order to enhance the understanding of the underlying key factors, bibliometric, demographic and Nobel Prize recipient data spanning of the last hundred years are considered and analyzed. It is found that in general the considered data point to a quasi-steady state in bibliometric developments of highly developed countries. For emerging countries, such a steady state is not yet attained; therefore, the research output in scientific journal articles is still expected to rise considerably. Consequences and interpretations of an ever growing research output in relation to the increasing age of Nobel Prize recipients are discussed and conclusions are drawn from the considered data.	bibliometrics;bremermann's limit;data point;file spanning;population;scientometrics;steady state	Chung-Souk Han;Su Kyung Lee;Mark England	2009	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-009-0119-6	innovation;social science;developing country;philosophy;epistemology;sociology;steady state theory;steady state;operations research;economic growth	NLP	-77.5674535933994	-19.84504259921452	179027

Notwithstanding its well-known strengths and limits, it is still widely misused as a tool for evaluation, well beyond the purposes it was intended for. In order to shed further light on its nature, the present work studies how the correlation between the Journal Impact Factor and the (time-weighed) article Mean Received Citations (intended as a measure of journal performance) has evolved through time. It focuses on a sample of hard sciences and social sciences journals from the 1999 to 2010 time period. Correlation coefficients (Pearson’s Coefficients as well as Spearman’s Coefficients and Kendall’s ) are calculated and then tested against several null hypotheses. The results show that in most cases Journal Impact Factors and their yearly variations do not display a strong correlation with citedness. Differences also exist among scientific areas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	bibliometrics;coefficient;experiment;hard coding	Ugo Finardi	2013	J.

[14] examined diffusion data from Twitter to conclude that online petitions are shared more virally than other types of content. Their definition of structural virality, which measures the extent to which diffusion follows a broadcast model or is spread person to person (virally), depends on knowing the topology of the diffusion cascade. But often the diffusion structure cannot be observed directly. We examined time-stamped signature data from the Obama White House’s We the People petition platform. We developed measures based on temporal dynamics that, we argue, can be used to infer diffusion structure as well as the more intrinsic notion of virality sometimes known as infectiousness. These measures indicate that successful petitions are likely to be higher in both intrinsic and structural virality than unsuccessful petitions are. We also investigate threshold effects on petition signing that challenge simple contagion models, and report simulations for a theoretical model that are consistent with our data.	computer simulation;online petition	Chi Ling Chan;Justin Lai;Bryan Hooi;Todd R.

A text-mining application based on the constructs of coordination theory was developed to measure the coordinative activity of each employee. Results show that high network centrality is correlated with the ability of an actor to coordinate actions of others in a project group. Furthermore, highly centralised actors coordinate better than others. In conclusion, we suggest implications of appropriate network structure for supporting organisational coordination more effectively and efficiently.	actor model;centralisation;centrality;text mining	Liaquat Hossain;Andrè Wu;Kon Shing Kenneth Chung	2006		10.1145/1180875.1180930	text mining;social science;content analysis;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;sociology;social network	HCI	-79.88993413389719	-17.657657239968596	179759

SNSs have caused a new way of interaction among people. In this respect, it is important to understand the SNSs users' activities and also it is substantial to explain the main reasons behind the SNSs usage. This paper investigates key factors determining social network site usage and characteristics of SNSs users. A sample of 1393 SNSs users from Izmir which is the third biggest city of Turkey were surveyed. Results revealed that there are seven factors - business oriented, create, socializing, entertainment, status seeking, communication, and information seeking - behind the SNSs usage motivation. Besides this, cluster analysis has been conducted to explore the SNSs users’ characteristics and four groups - advanced users, business-oriented users, communication seekers, and dawdlers - were identified. Additional analyses conceived that people in different clusters show contrasts about their SNSs usage motivations and these differences are statistically significant. Motives behind SNS usage, clusters with their characteristics and differences among clusters are discussed.	abcd schema;biological anthropology;social network	Zeki Atil Bulut;Onur Dogan	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2016.10.021	computer science;multimedia;cluster analysis;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-84.28676561285036	-17.162484805422757	179823

We use a psychometric instrument to extract six mood states (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) from the aggregated Twitter content and compute a six-dimensional mood vector for each day in the timeline. We compare our results to a record of popular events gathered from media and sources. We find that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have a significant, immediate and highly specific effect on the various dimensions of public mood. We speculate that large scale analyses of mood can provide a solid platform to model collective emotive trends in terms of their predictive value with regards to existing social as well as economic indicators.	sentiment analysis;timeline;vigor (software)	Johan Bollen;Alberto Pepe;Huina Mao	2011	CoRR		public relations;social media;computer science;popular culture;economic indicator;advertising;political culture;social psychology;law;world wide web;sentiment analysis	Web+IR	-82.43073221360802	-17.688939296657974	180052

Both are similar power-law functions. In an earlier work (1992) the authors developed an information theoretic model for Zipf s law based on the classical Shannon theory. A newer version, based on algorithmic information theory, was proposed in 1996. These two models are now extended to Bradford's law. The meaning of a discourse, ignored in Shannon's theory, is given special significance in the algorithmic information theory for language discourses and Zipf's law is shown to be a consequence of an optimum meaningpreserving code of the discourse. Such a code exhibits characteristics of complex adaptive systems a mixture of elements of order and randomness. A complexity function was defined for a discourse, which is maximum for a state intermediate between order and disorder, and it was shown that it is nearly maximal for natural discourses. A general discussion of power law distributions reveals the uniqueness of Zipf's law as the only one associated with an optimal meaning-preserving code. Power laws are a natural consequence of scale invariance; an elementary mathematical treatment is presented. Functions more complicated than a simple power law also show scale invariance and one such function may in fact conform to some observations. Some general comments about the nature of scientific laws conclude with a suggestion that Zipf's law may indeed qualify for the title 'mathematical law'.	algorithmic information theory;bradford's law;complex adaptive system;complexity function;information science;informetrics;maximal set;randomness;shannon (unit);zipf's law	S.

This exploratory study uses Twitter as a lens for examining gratitude for support provisions in the aftermath of disasters. Gratitude for support is examined in the context of two major disasters in the United States, the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and a May 2011 tornado that devastated Alabama. Analyzing tweets from these communities after each disaster, we identified and described six categories of support exchanged through Twitter. We found distinct difference in expressions of gratitude for different types of social support in these two communities. While some of these differences could be expected based on the nature of the disaster, others were less predictable. These findings suggest that social media has value as a window into real-time community behaviors relating to response and healing after disaster, and may offer potential for monitoring community resilience and recovery, and provide insights for disaster mental health provision.	half-life 2: episode one;real-time clock;social media;social support;tornado;triangulation (geometry)	Kimberly Glasgow;Clayton Fink;Jessica Vitak;Yla R.

This paper elaborates on this approach to characterize the performance of an institution as guarantor based not only on its guarantor output but also on the importance of the institutions with which it collaborates. Accepting that guarantorship implies in some way acknowledgement of a prominent role on the part of the collaborating institutions, and that this recognition will be more important the more important the collaborating institutions, the paper describes two approaches to measuring this acknowledgement and discusses their effectiveness in helping to recognize prominent scientific actors by using a case study in the Library and Information Science field. The results show a high assortativity in scientific collaboration relationships, confirming the original hypothesis that important institutions tend to grant prestigious institutions the recognition of their relevance.

In this paper we describe an experience in which a group of students worked to identify a group of people from partial data that had been stripped of any direct identifiers, such as name or identification number. The students were successful in the assigned task, and as an indirect consequence, there was an increase of interest in the topic of privacy. With the partial evidence collected from this case, we argue that a hands-on, exercise-solving approach could be adapted to communicate privacy issues more effectively.	internet privacy	Luis Gustavo Esquivel-Quirós;Elena Gabriela Barrantes	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-41763-9_4	privacy by design;knowledge management;political science;management science;social psychology	ECom	-84.50095557419759	-17.98930283521351	182630

They utilize publication records of more than 200,000 scholarly journal articles, together with affiliations of the authors to infer distance collaborations. The longevity of their study is of interest because it covers several years before and after the birth of the Internet and computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) technologies. Thus, they provide one lens through which the impact of computer-assisted collaborative work technologies can be viewed. Their results show that there has been a steady and constant growth in the frequency of both interinstitute and crosscountry collaborations in a particular physics domain, regardless of the introduction of these technologies. This suggests that we are witnessing an evolution, rather than a revolution, with respect to long-distance collaborative behavior. An interdisciplinary approach, combining numerical statistics, graph visualizations, and social network measurements, facilitates their remarks on the changes in the size and structure of these collaborations over this period of history. Introduction Research is a social process involving the dissemination and review of documents, the exchange of ideas and expertise , the shared viewing and interpretation of events, and other collaborative information intensive activities. It is clear that recent technologies provide alternate avenues for participating in these social activities remotely, evident by e-print archives for disseminating articles rapidly and widely, virtual collaboratories for exchanging ideas, video conferenc-ing, and other computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies. To best design related tools for the future, it is important to understand the evolution of collaborative behavior. Did the availability of the Internet or tools for virtual collaboration change the frequency or structure of remote collaborations? Our motivation for this work began with an intuition that these tools impacted the frequency of long-distance research collaborations considerably. In this work, we test that intuition by utilizing publication records together with institute affiliations of authors to infer distance collaborations among a community of physicists. Our approach is to study the frequency and structure of remote collaborations before and after the emergence of the Internet and computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) and CMC related technologies. We include and interpret our findings, revealing a constant and steady increase in the number of collaborations throughout the entire 30-year period. Rather than having a revolutionary effect, which may be witnessed by a change in the evolutionary trend, CSCW and the Internet appear to have enabled the evolution to continue smoothly, as is …	archive;computer-mediated communication;computer-supported cooperative work;document;emergence;internet;knowledge spillover;numerical analysis;smoothing;social network	Lori Lorigo;Fabio Pellacini	2007	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20638	social science;computer science;information mapping;evolution;operations research;world wide web;computer-mediated communication;social network;collaboration	HCI	-77.43288580681221	-17.856263286983683	183090

Despite the increasing desire to analyze the career of newcomers, however, the outcomes of different collaboration patterns between advisors and advisees remain unknown. The purpose of this paper is to find out the correlation between advisors’ academic characteristics and advisees’ academic performance in Computer Science. Employing both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we find that with the increase of advisors’ academic age, advisees’ performance experiences an initial growth, follows a sustaining stage, and finally ends up with a declining trend. We also discover the phenomenon that accomplished advisors can bring up skilled advisees. We explore the conclusion from two aspects: (1) Advisees mentored by advisors with high academic level have better academic performance than the rest; (2) Advisors with high academic level can raise their advisees’ h-index ranking. This work provides new insights on promoting our understanding of the relationship between advisors’ academic characteristics and advisees’ performance, as well as on advisor choosing.	computer science;experience;futures studies;universality probability	Jiaying Liu;Tao Tang;Xiangjie Kong;Amr Tolba;Zafer Al-makhadmeh;Feng Xia	2018	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-018-2762-2	knowledge management;data mining;social network analysis;computer science;phenomenon	Metrics	-79.45377341534663	-19.90149033078596	183303

At the moment, evaluative frameworks are in short supply for institutional and disciplinary repositories (Kim u0026 Kim, 2006). After a review of issues of scholars participating in digital repositories, author/depositor distribution is analyzed as one possible technique that might be used to judge the success of a repository. This statistical technique was used to evaluate participation patterns among more than 30,000 author/depositors whose works were found in various categories of digital repositories. Findings from this analysis, including comparisons of participation patterns across three categories of scholarly repositories, are presented along with an explanation of the questions and challenges that arose during the study. The article concludes with an evaluation of the analytical technique and its potential as one metric for judging a repositoryu0027s success.		Chuck Thomas;Robert H.

The results demonstrate that the core-scatter distribution of cited authors, institutions, and journals varies for authors in each impact and productivity class. All authors in the science network receive the majority of their credit from high-impact authors; however, this effect decreases as authors’ impact levels decrease. Similarly, the proportion of citations that lower-impact authors make to each other increases as authors’ impact levels decrease. High-impact authors, who have the highest degree of membership in the science network, publish fewer papers in comparison to highly productive authors. However, authors with the highest impact make both more references per paper and also more citations to papers in the science network. This suggests that high-impact authors produce the most relevant work in the science network. Comparing practices by productivity level, authors receive the majority of their credit from highly productive authors and authors cite highly productive authors more frequently than less productive authors.	scientific literature	Ali Gazni;Zahra Ghaseminik	2016	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23580	computer science;operations research;citation analysis;world wide web	HPC	-78.23411514462174	-21.533769274093725	184989
41cc77d1dcc026acfd2ee1b972968501870d324f	reopening the black box of career age and research performance		Prior studies have a debate on whether research performance will be affected by age. Some researchers suggest that scientist’s career age will positively affect research performance. For instance, for senior faculty with the later career years, their publications only slightly decline than highly productive faculty members, suggesting the statement of “Matthew effect” in science. In contrast, some studies point out that research productivity will decline with age, showing “a loss of vigor” in scientific research. This research question is still remain unanswered. The purpose of this study is to reexamine this association between career age and research performance, measured by number of publications, top-tier publications, and the h-index. The empirical study was conducted on a sample of 137 scholars from the Web of Knowledge. The results indicate that the relationship between career age and research performance is not a linear, nearly an inverted U-shaped curve.	black box	Chien Hsiang Liao	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58536-9_41	psychology;management;social psychology	HPC	-78.53094959450314	-21.13598497338285	186175

The content analysis of the postings correlates survivors’ expressed information needs, barriers, and resource preferences during the three basic stages of crisis. As funding for crisis centers disappears and IPV survivor needs increase, librarians can help to save lives by adjusting services to enhance privacy, safety, and confidentiality.	computer security;confidentiality;documentation;embedded system;experience;information needs;interaction;journal of the association for information science and technology;librarian;library (computing);library and information science;list of information schools;personally identifiable information;population	Lynn Westbrook;Maria E.

Using data drawn from Australian services, this article provides a new methodology for charting when usage occurs, and to what extent a difference exists between various sectors of the community. It also demonstrates the suitability of human activity patterns and time usage studies to understand how society adopts new technologies.		Dirk H. R. Spennemann	2006	Inf.

Ostomates explain that they appreciate contact with others who can relate to their experiences and are concerned with where to get advice and support about their ostomies. Internet communities are one outlet to challenge stigma and find support, and the web site Uncover Ostomy is one such community. The web site is the work of Jessica Grossman, a college student who challenges ostomy stigma through provocative photos. Through the associated Facebook fan page, users upload their own photos uncovering their ostomies. This project examined uploaded photos to see how people challenge stigma using new media technology. Additionally, the project examined comments left by Facebook users to understand how the ostomy community reacted to these photos. Implications of such spaces for users to challenge a stigmatizing condition are discussed.		Dennis O.

Numerous examples of research quality assessment can be named as products of innovation and incremental change (Barker, 2007; Hicks, 2012; RDI Council, 2013). An overview of assessment methods applied in Eastern European countries in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities has recently been presented (Pajic, 2015), but information about Lithuanian assessment of research is lacking. Here, we analyse seven sequential Lithuanian methods of research assessment in the period 2005–2015, their influence and consequences.

Prior research has established that these apps mostly do not support the theoretical 'habit' construct defined in psychology, yet are generally popular and well reviewed in app stores. This apparent mismatch between theory and 'in-the-wild' usage has not been investigated to date. Through an in-depth qualitative study of a popular application Lift, this research establishes that common techniques such as reminders and streaks are effective at supporting repetition of new behaviors, but at the same time create a dependency: on-going app use is often required to achieve lasting change. This dependency introduces fragility in users' attempts to change their behavior, as they often abandon the app and subsequently disengage with their new behaviors.	expectation propagation	Ian Renfree;Daniel Harrison;Paul Marshall;Katarzyna Stawarz;Anna Louise Cox	2016		10.1145/2851581.2892495	simulation;habit;behavior change	HCI	-84.3816767362356	-20.80237040049784	192461

Scientific advances are made, but is the population aware? Allow the population to understand the scientific advances of a disease, achievements made and current risk situation is important to avoid panic, prejudice and violence. This work aims to study the impact of the main Zika researchers and the repercussion of their research on population. For this purpose, the main researchers were identified in co-authorship networks and, through altmetric indexes (alternative metrics), the repercussion of these researchers were analyzed in news and social media.	altmetrics;population;social media;social network analysis	Luís Fernando Monsores Passos Maia;Jonice Oliveira	2017		10.1145/3126858.3131593	multimedia;zika virus;internet privacy;social network analysis;rdf;world wide web;computer science;prejudice (legal term);social media;altmetrics;population	HCI	-80.49271040818171	-18.963532651286688	193070
c714366b62536822ad27b87283b4764403c5d807	mixed-effects design analysis for experimental phonetics		Abstract It is common practice in the statistical analysis of phonetic data to draw conclusions on the basis of statistical significance. While p -values reflect the probability of incorrectly concluding a null effect is real, they do not provide information about other types of error that are also important for interpreting statistical results. In this paper, we focus on three measures related to these errors. The first, power , reflects the likelihood of detecting an effect that in fact exists. The second and third, Type M and Type S errors, measure the extent to which estimates of the magnitude and direction of an effect are inaccurate. We then provide an example of design analysis ( Gelman u0026 Carlin, 2014 ), using data from an experimental study on German incomplete neutralization, to illustrate how power, magnitude, and sign errors vary with sample and effect size. This case study shows how the informativity of research findings can vary substantially in ways that are not always, or even usually, apparent on the basis of a p -value alone. We conclude by repeating three recommendations for good statistical practice in phonetics from best practices widely recommended for the social and behavioral sciences: report all results; design studies which will produce high-precision estimates; and conduct direct replications of previous findings.

1b8ef0006775024b989712370ec2f8404ecadeb4	facebook and academic performance: reconciling a media sensation with data		A recent draft manuscript suggested that Facebook use might be related to lower academic achievement in college and graduate school (Karpinski, 2009). The report quickly became a media sensation and was picked up by hundreds of news outlets in a matter of days. However, the results were based on correlational data in a draft manuscript that had not been published, or even considered for publication. This paper attempts to replicate the results reported in the press release using three data sets: one with a large sample of undergraduate students from the University of Illinois at Chicago, another with a nationally representative cross sectional sample of American 14- to 22-year-olds, as well as a longitudinal panel of American youth aged 14-23. In none of the samples do we find a robust negative relationship between Facebook use and grades. Indeed, if anything, Facebook use is more common among individuals with higher grades. We also examined how changes in academic performance in the nationally representative sample related to Facebook use and found that Facebook users were no different from non-users.

The Huffington Post took a pro-active stance when they introduced badges that award users for the frequency of their posting behaviors. Both social role and network theories posit that groups create their own normative structures when left to grow organically. However, badges may be symbolic of hierarchical control since they are defined, determined, and awarded by the organization rather than from the group itself. This study is a first step in examining the relationship between badges and group behavior within threads. As active members of the group, badge owners may be serving the role of discussion catalysts [1]. If so, then threads started by badge owners should be longer than for non-badge owners. Preferential attachment posits that highly connected users are """"richer"""" in the social network [2]. Thus, threads started by badge owners may draw in more badge owners to the discussion. If badges have no influence on thread characteristics, then what does? Findings suggest that badges at the thread start do not generate longer threads but rather the type of news story does. Furthermore, some of the most popular commenters were not badge owners despite the overwhelming number of fans they had attracted. This study takes a first look at how parameters set by news organizations are accepted, or rejected, by online communities"""	attachments;online community;social network;theory	Julie Jones;Nathan Altadonna	2012		10.1145/2145204.2145244	network theory;psychology;social science;journalism;sociology;communication;social psychology;world wide web;group dynamics;social network	Web+IR	-82.63401737672763	-17.249948335376935	195896
8496c702354a9f6c7b49b8e85666a342d790bd3f	citation distribution of individual scientist: approximations of stretch exponential distribution with power law tails		A multi-parametric family of stretch exponential distributions with various power law tails is introduced and is shown to describe adequately the empirical distributions of scientific citation of individual authors. The fourparametric families are characterized by a normalization coefficient in the exponential part, the power exponent in the power-law asymptotic part, and the coefficient for the transition between the above two parts. The distribution of papers of individual scientist over citations of these papers is studied. Scientists are selected via total number of citations in three ranges: 10 2 -10 3 , 10 3 -10 4 , and 10 4 -10 5 of total citations. We study these intervals for physicists in ISI Web of Knowledge. The scientists who started their scientific publications after 1980 were taken into consideration only. It is detected that the power coefficient in the stretch exponent starts from one for low-cited authors and has to trend to smaller values for scientists with large number of citation. At the same time, the power coefficient in tail drops for large-cited authors. One possible explanation for the origin of the stretch-exponential distribution for citation of individual author is done.	approximation;coefficient;ibm 7030 stretch;power glove;scientific citation;scientific literature;tails;time complexity;web of science	Ol.

However, it is challenging to design the VMS messages since the population possess different cultural, linguistic, and social backgrounds. To aid in the process of VMS design, this paper presents results from a questionnaire survey, conducted on chauffeurs involved in crashes in the Kingdom to understand their knowledge of traffic signs. A sample of around 800 chauffeurs, who were involved in crashes, was collected by conducting personal interviews. The relationship between chauffeurs’ demographic characteristics, such as nationality, age group, language skills, and knowledge of traffic signs were assessed. The chauffeurs’ language skills were assessed for Arabic, English, and native language. Chauffeurs’ knowledge of five traffic signs namely speed limit, no entry, no overtaking, stop sign, and roundabout were tested. The results from descriptive analysis indicated that more than 60% drivers were able to understand traffic signs written in Arabic and English language. The least understood sign was no entry and the most understood sign was stop sign. Nationality of chauffeur was related to the knowledge of traffic signs and language skills. These results suggest that more research should be undertaken before designing VMS especially in a heterogeneous driver population like that of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.		Wael K. M.

The ASN is meant to attest that an individual has reached a suitable level of scientific maturity to apply for professorship positions. A five member panel, appointed for each scientific discipline, is in charge of evaluating applicants by means of quantitative indicators of impact and productivity, and through an assessment of their research profile. Many concerns were raised on the appropriateness of the evaluation criteria, and in particular on the use of bibliometrics for the evaluation of individual researchers. Additional concerns were related to the perceived poor quality of the final evaluation reports. In this paper we assess the ASN in terms of appropriateness of the applied methodology, and the quality of the feedback provided to the applicants. We argue that the ASN is not fully compliant with the best practices for the use of bibliometric indicators for the evaluation of individual researchers; moreover, the quality of final reports varies considerably across the panels, suggesting that measures should be put in place to prevent sloppy practices in future ASN rounds.	best practice;bibliometrics;capability maturity model;norm (social);report;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Moreno Marzolla	2016	J.

Research indicates that virtual worlds may help this group to gain independence and improve social participation. The aim of the present research was to explore the role that virtual worlds play in facilitating people with disability to experience a self-perceived improvement of social participation, independence and well-being. Using qualitative methods our results indicate that people with lifelong disability perceive that they reach a larger and more diverse network through the use of virtual worlds. Based on identified Quality of Life factors, we found that people with lifelong disability perceived that they obtained increased independence, social participation and well-being. The social affordances offered by virtual worlds are promising for improving these identified factors. This area of research warrants further empirical investigation to understand the implications in a broader social context.	social affordance;virtual world	Karen Stendal;Judith Molka-Danielsen;Bjørn Erik Munkvold;Susan Balandin	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.485	quality of life;computer science;knowledge management;socioeconomics;virtual reality;multimedia;law;information technology	HCI	-84.40018495498232	-21.79038637429219	197774

Specifically, we explored 1) why MTurk workers self-organize into online communities (Turker communities), and 2) how the workers' self-organization impacts the requesters and 3) the workers. In the first study, we conducted a field experiment by advertising the same survey tasks on both MTurk and on Turker communities. In the second study, we interviewed two founders of the Turker communities. The results suggest that 1) workers' main motivation to participate in communities is to """"find good HITs"""". 2) For requesters, there is no indication of differences in work quality between the tasks posted on MTurk and the ones advertised on Turker communities. 3) For workers, participation in Turker communities is associated with higher income, controlled for working hours. We also learned from the interviews about why founders built the communities and their future plans."""	amazon mechanical turk;crowdsourcing;online community;self-organization;the turk	Xinyi Wang;Haiyi Zhu;Yangyun Li;Yu Cui;Joseph A.

ISI convention allows only the retrieval of papers that cite works of which the author is first or sole author. Non-primary authors (authors whose name appear in second or later position) will not be counted when assembling a cocitation frequency matrix. Therefore, this has been a methodological issue in ACA study. This paper empirically examines the impact of the ISI convention on the results of ACA. Previous research has addressed and shed light on some parts of methodological issues, but failed to address issues such as to what extent the use of different approach has resulted in different outcomes in terms of actual intellectual structure of a given academic discipline. Using our data and cociation matrix generation systems, we compare the differences in the process and outcomes of using different cocitation matrices. Our study concludes that all author based ACA is better than first author based ACA to capture all influential researchers in a field. It also identifies more research subspecialties. Finally, all Author based ACA and first author based ACA produce little differences in stress values of MDS outputs.
