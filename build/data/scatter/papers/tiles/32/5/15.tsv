We contend that DSR has yet to attain its full potential impact on the development and use of information systems due to gaps in the understanding and application of DSR concepts and methods. This essay aims to help researchers (1) appreciate the levels of artifact abstractions that may be DSR contributions, (2) identify appropriate ways of consuming and producing knowledge when they are preparing journal articles or other scholarly works, (3) understand and position the knowledge contributions of their research projects, and (4) structure a DSR article so that it emphasizes significant contributions to the knowledge base. Our focal contribution is the DSR knowledge contribution framework with two dimensions based on the existing state of knowledge in both the problem and solution domains for the research opportunity under study. In addition, we propose a DSR communication schema with similarities to more conventional publication patterns, but which substitutes the description of the DSR artifact in place of a traditional results section. We evaluate the DSR contribution framework and the DSR communication schema via examinations of DSR exemplar publications.	ansi escape code;focal (programming language);information systems;information system;knowledge base;programming paradigm	Shirley Gregor;Alan R.

00330ecf284ccf48e38826d8ebbd3ab4b88bd130	big data and organizational learning: conceptualizing the link		Organizational learning is key for organizations in creating and enhancing business processes as well as improving decision making to gain competitive advantage. Big data is becoming a source of competitive advantage, productivity growth, agility and innovation for organizations. Harnessing knowledge from big data has the potential to create individual and collective learning within organizations. Conceptualizing the link between big data and organizational learning is thus worth investigating if big data is to contribute to organizational learning. To understand the big data and organizational learning link, the characteristics of big data, the tools associated with big data and how organizations learn needs to be understood. Big data assist organizational learning by using its tools to aid the knowledge conversion process. The characteristics of big data are exhibited through the use of big data tools in the management of knowledge involved in organizational learning.	big data;business process;collective intelligence	John Serbe Marfo;Richard Boateng	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-28883-3_20	organizational learning;knowledge management;management science;social psychology	ML	-78.1755726991653	3.403326628722207	161675

Findings from a longitudinal field study are presented to explore the concept of network effects in more detail. Commonly associated with economics, the concept of network effects can also be used in an organizational context to study adoption dynamics and use patterns when new information and communication technologies are introduced. The analysis of the field study data shows that knowledge repositories exhibit strong network effects, which can complicate the implementation process in multiple ways. The research is based on a single, in‐depth case study. Future research should study the role of network effects in relation to other technologies and organizational contexts.

For organizations, understanding potential threats, educating personnel in security awareness, and establishing and executing security policies are a part of the security culture. Methods of research in information security have been proposed and compared at length, but have not been used to their full extent in organizational level studies. The perceived intrusive nature of information security based studies has been mentioned as a leading cause of lack of research in this area. We considered prior recommendations with regard to information security research and applied them to our own study pertaining to a security risk management (SRM) program at a Fortune 500 firm. We were able to successfully allay many of the concerns that management may have had, and completed the study with positive results. The purpose of this paper is to present the research method that was used successfully. We implemented prior recommendations and modified them to address our research question: What is the impact of perceived CSFs on the perceived effectiveness of an organization's SRM program? Our study included creation of a validated instrument.	information security;primer;risk management;security awareness	Humayun Zafar	2010		10.1145/1940941.1940954	standard of good practice;certified information security manager;critical security studies;itil security management;security management;security through obscurity;security information and event management;security convergence;computer science;security policy;threat;information security;information security standards;risk;role theory;security testing;computer security;information security management	Security	-81.14207883434487	-1.5299198161000636	162686

Crucial for a good corporate culture is a comfortable atmosphere and positive social relationships between the employees. The interactions of the people and groups working in the company define their relationships and are reflected in the company’s social network. Projections of such networks are Enterprise Social Networks which are more and more integrated in companies. These social networks can be a powerful tool to analyse the structure of a company and indicate potential problems. This extended abstract poses research questions to identify and quantify mechanisms that have an impact on the social network of a company to ensure resilience. To address these questions we make assumptions based on real-world observations for a subsequent model.	enterprise social networking;interaction;social network	Valentin Burger;Tobias Hoßfeld;David García;Michael Seufert;Ingo Scholtes;David Hock	2013			environmental resource management;psychological resilience;socio-ecological system;social network;business	AI	-82.42619906717958	0.8942786876958585	163276

13bd8e4ec294dde1ed3b5529767e212cdaa70814	social roles and category use: a study of creativity assessment		We show that social roles alter creativity assessments. Specifically, the two main roles in the innovation process – generator roles for producing new ideas and implementer roles for selecting ideas to pursue – invoke different lay theories about what is creative. Study 1 showed that implementers rated a low novelty version of an idea as more creative than a high novelty version, but generators did the opposite. Study 2 showed that generators rated a low usefulness idea as more creative than a high usefulness idea, but implementers did the opposite. Thus, complementary roles prompted competing perspectives. These findings underscore a new challenge for the social distribution of knowledge-intensive work.	theory	Jennifer S.

It is certainly not unrestrictedly positively seen and even some of its supporters saw a hype in  the development of the last few years, which is fading and is being replaced by a realist view of what is feasible. In the  attempt to gain a proof of success, one bumps into further difficulties since the effects of KM activities are often not easily  or explicitly measurable. It is not clear if this would not have developed as positively when not measures would have been  taken for the development of knowledge management. The goal of this paper is the attempt of a comprehensive explanation of  a new theme which is incorporated in Tacit Knowledge Management (TKM), as well as a proposal for the integration of TKM in  the traditional understanding of knowledge management.  	knowledge management	Franz Lehner	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-78942-0_23	computer science;knowledge management;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;domain knowledge	DB	-77.88789054250955	-0.28931468469142146	164127

However, research has also illustrated that often project teams do not meet their objectives and, moreover, there appears to be limited learning from the experiences of project teams so that the same mistakes and problems are encountered time and again. Drawing upon the work of Zoller and Winter one would anticipate that building a project working capability would depend on formalized processes of learning reviews and documentation of that learning. However, in practice, while such processes are common, they are not considered to be very helpful. Qualitative data presented in this paper supports this. However, the quantitative data suggests an opposite picture. The opposing results from the two different methods are explored in relation to Boland and Tenkasi's notions of perspective-making and perspective-taking. More importantly perhaps the difference in the results from the two sets of data provides an indication that organizations need to emphasize the benefits from project reviews and documentation and explore ways in which the documents produced can be made more useful as boundary objects to encourage the sharing of learning across projects	document;documentation;experience	Sue Newell;Harry Scarbrough;Jacky Swan;Robert D.

This paper provides a conceptual model of the relationships among weblog use, intellectual capital--the cumulative knowledge resources possessed by organizations-and both radical and incremental innovative capabilities. We argue that in enabling the transfer of knowledge, the creation of connections among individuals, and the storage of repositories of knowledge, weblogs have become tools that positively impact the three dimensions of intellectual capital-human, social and organizational capital. We also explain how intellectual capital facets are able to differentially affect two types of innovative capability.	blog	Reza Vaezi;Dusya Vera	2011			individual capital;financial capital;knowledge management;social reproduction;business;commerce;means of production	HCI	-78.56069180515422	3.6819095002855664	165133

The authors focus on two IT capabilities, IT exploration and IT exploitation. On the basis of conceptualisation of the capability lifecycle and a hierarchy of dynamic capabilities, the authors establish a theoretical linkage between lower-order capability and higher-order capability, i.e., IT exploration capability to IT exploitation capability to organisational agility. Using the partial least square approach, the authors empirically test the proposed relationships using data from 289 manufacturers in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong province, People’s Republic of China. The authors’ results suggest the positive effects of IT exploration and exploitation capabilities on customer, operational and partner agilities. In addition, the authors find that IT exploitation capability mediates the relationship between IT exploration capability and organisational agility. On the basis of their findings, implications for theory and practice as well as future research opportunities are discussed.

Drawing from prior turnarounds research, we identify several prominent forms of CEO fit/misfit that are especially germane for troubled firms. In testing our hypotheses, we find substantial support for the fit/refit theory: Troubled companies have substantially better performance to the extent that they replace incumbents who are poorly suited to the conditions at hand, and when they appoint new CEOs who are well matched to those conditions. Further reaffirming the fit/refit model, we find that CEO replacement, per se, has no general effect on the improvement of troubled firms.	refit;succession	Guoli Chen;Donald C.

The use of organizational knowledge is not always a conscious endeavor, and this can lead to the use of knowledge at inappropriate times or in inappropriate ways, particularly under changing conditions. To investigate the potential for ineffectual knowledge use, this study examines how organizational knowledge influences organizational performance when there is a high degree of industry dynamism. Using a sample of 105 U.S. firms from 46 industries, this study finds that industry dynamism moderates the relationship between organizational knowledge and organizational performance. Specifically, higher levels of dynamism weaken the positive effect of organizational knowledge on organizational performance. Implications for researchers and practitioners of this finding are discussed.		James M.

Literature shows that this approach has been informative but rather theoretic as there has been limited work using this approach to handle information problems in organisations. There is a need to develop and test theories to help understand Information Behaviour in organisations in a social science context that gives direct benefits to the organisation. It is useful to view organisations as complex social networks of interactions, where importance is put on the relationships between people in the organisations, as well as on the individual actor. A need exists to evaluate and connect insights from social sciences communities of practice, and complexity theory. This paper explores insights from these theories and develops a conceptual framework for understanding Information Behaviour in organisations. Data collection is in a preliminary stage, reflections and observations, of the researcher and a few participants. The intention is to provoke thoughts along the lines of seeking to use a synergy between theories that can offer different and useful platforms to help better understand the impact of information behaviour on organizational culture.	amiga reflections;computational complexity theory;exploratory testing;information;interaction;social network;synergy	Osemeke Mosindi;Petia Sice	2011	IJTHI	10.4018/jthi.2011040101	organizational culture;social science;organization;knowledge management;management science;sociology;management;social psychology	HCI	-78.81671381473122	-2.5185085398216986	167167

0d06d70415506e3d091b255ef9ffddcba71d2d87	strategic coopetition - a conceptual modeling framework for analysis and design		Coopetition describes a relationship in which two or more actors cooperate and compete simultaneously [1]. It is a counter-intuitive social phenomenon because it is comprised of seemingly antithetical behaviors that are undergirded by contradictory logics, antipodal hypotheses, and diametrical assumptions [2]. However, coopetition is frequently observed within strategic relationships among actors [3] such as partnerships, joint ventures, alliances, and networks. Actors may cooperate with each other because they share certain goals that cannot be attained by any single actor alone. However, they may also compete with each other because they have certain objectives that each actor must fulfil by itself. Designing and implementing such coopetitive strategies is challenging due to the paradoxical nature of cooperation and competition. Information Systems (IS) play a key role in establishing and supporting coopetition due to the importance of technologies including social media [4] in coopetitive strategies. Moreover, IS can also be impacted by the coopetitive strategies of actors. Therefore, a modeling framework that allows the structured and systematic expression and evaluation of strategic coopetition can be valuable for planning and decision-making.	information system;social media;strategic computing initiative	Vik Pant	2018				AI	-79.28330645823104	2.0719710590297953	168401

The progression of variance and process theories provide an in-depth overview of the emergence of richer accounts of IS change. In this paper we chronicle the evolution of process models and related theory. We also show how the application of process thinking in IS research has improved our understanding of complex IS change. These models depict more faithfully actors’ lived experiences and preserve the details and essential effects of critical events. An emerging benefit the process models is the capability to identify common patterns in a project’s evolutionary trajectory.	biconnected component;boxing;color gradient;complexity;emergence;evolution;experience;information systems;object type (object-oriented programming);organizational behavior;process modeling;sociotechnical system;theory	Abdulaziz Ahmad;Kalle Lyytinen;Mike Newman	2011			social science;economics;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;process theory;management science;sociology;management	HCI	-79.20740165837256	-1.1789344101861876	168530

The phases - Orienteering, Modeling and Mapping – and the key characteristics of an analysis approach are described, focusing on results and returns. Results are the expected and committed outputs of the analysis process, such as the modeling of workflow processes. Returns are the impacts of the process analysis on individual and social behavior, such as awareness and motivation. Returns support the definition of the key assets of an organization, influence the modeling of workflow processes and are useful to capture the non-workflow components of organizational processes.

Knowledge therefore becomes an important strategic asset within organizations. Consequently the management of knowledge is considered with special attention. This paper focuses on the transfer of knowledge between to units of a multinational corporation. The premise of this paper is that successful transfer of knowledge is dependent on the dimensions of the context the transfer process faces. It first gives an overview on main influence factors during the knowledge transfer process between two company units, and then investigates the question whether cultural differences in the sender units influence the knowledge transfer process. The paper finally presents a model of culture related factors influencing the knowledge transfer process between two company units located in geographically different places.

Inter-customer helping is a form of customer-to-customer interactions (CCI). CCIs are more common in the current economy where more customers deliver services on their own, without involvement of service workers through self-service technologies, and therefore, it is critical to understand CCI. However, there have been only limited efforts to understand interactions between customers, and more emphasis was on understanding the interactions between employees and customers. Thus, the current research fills this gap through investigating the effect of receiving help from another customer (vs. no help) on customer satisfaction during service failures. In particular, the current research suggests that receiving inter-customer helping (vs. receiving no help) would increase customer satisfaction through mitigating disappointment.

Nevertheless, a few authors have examined the adoption of FLOSS and its impact on organisational change and innovation. Adoption studies represent a particularly promising area for information system researchers to investigate the relationship between the specific properties of FLOSS and the processes of implementation and use. The goal of this paper is to contribute to this field of research by discussing a former multi-targeted research agenda and by defining an empirically grounded framework for studying FLOSS adoption, drawing on the outcomes of an exploratory multiple case study involving 16 Italian public administrations.

A conceptual model is developed based on a review of the major innovation adoption theories and other research findings, and tested with a survey administered through a census of the population of Lebanese banks. Findings revealed that the organizational variables of bank size, presence of functional divisions, technical staff and infrastructure, as well as the degree of international experience and tolerance of risk of the decision makers exert a significant impact on the adoption of E-banking. Two structural characteristics, the internal technological environment, and relative advantage of the innovations were also found to impact adoption. The two strategic factors related to the banks’ degree of international operations were also found to positively influence the adoption of E-banking. Recommendations were provided on ways of accelerating the rate of adoption of E-banking in an important developing Middle Eastern country.

Acceptance of BIS should not be understood only as frequency and intensity of use, which was the focus of most previous research focused mostly on operational IS. Using BIS must become embedded in the business value generation process. In this study we develop a conceptual model of BIS embeddedness with a specific set of determinants identified using exploratory analysis based on semi-structured interviews among professionals in the field. Understanding acceptance and use of BIS presents a priority item for both researchers and practitioners in the field alike, as better understanding of these factors might improve the utilization and business value of BIS in organizations.

ae7316d0ff25efd65f7dc2f5c92f0a084bfa7c3f	information product: how information consumers' perception of 'fitness for use' can be affected		Emerging paradigms such as big data, business data analytics and business data science increased the importance of focusing on the notion of data and information quality more than before. Although more mechanized processes are being used to prepare pieces of information to be fit-for-use for information consumers, how information consumers perceive the quality of information and its difference with the actual quality of information gets more important as information consumers are at the position to judge the quality. Motivated by the notion of Perceived Information Quality (PIQ), this study explains the role of adoption and implementation of Information Technology (IT) in the process of perceiving information quality by information consumers. For the purpose of this research, seven Iranian organizations were studied. Due to lack of proper communication and institutional link between these organizations and the technology developers, it has been challenging for the studied organizations to implement the adopted technologies in the context of use. This study finds that the solution which is provided for information quality issues after the implementation of a type of information technology has direct impact on perceived information quality. This solution can be the combination of technical solutions by the technology developers and contextual-situated solutions by local experts and the balance of these solutions can influence the information consumers’ perception. This research unfolds how the mechanism of technology implementation may reform the perceived information quality by drawing upon Information Product theory from the literature of information quality and the theory of Social Learning from the literature of social studies of technology. This mechanism of influence can be conceptualized as follows: a generic type of information technology is perceived to be useful and adopted by an organization. The organization faces challenges in implementing the new technology including dealing with information quality issues due to specific institutional and organizational context. The organization tries to provide a combination of solutions to overcome this challenge. The type and balance of solutions can form the perceived information quality by information consumers within the organization.	big data;conceptualization (information science);data science;fitness function;information quality;internationalization and localization;iranian.com;prefetch input queue;situated	Farjam Eshraghian;Stephen A.

Consequently, as firms launch new product development (NPD), it has become more critical to determine a method by which to integrate technology and knowledge together and to enhance absorptive capability (AC) of firms in the process of information, technology and knowledge sharing. This study thus combines the concepts of corporate social capital (CSC), intellectual capital, and AC, and discusses the influence of internal/external resource integration on technology integration mechanisms (TIM) and knowledge integration mechanisms (KIM), as well as AC’s effect on NPD. Three hundred and ninety-four valid responses were collected and partial least squares structural equation modeling was adopted for data analysis. The results show that interaction ties and the shared language of CSC positively affect TIM, while human capital and organizational capital have positive influences on KIM. In addition, TIM and KIM both have significant and positive influences on AC and AC further influences NPD performance. Therefore, this study suggests that firms have to establish interaction bases for utilizing external knowledge to assist in NPD, and this can be achieved by offering a friendly environment to encourage employees to be more willing to contribute their knowledge.	knowledge integration;new product development;partial least squares regression;social capital;structural equation modeling;system integration	Hsin Hsin Chang;Yao-Chuan Tsai;Chen Su Fu;Shu Hui Chen;Yao De Peng	2016	Information Systems Frontiers	10.1007/s10796-016-9629-y	knowledge management;marketing;operations management;management	AI	-81.65522211425663	3.91008621738025	170968

E-mail addresses: irene.fan@polyu.edu.hk, iren wb.lee@polyu.edu.hk (R.W.B. Lee). Innovation is the driving force for value creation and future survival of an organization. This paper proposes a study of organizational innovation performance with an intellectual capital-based view using complexity theory. It presents the methodologies and model for the study integrating survey study, structural equation modeling and an extended NK model. The constraints of NK model applying in management studies are also addressed. The model is developed based on the NK model, with extensions to allow non-binary alleles, non-integer degree of complexity and weighted contribution of different intellectual capital (IC) components to the fitness value of innovation performance. The weighted and informed NK model simulates an organization’s search for better innovation performance with the consideration of the current IC status of the organization, and the unique complexity and interdependency among the IC components. The methodologies and the simulation model have been applied on a R&D group in the information and communication technology industry with results that demonstrated the descriptive and predictive power of the model. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

How should a firm align its IT innovation with a dynamic industry? In addressing these questions we present a typology of IT Innovation and Environment Alignment (ITIEA) based on a firm's IT innovation strategic orientation and the industry environment. The traditional ‘fit’ perspective predicts that a firm that matches its IT innovation with a dynamic environment would obtain performance benefits. In contrast, the ‘options’ perspective suggests that a firm that takes advantage of a stable environment to proactively pursue IT innovation and develop IT capability as real options would obtain performance advantage. We employ a quasi-experiment design to test these two competing hypotheses using archival data of IT leaders over a time frame of 6 years. We perform a longitudinal analysis of the performance change trajectories of proactive and reactive IT leaders over time. The results indicate a general support for the ‘options’ perspective that proactive IT leaders that lead in innovation with IT in relatively stable environments are found to consistently outperform reactive IT leaders in overall performance, allocative efficiency, and cost efficiency in management process. However, interestingly, the results also show a partial support for the ‘fit’ perspective that reactive IT leaders that emphasize intensive deployment of IT innovation in dynamic environments are found to obtain a cost advantage in production and operation process over time. The findings offer practical implications for managers to better engage in IT innovations to create and sustain competitive advantage. Synthesizing options thinking and dynamic capability perspective, we provide a framework to better understand IT innovation, dynamic environment, and performance outcomes. The findings also shed useful light on whether, when, and how to innovate with IT for sustained competitive advantage.	proactive parallel suite	Ying Lu;Keshavamurthy Ramamurthy	2010	EJIS	10.1057/ejis.2010.36	economics;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;operations management;management information systems;management science;information technology;information system	NLP	-79.99341929929524	2.50426158312266	171034

From a project perspective, we examine which factors are necessary to realise IS developments' anticipated value. We use the existing literature and field study results from 29 organisations to collect a pool of items, which are merged in a questionnaire to help understand the mechanism of successful IT value realisation in organisations. We use the questionnaire to collect data from 456 individuals involved in IT projects; on the basis of this, we conduct exploratory factor analysis to determine the factor structure present in the data, and confirmatory factor analysis to validate the derived factor structure. Results indicate the presence of three specific benefits management capabilities and four contextual factors that facilitate effectiveness of these benefits management capabilities in realising the planned value of IS developments. The primary implication of our findings is the identification of the principal levers to derive IT-enabled value.	confirmatory factor analysis;exploratory factor analysis;field research	Kunal Mohan;Frederik Ahlemann;Jessica Braun	2014	2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2014.530	value engineering;knowledge management;marketing;business value;management science;management	HCI	-81.20154539359761	3.3100676826480218	171444

Focusing on relationships between suppliers and their organizational buyers, we augment this perspective by positing that relationship outcomes are also influenced by social comparison processes involving perceptions of a supplier’s practices across comparable buyer relationships. Based on past research on embedded ties and institutional theory, we propose that the effect of these comparison processes depends on the nature of a buyer’s existing interorganizational ties and on the norms that are brought to bear on the relationship in question. We test our propositions based on 788 observations of organizational buyers who have relationships with the same supplier. Our findings paint a complex, multilevel picture of the process by which relationship outcomes come about in interorganizational networks.	embedded system;semantic network	Alberto Sa Vinhas;Jan B.

This paper attempts to shed light on the relationships between the concerns of sustainability and longevity in software and requirements engineering. Disciplines related to longevity of information and of systems can bring interesting ideas and perspectives to the discussion of sustainability. At the same time, sustainability clearly is a crucial component and critical success factor in determining an actual system’s longevity. While many isolated techniques exist, the various definitions of sustainability are not all aligned, and clarity on the concepts is needed to move forward. We argue that it is crucial to consider sustainability not just in the sense of lean software, green computing and functional requirements for improving environmental sustainability, but also consider how it applies to the systems under design in a holistic perspective. We discuss possible relationships and synergies and outline a set of research questions for sustainability as a design concern.	functional requirement;holism;requirements engineering;synergy	Christoph Becker	2014			software;green computing;systems engineering;functional requirement;requirements engineering;business;critical success factor;sustainability;longevity;lean software development	SE	-78.27990885115459	-0.3160523009403245	172545

Design/methodology/approach – The data set consisted of 36 semi-structured interviews with IT security practitioners from 17 organizations (academic, government, and private). The interviews were analyzed using qualitative description with constant comparison and inductive analysis of the data to identify the challenges that security practitioners face. Findings – A total of 18 challenges that can affect IT security management within organizations are indentified and described. This analysis is grounded in related work to build an integrated framework of security challenges. The framework illustrates the interplay among human, organizational, and technological factors. Practical implications – The framework can help organizations identify potential challenges when implementing security standards, and determine if they are using their security resources effectively to address the challenges. It also provides a way to understand the interplay of the different factors, for example, how the culture of the organization and decentralization of IT security trigger security issues that make security management more difficult. Several opportunities for researchers and developers to improve the technology and processes used to support adoption of security policies and standards within organizations are provided. Originality/value – A comprehensive list of human, organizational, and technological challenges that security experts have to face within their organizations is presented. In addition, these challenges within a framework that illustrates the interplay between factors and the consequences of this interplay for organizations are integrated.	computer security;inductive reasoning;information security;security management;semiconductor industry	Rodrigo Werlinger;Kirstie Hawkey;Konstantin Beznosov	2009	Inf.

Specifically, we report on the emergent theme of information management strategy abandonment – that is, what factors in particular might cause people to give up on their systems for managing documents, calendars, email, and other sorts of project information. In exploring the recurrence of this theme throughout the interview data, five factors emerged as particularly compelling and frequently-cited reasons for system abandonment: (1) visibility, (2) integration, (3) co-adoption, (4) scalability, and (5) return on investment. We describe each of these factors in turn, using examples from the interviews for illustration. These findings, though preliminary in nature, provide a starting point for understanding why systems fail and how future systems might be designed to improve their success rate.	email;emergence;personal information management;scalability	Elisabeth A.

A theoretical framework is developed for examining IT adoption which is guided at the meta-level by the principles of structuration theory, but explicitly utilises the more familiar perspectives of culture, learning, and leadership in analysing an in-depth case study of the adoption of EDI in the London Insurance Market. The findings from the case study suggest that the initiation activities of innovation were facilitated by visionary leadership and legitimised by crisis in the market. In addition, a counterculture proved to be important in co-ordinating the innovation activities. However, conflicting interpretive schemes held by market participants as to how the new technology should be appropriated hindered organizational learning. Furthermore, leaders encountered difficulties in gaining commitment to their vision from market participants who anticipated unwelcome changes in power relations related to the introduction of the new technology. These elements contributed to a slow adoption process. The theoretical framework, together with the case findings, offer new insights on the adoption of IT to support business innovation, with a particular focus on large aggregates such as a market or industry.	barrett reduction;business process;circular shift;electronic data interchange;encapsulated postscript;relevance;service innovation;smith–volterra–cantor set;while	Michael I.

To mitigate the risks in implementing ERP systems, a knowledge based approach is followed. The ERP implementation team depends upon users for their knowledge to understand the business rules and processes required for the ERP systems. The value of ERP implementation is increased when users' tacit knowledge has been integrated into ERP systems. This paper attempts to understand how Canadian organisations are capturing the users' tacit knowledge in ERP implementation. A case study methodology is followed to accomplish the research objective. Three organisations from telecommunication, government, and retail sectors participated in the study. For data collection, semi-structured interviews were conducted with four to six respondents from each firm. The findings about tacit knowledge sharing in three firms that have implemented ERP systems are presented. The findings are categorised as follows: ERP adoption by all three firms, implemented ERP modules, users' tacit knowledge capturing and conversion, activities and approaches, users' tacit knowledge for interim modification and post-implementation. The lessons learned are given by presenting a cross-comparison of three case studies.	erp;exploratory testing	Ramaraj Palanisamy	2007	JIKM	10.1142/S0219649207001615	knowledge base;computer science;knowledge management;management science;business rule;data collection	HCI	-82.17424027807742	2.9990570501986222	174396
dd717476fe2512554fef631c628135c611bd0eed	knowledge management systems: a comparison of law firms and consulting firms	survey research	This paper reports results from a survey of Norwegian law firms on the use of information technology to support inter-organizational knowledge management. Two predictors of IT support were significant: firm cooperation and knowledge cooperation. Inter-organizational trust was not a significant predictor. Software and systems most frequently used include word processing, electronic mail and legal databases. It has been argued that law firms are old fashioned and not ready for extensive use of information technology. An impression is created that other professional service firms such as consulting firms are much more advanced. To evaluate the relative performance of law firms in the area of IT support for knowledge transfer an identical survey was conducted among a limited number of consulting firms in Norway. Survey results indicate that the average IT use in consulting firms was slightly higher than in law firms, but the most interesting differences were found in the different systems and software used rather than the level of IT use. Consulting firms are high-level users of general information sources on the Internet, while law firms are high-level users of structured information in databases.	database;email;high- and low-level;internet;kerrison predictor;knowledge management;management system	Petter Gottschalk	2000	InformingSciJ		descriptive knowledge;body of knowledge;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;procedural knowledge;marketing;knowledge value chain;law;personal knowledge management;organizational learning;sociology;substantive law	HCI	-84.02770289356216	2.373087756112817	174641

Rather, behavior is influenced by different levels of culture ranging from the supranational (regional, ethnic, religious, linguistic) level through the national, professional, and organizational levels to the group level. The objective of this study is to integrate these different levels of culture by explicitly recognizing that individualsâ€™ workplace behavior is a function of all different cultures simultaneously. It is theorized that the relative influence of the different levels of culture on individual behavior varies depending on the nature of the behavior under investigation. Thus, for behaviors that include a strong social component or include terminal and moral values, supranational and national cultures might have a predominant effect. For behaviors with a strong task component or for those involving competence values or practices, organizational and professional cultures may dominate. These propositions are illustrated with examples from the IS field. This paper is a conceptual study and therefore extends theory and the current understanding of how culture is examined by not only explicitly recognizing that behaviors are simultaneously influenced by multiple levels of culture but by also specifying conditions under which certain levels of culture dominate. Such an approach has the potential to inform researchers and practitioners about the generalizability or universality of theories and techniques across national, organizational, and professional borders.

Previously, scholars have studied motivations underlying non-conformance to policies and proposed approaches for motivating employees. However, the socio-cognitive aspects that shape employees' perceptions of the policies and implications for policy outcomes have received modest attention. This study draws on socio-cognitive concept of frames and on literature on information security policies to suggest a theoretical and analytical concept of Information Security Policy Frames of Reference (ISPFOR). The concept provides a sensitizing device to interpret how the frames influence organizational groups' perceptions of policies and the implications of the perceptions on policy outcomes. Three frame categories were uncovered through an interpretive case study at large multinational internet service provider. Findings suggest frames shape perceptions of policies and provide an explanation for unanticipated policy outcomes. Implications for research and practice are discussed.	conformance testing;information security;socio-cognitive	Marko Niemimaa;Anna Elina Laaksonen;Dan Harnesk	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.282	public relations;the internet;knowledge management;environmental resource management;marketing;information security standards;management;law	HCI	-82.28733517118752	-0.6437780465211671	175668

Past research reveals that these factors are highly relevant to both productivity and attrition. So we collected and analyzed data from 56 employees via a survey on self-beliefs and reports of work ethics related to both self and team. Preliminary analyses using demographics and psychographics were undertaken. Interestingly, we found that the two industries differed very little, on the variables measured. An interactionist perspective – according to which human attitude and behavior are a function of the fit between personality and the environment – and paying close heed to the voice of the employees or the vox populi are recommended.	attrition (website);report;vox	Deepa Athle;Aditi Kumar;Vinay Katiyar	2014		10.1145/2593702.2593717	employee engagement;engineering;management	HCI	-84.57806740651863	-1.2954936134498662	175671

Because the use of knowledge management systems (KMSs) continues to expand, understanding how these systems affect exploration and exploitation practices at the individual level is important to advance both knowledge management theory and practice. This study reports the results of a multi-industry survey investigating how psychological climate and KMS access influence solution reuse (exploitation) and solution innovation (exploration) in the context of technical support work. Our results show that KMS access does not directly determine solution innovation or solution reuse. Instead, KMS access strengthens the positive relationship between a climate for innovation and solution innovation and reverses the positive relationship between a climate for autonomy and solution innovation. The implications for knowledge management research and practice are discussed.	autonomy;exploit (computer security);knowledge management;management system;technical support	Alexandra Durcikova;Kelly J.

We argue that judgments about the acceptability and/or tolerability of such risks should be based on an evaluation of the likely societal impact of potential hazards, defined in terms of the expected changes in the capabilities of individuals. Capabilities refer to the functionings, or valuable doings and beings, individuals are able to achieve given available personal, material, and social resources. The likely impact of a hazard on individuals' capabilities should, we argue, be compared against two separate thresholds. The first threshold specifies the minimum level of capabilities attainment that is acceptable in principle for individuals to have in the aftermath of a hazard over any period of time. This threshold captures the level that individuals' capabilities ideally should not fall below. A risk is acceptable if the probability that the attained capabilities will be less than the acceptable level is sufficiently small. In practice, it can be tolerable for some individuals to temporarily fall below the acceptable threshold, provided this situation of lower capabilities attainment is temporary, reversible, and the probability that capabilities will fall below a tolerability threshold is sufficiently small. This second, tolerable threshold delimits an absolute minimum level of capabilities attainment below which no individual in a society should ever fall, regardless of whether that level of capabilities attainment is temporary or reversible. In this paper, we describe and justify this Capabilities-based Approach to the acceptability and tolerability of risks. We argue that the proposed theoretical framework avoids the limitations in current approaches to acceptable risk. The proposed approach focuses the attention of risk analysts directly on what should be our primary concern when judging the acceptability and the tolerability of risks, namely, how risks impact the well-being of individuals in a society. Also, our Capabilities-based Approach offers a transparent, easily communicable way for determining the acceptability and the tolerability of risks.	delimiter;eif2ak2 wt allele;half-life 2: episode one;hazard (computer architecture);human–robot interaction;it risk management;judgment;reversible computing;risk assessment;whole earth 'lectronic link	Colleen Murphy;Paolo Gardoni	2008	Science and engineering ethics	10.1007/s11948-007-9031-8	capability;ethics;actuarial science;risk analysis;economics;engineering;operations management;risk;management science;sociology;society;law	Web+IR	-81.20948720845061	-2.5643428920822524	175887

There are two main uses of ITs in marketing processes.  First, they increase the likelihood and efficiency of communication and cooperative relationships between different agents,  both inside and outside the organization. Second, they manage market data correctly, prioritizing its acquisition, storage  and dissemination throughout the company, thereby developing market intelligence that can be used in the decision-making process.  	conceptual schema	Enric Serradell-López;Ana Isabel Jiménez-Zarco;María Pilar Martínez-Ruiz	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04757-2_39	decision-making;product innovation;organizational learning;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;conceptual framework;process management;product management;law;information technology	DB	-78.007950364314	3.736679947609609	176276

Nevertheless, various researchers define KW from different economic perspectives. Instead of dichotomizing an occupation to be a KW or not, this research carefully scrutinizes detailed job descriptions of various occupations to determine the degree to which they are involved in various aspects of knowledge management (KM) activities. Based on the results, this research provides some exploratory evidence about the characteristics of KWs. The occupational wage comparisons between workers with higher and lower involvement in knowledge work enable this research to determine whether the market financially rewards KM activities of individuals. Moreover, comparisons among different aspects of knowledge work indicate economic differences associated with those KM activities. Findings of this research are expected to provide finer classifications for KW, to better understand the characteristics of KW, and to recognize the economic importance of KM activities, yielding implications for employees, educators, trainers, firms, and governments to face the challenges of the knowledge economy.	archive;knowledge management	Wei-Cheng Shen	2008		10.1145/1355238.1355281	engineering;knowledge management;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;management	Web+IR	-80.88752589440816	1.7544733682876565	176483

However, existing technology acceptance models do not consider the impact of changes on individual acceptance of information technology. This paper introduces the construct of technology change and integrates current technology acceptance models with social psychology theories of attitude change to propose a theory of technology acceptance under conditions of change. Beginning with a review of current technology acceptance models, this paper considers how they implicitly deal with IT change. A conceptualization of technology change focused on rate, magnitude, and distribution of change is then presented. Finally, a three-stage theoretical model of how technology change affects acceptance through individual attitudes and beliefs is presented. The core of the model focuses on the processes of forming attitudes and beliefs about technology change, changing attitudes and beliefs about the technology, and technology acceptance decision making. These processes are expected to be moderated by the visibility, relevance, and compatibility of the changes. This model, by integrating the reality of technology change with extensive research on technology acceptance, extends our understanding of the complex interplay between technology and people in dynamic, evolving information systems.	acceptance testing;conceptualization (information science);information system;relevance;theory	Xiaoqing Wang;Brian S.

We undertake to theorize more richly than has heretofore been done on the decision processing perspective of user acceptance of IT and, based on that, analyse different types of value-driven user motivations. Specifically, we draw on two metaphorical constructs – ‘attention economy’ and ‘high-tech gift economy’ – in order to understand valuedriven user responses to IT, and illustrate them through the example of Open Source Software (OSS) development teams. The focal point of interest is the adoption-diffusion continuum (from Prior Use to Post-adoptive Behaviour) within the context of end-user decision processing. A rough eValue anthology is introduced as a secondary epistemological level to aid clarifying when and how value-rational end-consumer action affects attitude toward use. The analysis is based on a unified view on user acceptance decision processing, combining the management perspective (Cooper and Zmud 1990), the user perspective (Rogers 1995), the organizational perspective (Swanson and Ramiller 2004), with emphasis on the decision processing perspective (Engel et al. 2001).	biological anthropology;emoticon;focal (programming language);intrinsic dimension;nl (complexity);open-source software;point of interest;triune continuum paradigm;word lists by frequency;world wide web	Elitsa Shumarova;Paul A.

This article establishes a link between the concept of lean product development and the field of knowledge management. The transfer of knowledge within any organisation is recognised as a challenging task and mastering that challenge is increasingly important. Numerous studies show that common knowledge transfer tools such as post-project reviews are problematic, which calls for improved ways of transferring knowledge. By relating Lean principles and methods to the knowledge creation framework developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi often referred to as the SECI-model, this article suggests that lean product development offers principles and methods that could provide a way of improving knowledge transfer in product development.	new product development	Ludvig Lindlöf;Björn Söderberg;Magnus Persson	2013	Int.

Successful adjustment of these newcomers to the role and organization has implications for performance, retention, and turnover of valuable knowledge workers. Organizations use several tactics to facilitate the new engineer's adjustment to the role and organization. This study investigated the socialization of 135 new engineers using the theoretical framework of organizational socialization tactics. The moderating effects of gender on new engineer adjustment are also examined since engineering is often described as a male-dominated profession. Results show that organizational socialization tactics strongly influence newcomer role clarity, workgroup integration, and task mastery. These proximal outcomes, in turn, lead to increased satisfaction and organizational commitment. Gender-specific differences are also found with regard to the impact of tactics on outcomes. Gender-moderated the effects of investiture, serial, and fixed tactics on role clarity and work group integration. Implications of the results for practice and theory are discussed.	commitment scheme;computer engineering;socialization	N.

However, the effect of these grants remains unclear. Acknowledging this gap, this study provides a nuanced perspective to understand the influence of government R&D grants on IT entrepreneurial firm performance. Based on the literature on organizational learning, we categorize government R&D grants into two types: explorative vs. exploitative. Moreover, drawing on resource complementarity theory, we articulate how the two types of government R&D grants interact with firms’ private R&D resources. In particular, we hypothesize that in the innovation stage, government explorative R&D grants complement a firm’s internal exploration in influencing innovation performance, but substitute a firm’s external exploration. We further posit that in the commercialization stage, government exploitative R&D grants complement a firm’s innovation performance and internal exploitation in impacting financial performance, but substitute a firm’s external exploitation. We advance a theory of public-private R&D interaction for IT entrepreneurial firms.	categorization;complementarity theory;exploit (computer security)	Jin Chen;Yuwei Jin;Cheng-Suang Heng;Bernard C. Y.

Organizations often rely on acquired knowledge from past experiences to make higher quality decisions on business strategies for better future performance. In this context, Knowledge Management (KM) and Organizational Memory (OM) become a central issue to the effectiveness of strategic decision-making and organizational performance. This paper examines the relationship between the (re)use of knowledge/organizational memory (OM) and the effectiveness of strategic decision-making in devising corporate strategies.

Evaluation is guided by addressing the questions: why is the evaluation is being done? What is being evaluated? Who affects the evaluation? When is the evaluation taking place? And how is the evaluation to be carried out? The framework reflects the identified need for more holistic processes for evaluating information systems and explains the role of interpretive methodologies in identifying the complex interplay of issues. The framework reflects the social, political and cultural factors that influence the economic benefits and emphasises the need for an integrated approach to evaluation. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

77a1f56c039ad775ad83dbc557b9458582c0361d	on knowledge management: intellectual assets as facilitating infrastructure		Successful implementation of knowledge management for organization requires a systematic and comprehensive perspective about various organizational factors. Appropriateness of these factors and their integration and coordination is a vital prerequisite to implement knowledge management effectively. The primary purpose of the research is investigating the relationship between three fundamental aspects of intellectual assets – human capital, structural capital and relational capital – with knowledge management practices. The method of the research is descriptive and co relational. The research was conducted in petrochemical Company in Tehran. The total number of personnel was 720 and the sample of 265 members of personnel was selected as statistical sampling. According to the research findings, there are significant relationships between these intellectual assets and knowledge management practices. These findings support the necessity of preparing the prerequisites of effective implementation of knowledge management. Accordingly an organization characterized by more developed intellectual capitals can benefit from knowledge management initiatives.

The factors were identified through a literature review and case studies of two organizations. The results of the pilot study and literature review reveal five groups of success factors that contribute to the success of B2B e-commerce. These factors were later assessed for importance using a survey. The outcome of our analysis reveals a reduced list of key critical success factors that SMEs should emphasize as well as a couple of key policy implications for governments in developing countries.	e-commerce payment system	Murray E.

In addition, they agree, that this determinant of social alignment is very complex and difficult to govern. However, a goal-oriented governance will only be possible if the target is clearly and adequate defined. In this paper, we will provide a structured review of the IS literature addressing the question how shared business/IT understanding has been conceptualized and used in the various fields of our research community. We identify strong differences between and within these research domains regarding the conceptualization. Primarily, we find that most of the papers just analyze single aspects of shared understanding but miss the “big picture”. Our findings can point researchers to potential lacks of conceptualization of Business/IT Shared Understanding in their research domain and will help to cross borders among different research strands, which all will potentially profit from a more holistic and comprehensive investigation of shared business/IT understanding and its role for effective collaboration among business and IT.	conceptualization (information science);holism	Christian Jentsch;Daniel Beimborn	2014			knowledge management;conceptualization;computer science;business value;corporate governance	HCI	-78.9405289956798	-0.09266960509812337	178368

We intend to find out why the ISD will be a success or a failure. In this research we sort out 192 examples of political games from 56 cases, which can be categorized into forty-one kinds of games. Some of them, because of their special features, appear only in one of the ISD stages of planning, development, or implementation. We have come to the following conclusions: The unclear performance evaluation system, role ambiguity, distrust placed in individuals, will induce more political games. And the political games will thus bring negative impacts on the organizational culture, too. Leading an easy life and providing lip service, game players usually exploit only the type of power I. The ten kinds of game players, including staying aloof exploit the type of power II, and then they can hold stronger power for they can act on their own, with no need to contact with others or to be bound by others’ interests or actions, and express this kind of behavior, through a cynical retreat from politics. The eleven kinds of games, including finding a scapegoat may unconsciously exaggerate the danger of conflict and reprisal, and therefore cause workers more anxiety, because the players use the type of power III. The other five kinds of game players, including building a favorable image use the type of power IV, which can promote workers’ interests and resolve conflicts while helping the workers develop some attachment to co-workers and the organization and lead to conventional organizational politics. This paper finds that the MIS manager and professionals play as many as half of the games, so it takes less effort to manage the MIS professionals in order to prevent many political behaviors. Finally, besides the four major adverse effects (deflection of goals, dilemmas of administration, dissipation of energies, and diversion of resources), the 0-7695-1435-9/02 $ forty-one kinds of games mentioned above can also result in a good effect—the success of project.	attachments;categorization;distrust;exploit (computer security);information system;performance evaluation;software release life cycle	Christina Ling-Hsing Chang;Tung-Ching Lin;Sheng Wu	2002		10.1109/HICSS.2002.994419	simulation;economics;computer science;artificial intelligence;marketing;operations management;management information systems;management;world wide web	HCI	-82.58299953426145	-1.0210921666429151	179093

The lack of holistic implementation approach to exploiting BPR is seen as one of the important reasons amongst others, behind BPR failures. Yet, a relative void in the literature remains the scarcity of suitable models and frameworks that address the implementation issues surrounding BPR. This motivates the presented study to attempt to provide a ‘frame of reference’ with which current practices can be re-positioned and in doing so, supporting management. A survey was therefore designed to collect data from a sample of organizations in the US and Europe. The survey assesses the level of importance placed on the essential elements of holistic BPR implementation. In doing so, the study was also able to identify the level of maturity of holistic BPR concepts within organizations. Empirical findings are then discussed in the context of other studies.	business process;capability maturity model;code refactoring;holism;software framework	Majed Al-Mashari;Zahir Irani;Mohamed Zairi	2001		10.1109/HICSS.2001.927135	business process reengineering;knowledge management;change management;management science;management	SE	-78.2328204477951	1.0282222168194528	179155
64481617e92cce95b744e9bd81b480b0d27da4e6	turning contradictions into innovations or: how we learned to stop whining and improve security operations		Efforts to improve the efficiency of security operation centers (SOCs) have emphasized building tools for analysts or understanding the human and organizational factors involved. The importance of viewing the viability of a solution from multiple perspectives has been largely ignored. Multiple perspectives arise because of inherent conflicts among the objectives a SOC has to meet and differences between the goals of the parties involved. During the 3.5 years that we have used anthropological fieldwork methods to study SOCs, we discovered that successful SOC innovations must resolve these conflicts to be effective in improving operational efficiency. This discovery was guided by Activity Theory (AT), which provided a framework for analyzing our fieldwork data. We use the version of AT proposed by Engeström to model SOC operations. Template analysis, a qualitative data analysis technique, guided by AT validated the existence of contradictions in SOCs. The same technique was used to elicit from the data concrete contradictions and how they were resolved. Our analysis provide evidence of the importance of conflict resolution as a prerequisite for operations improvement. AT enabled us to understand why some of our innovations worked in the SOCs we studied (and why others failed). AT helps us see a potentially successful and repeatable mechanism for introducing new technologies to future SOCs. Understanding and supporting all of the spoken and unspoken requirements of SOC analysts and managers appears to be the only way to get new technologies accepted and used in SOCs.	field research;requirement;system on a chip	Sathya Chandran Sundaramurthy;John McHugh;Xinming Ou;Michael Wesch;Alexandru G.

Since 2003 business intelligence (BI) and business analytics have gained popularity in practice. In theory and research the period since 2003 has seen a change in the decision-making theory orthodoxy and the codification and acceptance of design science. To investigate the changes in the DSS field, a number of expectations were derived from previous literature analyses. These expectations were assessed using bibliometric content analysis. The article sample to 2010 now includes 1466 articles from 16 journals. The analysis of the expectations yields mixed results for the DSS field. On the negative side, there has been an overall decline in DSS publishing, the relevance of DSS research published in journals to IT professionals has declined, and the rigor of DSS research designs has not improved. On the positive side, there has been improvement in relevance to managers, grant funding of DSS research has increased, there has been a positive shift in judgment and decision-making foundations, BI publishing has increased, and group support systems publishing has reduced to a more balanced level. An important result from the analysis of the last 7 years of DSS research is the significant increase in DSS design-science research (DSR) to almost half of published articles. It is clear from the analysis that DSS is undergoing a transition from a field based on statistical hypothesis testing and conceptual studies to one where DSR is the most popular method.

The networked organizational environment has brought along novel requirements for extreme flexibility and openness in directing operations, and consequently, pose novel challenges in managing the human resource pool. These challenges are summarized into two broad categories: promoting cultural integration and ensuring continuous renewal. The integration promotion takes place in core processes for building up the shared social architecture and for realizing the coordinated cooperation. The continuous renewal, in turn, is managed through innovation and entrepreneurial empowerment processes. Based on this examination, we address the questions for the SIS role in supporting the organizational change process and in facilitating the efficient communication in cross-boundary relationships. In the final part, some recommendations are presented for the educational activities and for personnel training in organizations.		Lic. Sc.

However, there is little published academic literature which reports systematic studies that explain how IS organizations implement 404. Institutional theory was adopted as the lens through which to examine the experiences of 404 implementation in three global organizations. The methodology for the research involved in-depth case study analysis. We conclude that key implementation drivers for 404 are directives from senior authorities, financial and resource subsidies, standards being set and adhered to, and knowledge being deployed. The findings are believed to present significant insights into the complexities and role of IS in providing valid and appropriate approaches to 404 compliance.	directive (programming);http 404;information systems	Ashley Braganza;Ray Hackney	2008	JOEUC	10.4018/joeuc.2008040101	accounting;public relations;social science;institutional theory;management;information system	HCI	-80.1267452187093	-2.044350093357099	180867

However, threat perception can then trigger a response that accentuates organizational rigidity. This cognitive paradox is explored using a multilevel, longitudinal case study of a newspaper organizations response to digital publishing. The results suggest that the competing frames of threat and opportunity can coexist within the firm when it creates organizationally differentiated subunits. Such a structure minimizes the need to integrate competing frames at the subunit level, enabling different behaviors to be enacted simultaneously across different units of the firm. This differentiated organizational form places an increased burden on senior teams that have to manage the inconsistencies across subunits. Insight into the structure of competing frames has broader implications for the structure of dynamic capabilities.	coexist (image)	Clark G.

We have previously drawn attention to the paradox in KS security and Information Systems (IS) security. Far too little attention has been paid to integrate security into KS. Thus, this study proposes a conceptual framework of Knowledge Risk Governance (KRG) to illustrate how governance of KS risks can be applied to decrease the risks of KS. To understand how KS could be improved, we draw upon Social Exchange Theory (SET) to examine and improve KS behavior. The potential constructs for the KRG framework were identified through literature review. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to investigate factors of the KRG framework. Finally, this paper demonstrates the importance of the KRG framework to enhance KS.	computer security;information system;windows legacy audio components	Azadeh Sarkheyli;Rose Alinda Alias;Norafida Binti Ithni	2014			knowledge management;environmental resource management;data mining	AI	-80.9337297409132	-2.489579037077443	181516

This complexity is characterized by forces that ebb and flow in wavelike patterns as societal expectations evolve, with attention coalescing around specific events and then dissipating. Some of these critical events are broad and affect many firms, whereas others are narrow and affect individual firms. In either case, when they occur, these events elevate organizational susceptibility to societal demands but encourage different kinds of behavior in response. This study seeks to model this complexity in an area of growing interest for organization scholars-business ethics. In particular, I examine how firms respond to shifting societal pressures for greater ethical behavior by adopting and implementing the Ethics and Compliance Officer position, from 1990 to 2008. Results demonstrate that although firms decide when to adopt in response to broad fieldwide critical events, it is narrower firm-specific critical events that determine resource commitments in implementation.

A systematic literature review based on papers that mentioned ERPs was drawn from eight of the most highly ranked journals according to their hindex. The findings indicate that the majority (96.6%) of the papers on ERP systems described research that was conducted within a positivist research paradigm, which is a far higher proportion than is suggested by other research in the general IS literature (approximately 81%). Paradigm selection has a profound impact upon the subsequent nature of the body of knowledge that is developed in any area of inquiry. Given the findings of this study demonstrated the dominance of a single paradigm this paper suggests that there is a strong case for ERP researchers to re-examine paradigm selection. In particular, to review how effectively this present paradigm selection helps or hinders to the development of the ERP body of knowledge, especially in respect to the issues of importance to managers within organizations (notably those concerned with social and change management issues). This research also identifies areas where existing paradigm evaluation methods could be enhanced and refined in respect to nonpositivist classifications.	cellular automaton;erp;enterprise resource planning;information system;interpretation (logic);programming paradigm;sampling (signal processing);systematic review;systems theory	Kevin Burgess;Don V.

This research proposal presents a study that extends and validates this theoretical framework through an integrated conceptual model. The research question examined is ‘does the continued use of intelligent decision aids reduce the auditor’s skills in forming their professional judgment?’ No prior research has explored deskilling of auditor judgment. The research is important for practice to ensure a strong audit profession, and contributes to theory through extension of the theoretical foundations of the deskilling effect. The theoretical extension is undertaken through an integration of cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988), Anderson’s (1993) cognitive architecture of Adaptive Control of ThoughtRational, and the Theory of Technology Dominance (Arnold & Sutton, 1998). The resultant conceptual model is planned for validation through semi-structured interviews with senior auditors. The qualitative data is subjected to thorough textual analysis adopting both the cross-case analytical matrices of Lillis (1999) and the Leximancer textual analysis tool (Smith, 2000). As of April 2011, fifty-nine interviews have been undertaken and transcribed, with the research study planned for finalisation by September 2012.	arnold;cognitive architecture;resultant;semiconductor industry	Micheal Axelsen	2011			judgment;social science;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;sociology;management;social psychology;law;computer security	AI	-83.60832426735006	0.4484697916714136	183363

The strategic concerns of IT training for enhancing business productivity largely are not addressed by the current literature. In this article, we explore the strategic concerns of IT training in hierarchical organizations, which are typically prevalent in developing countries. We synthesize various ideas in the literature on change management, training needs analysis, and IT adoption in order to evolve a strategic IT training framework for hierarchical organizations. The proposed framework recognizes the differences in IT training requirements for different levels of employees and suggests a differentiated training content for different segments of employees. The training framework provides an actionable and comprehensive tool that can be used for systematically planning IT training for enhancing productivity of organizations.	change management (engineering);needs analysis;requirement	Shirish C.

This paper contributes to emerging work on boundary theory by examining the extent to which individuals desire to integrate or segment their work and nonwork lives. This desire is conceptualized and measured on a continuum ranging from segmentation (i.e., separation) to integration (i.e., blurring) of work and nonwork roles. We examine the fit between individuals’ desires for integration/segmentation and their access to policies that enable boundary management, suggesting that more policies may not always be better in terms of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Using survey methodology and a sample of 460 employees, we found that desire for greater segmentation does moderate the relationship between the organizational policies one has access to and individuals’ satisfaction and commitment. People who want more segmentation are less satisfied and committed to the organization when they have greater access to integrating policies (e.g., onsite childcare) than when they have less access to such policies. Conversely, people who want greater segmentation are more committed when they have greater access to segmenting policies (e.g., flextime) than when they have less access to such policies. Moreover, the fit between desire for segmentation and organizational policy has an effect on satisfaction and commitment over and above the effects of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, income, number of children, and the ages of those children.	fo (complexity);nl (complexity);triune continuum paradigm	Nancy P.

Although the success of agile development projects depends considerably on the willingness of customers to actively participate, little research has examined which factors of such methodologies customers perceive as benefits or drawbacks. Employing an exploratory, primarily qualitative study design and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory as theoretical lens, we identify several acceptance factors of Scrum as a specific methodology and describe how customers perceive them. As basis for our examination, we use empirical data that was collected at a world-wide leading insurance company and a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative with quantitative data analyses. The results suggest that customers found Scrum to deliver relative advantages. Furthermore, they indicate that Scrum is perceived as more compatible to the way customers prefer to work in development projects. Factors that characterize the perceived complexity of Scrum were viewed as potential acceptance barriers, however.	acceptance testing;agile software development;complexity;scrum (software development);waterfall model	Sebastian Schlauderer;Sven Overhage	2013			knowledge management;marketing;scrum;management	HCI	-83.25996918070406	2.601923790218444	184025

What is clear, however, is that the current IT solutions are not satisfactory. In this research, we suggest the affordance construct as an analytical lens to understand how technological artefacts and human agency can generate action possibilities to support horizontal process innovation by asking: (i) which affordances enable digitalisation of patient centred healthcare, and (ii) how can these identified affordances be leveraged to innovate patient centred digital hospitals. Our empirical evidence is a comparative study of two hospitals in Sweden and Norway. Our theoretical contribution is the identification of six horizontal affordances for patient centred care. The practical contribution is that horizontal affordances emerge through configurations of human actors and lightweight IT solutions, loosely coupled to heavy weight systems.	loose coupling	Bendik Bygstad;Magnus Bergquist	2018			knowledge management;computer science;affordance;health care;nursing	HCI	-80.43238034276969	-1.5917237836982792	184591

This understanding considers organizational factors such as strategic alignment, governance, people, and culture as important aspects of BPM beyond Information Technology (IT) and methods. Particularly, organizational culture has been increasingly recognized as a critical success factor for the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes. While existing research already examined which cultural values determine a supportive environment for realizing BPM objectives and how these values can be measured, it has not been explored to date how such a supportive organizational culture can be developed. Based on a review of the literature, we therefore investigate the case of a global IT software provider to gain a first understanding of strategies organizations can implement to develop a supportive cultural setting for their BPM approach. We show how these findings extend recent studies in BPM research.	beam propagation method;business process;holism;information system;software publisher;united states computer emergency readiness team;value (ethics)	Sanja Tumbas;Theresa Schmiedel	2013			organizational culture;computer science;knowledge management;business process management;management science;management	HCI	-79.70535932030728	0.5460893338984744	184895

Coopetition is a relational mode frequently applied by information and communications technologty (ICT) firms. Using a qualitative approach, this study investigates the evolution of inter-firms coopetitive agreements in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) industry, and on the basis of this data, attempts to discuss coopetition typology and stability in this specific market context. The findings indicate the existence of two main types of coopetitive agreements, coopetitive projects with (i) vertical or (ii) horizontal cooperation between the competing partners. These two coopetition types have different characteristics in terms of purpose, dynamics and stability, presenting a specific balance between competitive tensions and collaboration benefits. The study concludes with a summary of the main findings and with practical propositions directed towards alliance managers.	biological anthropology	Estelle Pellegrin-Boucher;Frédéric Le Roy;Calin Gurau	2013	Techn.

In accordance with design studies, the relevance of research and its quality are evaluated against practice. The two cases discussed in the paper highlight that, in practice, innovation ecosystem actors must manage activities and relationships at the level of both individual and organisation. This finding has interesting research implications, as innovation ecosystems have been studied mostly at either macro or interpersonal (micro) level while the organisation (meso) level is seldom discussed. Furthermore, the findings should help managers to strive for and utilise innovation ecosystems better and to evaluate their ability and potential to survive via internal and external collaboration aimed at innovation.

A dynamic theory of organizational knowledge creation. Organ. Sci. 5(1) 14–37] contributed to the concepts of “tacit knowledge” and “knowledge conversion” in organization science. We present work that shaped the development of organizational knowledge creation theory and identify two premises upon which more than 15 years of extensive academic work has been conducted: (1) tacit and explicit knowledge can be conceptually distinguished along a continuum; (2) knowledge conversion explains, theoretically and empirically, the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge. Recently, scholars have raised several issues regarding the understanding of tacit knowledge as well as the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge in the theory. The purpose of this article is to introduce and comment on the debate about organizational knowledge creation theory. We aim to help scholars make sense of this debate by synthesizing six fundamental questions on organizational knowledge creation theory. Next, we seek to elaborate and advance the theory by responding to questions and incorporating new research. Finally, we discuss implications of our endeavor for organization science.	knowledge management;triune continuum paradigm	Ikujiro Nonaka;Georg von Krogh	2009	Organization Science	10.1287/orsc.1080.0412	innovation;organizational theory;organizational learning;empirical evidence;economics;knowledge economy;knowledge management;body of knowledge;knowledge engineering;management science;procedural knowledge;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;management;domain knowledge	NLP	-78.2507130975397	-1.1181297603529576	186380

The study focused on the influence of virtual research and development (R&D) teams within Malaysian manufacturing small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The specific objective of the study is better understanding of the application of collaborative technologies in business, to find the effective factors to assist SMEs to remain competitive in the future. The paper stresses to find an answer for a question “Is there any relationship between company size, Internet connection facility and virtuality?”. The survey data shows SMEs are now technologically capable of performing the virtual collaborative team, but the infrastructure usage is less. SMEs now have the necessary technology to begin the implementation process of collaboration tools to reduce research and development (R&D) time, costs and increase productivity. So, the manager of R&D should take the potentials of virtual teams into account.

d3fd9e741f161696363171ef683123dd1823251e	challenges of blockchain technology adoption for e-government: a systematic literature review		The ability of blockchain technology to record transactions on distributed ledgers offers new opportunities for governments to improve transparency, prevent fraud, and establish trust in the public sector. However, blockchain adoption and use in the context of e-Government is rather unexplored in academic literature. In this paper, we systematically review relevant research to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain adoption for e-Government. The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption. Moreover, the lack of legal and regulatory support is identified as the main environmental barrier of adoption. Based on the challenges presented in the literature, we propose future research questions that need to be addressed to inform how the public sector should approach the blockchain technology adoption.	bitcoin;capability maturity model;e-government;point of view (computer hardware company);reference architecture;scalability;systematic review;unintended consequences	F.

International Journal of Information Management, 33, 775). The primary objective is to identify information behaviors and values that could describe the information culture in the context of project team work while knowledge creation occurs, resulting in technological innovation. The secondary aim is to find resulting relationships between the TICs and the modes of knowledge conversion. Twelve university project teams were selected to participate in the study. The teams are part of the Partnership for Technological Innovation Research Program (PITE) from the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil. The qualitative technique of categorical content analysis was used. The data analysis is based on a set of five attributes: (i) the primary goal of information management; (ii) information values and norms; (iii) information behaviors in terms of information needs, (iv) information seeking, and (v) information use. The main results are twofold. First, we confirmed the existence of two dominant culture profiles, as hypothesized by Choo ((2013). International Journal of Information Management, 33, 775). Second, results also showed plausible relationships between the risk-taking culture and externalization of knowledge; the rule-following culture and the combination of knowledge; result-oriented culture and internalization of knowledge; and the relationship-based culture and socialization of knowledge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents findings from a study that examines the degree to which institutional pressures effect the assimilation of security-related policies and procedures, i.e. The level of adoption. We examine the forces that influence assimilation of policies. Consistent with prior research, we measure mimetic, normative, and coercive forces, as perceived by managers in our sample organizations, and the current level of security-related policy assimilation. We find that the strength and significance of all three forces are confirmed.	data assimilation;disaster recovery;information security	Kevin P.

The literature on digital transformation focuses on digital business strategy and the transformational CIO. Stakeholder engagement in combination with leadership style is seldom discussed. Our research questions are (i) what characterises leadership in the digital transformation, and (ii) what does the Scandinavian workplace model add to the knowledge of digital transformation? Our empirical evidence is the digital transformation in a large airline, the SAS, during the years 2013-16. The process was very turbulent but eventually quite successful. We identify two Scandinavian contributions to transformation research: firstly, the deep engagement with employees, including trade unions, supports a structured process with a focus on finding solutions, not conflicts. Second, a coaching leadership style, allowing space for autonomy, leverages the competence of highlyskilled employees.

We found that the use of short–term partnership models, lack of funding, failure to deliver results by third–party vendors, poor leadership and digital divide problems have impeded the successful implementation of the e–government programme. We suggest that a collective stakeholder involvement of government, private sectors, including third–party vendors and citizens as 'strategic' partners is essential in the creation of an enabling e–government partnership.

e46271a0479cf99bf44440019ffaec3880e6c375	interdisciplinary review of business continuity from an information systems perspective: toward an integrative framework		Hackers, malicious users, system malfunctions, and other incidents can disrupt organizational IS and cause severe organizational losses or even impact societies as a whole. In this paper, I review interdisciplinary literature on business continuity from an information systems (IS) perspective to increase understanding on how organizations can prepare for and respond to incidents. I use a narrative review approach with descriptive elements to review 83 peerreviewed papers published between 2000-2012 across a wide array of journals and disciplines. I identify themes across the past contributions, join the currently isolated streams of literature under a concept of IS continuity, and identify research gaps in the current knowledge. The results suggest that one can understand past contributions in terms of four themes that emerged from the literature: (1) social aspects as IS continuity enabler, (2) technology as IS continuity enabler, (3) salience of IS continuity, and (4) models that improve IS continuity. To move toward an integration of the past research, and to pinpoint research gaps, I present an integrative framework. Further, the research contributes to forming an IS continuity community to facilitate cooperation and communications among scholars sharing a common interest.	business continuity;information systems;scott continuity	Marko Niemimaa	2015	CAIS		systems engineering;knowledge management;management science	ML	-79.04049156613132	-0.9091450605654482	191719

Drawing from the strategic leaning perspective on adaptation, this study investigates how the nature of inter-organizational ties among top management impact the cost and the effectiveness of an organizational level change process. To build on the existing empirical work in this area, this study employs a virtual experiment to create a controlled laboratory investigation of the hypothesized relationships among the strength, formalization, and functional equivalence of network ties; and the cost and effectiveness of an organizational change process. The findings of this study provide support for the strength of weak ties argument and structural hole theory, in addition to suggesting a caveat to Galbraith's information processing model. Furthermore, the results reveal that the tradeoff between increasing effectiveness and decreasing costs is not universally applicable across all decisions regarding network structure.

Findings – The proposed framework complements practice-oriented management research. While there is a significant body of literature dealing with workplace action-learning approaches, still it is not clear what approach to use in what situation. The proposed framework might assist in this task since it recognises different configurations of practice and their associated PK.

It illuminates the potentially negative outcomes of change at the level of the employee. In addition, it relates to the ongoing debate over how employees react to and respond to organizational change. I hypothesize that change increases the risk of negative stress, and I test this hypothesis using a comprehensive panel dataset of all stress-related medicine prescriptions for 92,860 employees working in 1,517 of the largest Danish organizations. The findings suggest that the risk of receiving stress-related medication increases significantly for employees at organizations that change, especially those that undergo broad simultaneous changes along several dimensions. Thus organizational changes are associated with significant risks of employee health problems.

The study is carried out within project-based organizations, specifically targeting construction firms in Indonesia. Prior to the main study, an instrument to measure the two key variables are developed and tested for validity and reliability. Top or senior management representing the respective organizations are invited to the study (response rate=25.3%, n=117 after data preparation). Initial result suggests a positive association between KMM and performance. A cluster analysis is also performed to identify profiles of identified groups of construction organizations.	capability maturity model;cluster analysis;knowledge management;linkage (software)	Budi Hartono;V.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on theoretical proposition that IT business value is generated by the deployment of IT and complementary organizational resources, a research model was developed and two hypotheses were proposed. These are tested with a survey from 466 top managers in Italian companies. The 466 questionnaires were analyzed in two steps. In the first step, a series construct validation using factor analysis was performed in order to validate the scales. In the second step, a series of analyses using linear regression was performed between the two independent variables and the dependent variable to validate the mediator function of the IT organizational assimilation capacity. Findings – Data suggest that most firms have not merged information system (IS) integration with the right complementary organizational resources. The findings also support the notion that competitive advantage does not arise from replicable resources, but from complex, firm-specific and intangible resources and capabilities. The findings help to explain why some firms struggle while others flourish with the same ITs, and why IT-based advantages tend to dissipate so rapidly. Research limitations/implications – The research suggests that ITs do not merge themselves automatically with human and business resources. Evolving Leavitt’s organization diamond and using the paper’s data it can be shown that ISs, process, change, flexibility and training are interrelated and mutually adjusting, so when ISs are changed the other components often adjust to dump out the impact of the innovation. Practical implications – The proposed model can be used complementary to the requirements methods offered by the IS development methodologies, to mitigate their inherent defects in addressing social, organizational and other non-technical issues, when developing a new IS. Originality/value – This paper proposes a model to be used complementary to the requirements methods offered by the IS development methodologies	data assimilation;factor analysis;information system;requirement;software deployment	Vincenzo Morabito;Marinos Themistocleous;Alan Serrano	2010	J.

Complex in nature, this resource is difficult to imitate and thus, gives an organization strategic advantage. In this paper I discuss that knowledge that helps an organization attain success can also drive its failure by inducing a sense of inertia in the face of environmental change and biasing decisions towards those taken in the past. This paradoxical property of knowledge, though hinted at in various literatures, has not been discussed in much detail. Using the story of Indian automaker Hindustan Motors Limited, and its well-known car model, the Ambassador, I attempt to highlight this property of knowledge. I argue that the paradox makes inquiry into management of knowledge problematic, and call for further research on the phenomenon.	biasing;knowledge management	J.

Specifically, we examine how a brokerage position coupled with aspiration--performance gaps affects an organization's propensity to initiate ties to partners of different status. We find that organizations in brokerage positions are more likely than nonbrokers to initiate such ties systematically. However, when the performance of an organization in a brokerage position deviates from its aspirations, the organization changes its partner selection strategy and starts initiating ties to partners of similar status. Our results also suggest that organizations in brokerage positions set social and historical aspiration levels differently from nonbrokers, levels that in turn affect decisions about partner selection.	prince	Andrew V.

Using an established business–technology alignment model, we analyze an agency’s strategic alignment choice and examine the outcomes and agency performance associated with that alignment. The specific research questions addressed in the study are as follows: (1) Do strategic alignment choices vary among agencies that differ in purpose or position within the overall government hierarchy? (2) Do agencies’ alignment choices lead to different outcomes? and (3) Does performance in implementing, operating, and using ERMS vary among agencies that follow different alignment choices? We conducted a large-scale survey study of 3,319 government agencies in Taiwan. Our data support the propositions tested. Based on the findings, we discuss their implications for digital government research and practice.	archive;autonomous robot;benchmark (computing);best practice;criticality matrix;database;e-government;management system;naa govindasamy;outsourcing;seamless3d;strategic management	Fang-Ming Hsu;Paul Jen-Hwa Hu;Hsinchun Chen	2006			public relations;e-government;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;management;world wide web;strategic alignment	HCI	-80.10211085437889	2.017336301317657	195206

An interactionist model among trust and technological, organizational, and environmental factors was developed. A survey of 239 supply chain managers in Jordan was used to test the proposed model. Analyzed data shows that the moderating impact of trust was significant in one path, which was perceived desirability (stemming from the diffusion of innovation theory and representing the technological view). Trust did not moderate the impacts of organizational and environmental variables. The findings provided insights into how existing relationships between trading partners may not be flexible enough to absorb new technology. In a context in which trust beliefs are well established and critical such as Jordan, the flexibility of firms in responding to adoption motivations may be hampered rather than enabled.	b2b e-commerce	Abdallah Alsaad;Rosli Mohamad;Noor Azizi Ismail	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.040	toe;trustworthy computing;social psychology	AI	-82.52079368236065	3.8542293409018256	195499

The objective of this paper is to (1) understand the negative effects of technostress on the extent to which end users perceive the applications they use to be satisfactory and can utilize them to improve their performance at work and (2) identify mechanisms that can mitigate these effects. Specifically, we draw from the end-user computing and technostress literature to develop and validate a model that analyzes the effects of factors that create technostress on the individual’s satisfaction with, and task performance using, ICT. The model also examines how user involvement in ICT development and support mechanisms for innovation can be used to weaken technostress-creating factors and their outcomes. The results, based on survey data analysis from 233 ICT users from two organizations, show that factors that create technostress reduce the satisfaction of individuals with the ICT they use and the extent to which they can utilize ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. Mechanisms that facilitate involvement of users, and encourage them to take risks, learn, explore new ideas, and experiment in the context of ICT use, diminish the factors that create technostress and increase satisfaction with the ICT they use. These mechanisms also have a positive effect on users’ appropriation of ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. The paper contributes to emerging literature on negative outcomes of ICT use by (1) highlighting the influence of technostress on users’ satisfaction and performance (i.e., productivity and innovation in ICT-mediated tasks) with ICT, (2) extending the literature on technostress, which has so far looked largely at the general behavioral and psychological domains, to include the domain of end-user computing, and (3) demonstrating the importance of user involvement and innovation support mechanisms in reducing technostress-creating conditions and their ICT use–related outcomes. Key wordS and phraSeS: end-user performance, end-user satisfaction, ICT use, information overload, survey research, technostress, user involvement. organizaTional uSe of inforMaTion and coMMunicaTionS TechnologieS (icT) has become complex, real-time, ubiquitous, and functionally pervasive, often requiring users to process information simultaneously and continually from different applications and devices. Consequently, ICT users deal with a surfeit of information, experience frequent interruptions from different computing devices and applications, and engage in multitasking on them. further, they are increasingly frustrated and overwhelmed by continual efforts required to master the frequent introduction of new ICT. In recent times, therefore, managers have experienced negative cognitions toward ICT. recent academic literature has encapsulated these cognitions in the concept of technostress [65], which is stress caused by an inability to cope with the demands of organizational computer usage. Technostress describes the stress that users experience as a result of application multitasking, constant connectivity, information overload, frequent system upgrades and consequent uncertainty, continual relearning and consequent job-related IMpaCT Of TEChNOSTrESS ON END-uSEr SaTISfaCTION aND pErfOrMaNCE 305 insecurities, and technical problems associated with the organizational use of ICT. from the perspective of psychological outcomes, technostress reduces individuals’ job satisfaction and commitment to their organization [65]. from the point of view of behavioral outcomes, it reduces individuals’ productivity at work [75]. What is the potential effect of these negative cognitions on outcomes relating to the individual’s use of ICT? There is research evidence [8, 35, 63] that in spite of continuing sophistication in the functional capabilities of ICT, technology overload and ICT-mediated interruptions reduce the satisfaction of users with the ICT they employ for their tasks and their ability to benefit from them. Emerging practitioner perspectives [22, 78] reinforce these findings, suggesting that excessive information, frequent upgrades, and blurring of work–home boundaries induced by pervasive connectivity result in inaccurate information processing and poor task-related decision making using ICT and in dissatisfaction with ICT. at the same time, organizational computing environments have an important role for the end user in generating, accessing, analyzing, and using business information and in accomplishing application-enabled workflows. In such environments, it is critical that end users be satisfied with the applications and systems they interact with and work on and be able to effectively use them to enhance the quality and efficiency of their work tasks [16, 45, 81]. understanding how these “negative” or “unconstructive” aspects of ICT and the negative cognitions associated with them affect user satisfaction and ICT-mediated task performance is therefore clearly an important step in managing and appropriating benefits from current commuting environments. research in this area is emerging and scarce, and there is absence of (1) a theoretical framework for understanding and (2) systematic empirical investigation for demonstrating how these aspects impact the user in his or her day-to-day application of ICT to organizational tasks. recognizing that the concept of technostress encompasses user-perceived negative cognitions about ICT, we apply the technostress lens to this research gap and enunciate a twofold objective of this paper. The first objective is to understand the (adverse) effects of technostress on the extent to which end users perceive the applications they use to be satisfactory and can utilize them to improve their performance at work. Second, we identify mechanisms that can reduce these effects. Specifically, we draw from the end-user computing and organizational stress literature to develop and validate a model that analyzes the effects of factors that create technostress on end-user satisfaction and end-user performance. We further study how stress-alleviating factors, such as mechanisms that facilitate user involvement in ICT development and those that support innovation, can be used to weaken technostresscreating conditions and their outcomes. The results, based on survey data analysis from 233 ICT users from two organizations, show that factors that create techno stress reduce users’ satisfaction with the ICT they use and the extent to which they utilize ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. Mechanisms that facilitate involvement of users and encourage them to take risks, learn, explore new ideas, and experiment in the context of ICT use diminish the factors that create technostress for them and increase their satisfaction with the ICT they use. These mechanisms also have a positive effect on users’ appropriation of ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. The paper 306 TarafDar, Tu, aND ragu-NaThaN contributes to emerging literature on “negative” outcomes of organizational ICT use by (1) highlighting the importance of technostress on users’ satisfaction with ICT and on their performance—that is, their productivity and innovation—in ICT-mediated tasks, (2) extending the literature on technostress, which has so far looked largely at the general behavioral and psychological domains, to include the domain of end-user computing, and (3) demonstrating the importance of user involvement and innovation support mechanisms in reducing technostress-creating conditions and outcomes. Next, we provide a theoretical background by reviewing studies on stress and technostress, and then we develop the research model and hypotheses. In the fourth section, we describe methods and validate the model. The paper closes with a discussion of the findings and research and managerial implications. Theoretical Background Organizational Stress STreSS iS a cogniTive STaTe experienced by an individual when there is an “environmental situation that is perceived as presenting a demand which threatens to exceed the person’s capabilities and resources for meeting it, under conditions where he or she expects a substantial differential in the rewards and costs from meeting the demand versus not meeting it” [56, p. 1351]. It is a reaction to the perceived imbalance between a person and the environment [9, 19], borne out of anticipation of an inability to adequately respond to demand from the imbalance and accompanied by the expectation of negative consequences for inadequate response [56]. as shown in figure 1, the phenomenon of stress consists of three aspects—stressors, strain, and situational variables [52]. Stressors represent factors or conditions that create stress. These conditions could be due to the individual’s role [50] and task [56]. role stress and task stress have been widely studied. More recently, technology in general and ICT in particular have Figure 1. general relationships among Stressors, Strain, and Situational Variables IMpaCT Of TEChNOSTrESS ON END-uSEr SaTISfaCTION aND pErfOrMaNCE 307 emerged as conditions for the cause of stress [20]; this is the focus of technostress.

Giddens’ theory of modernity and an anthropological view of culture are used to analyze and interpret the case. As an expert system, in Giddens’ terms, partly leading to globalization (Giddens, 1990; 1991), ICTs facilitate the disembedding of information and communication transfer in different time-space domains without the limitation of place and therefore enable the head office to control its worldwide operations at a distance. However, this is not simply the ‘death of distance’ (Cairncross, 2001). ICT-enabled coordination is only effective when linked with other mechanisms such as expatriates and face-to-face contacts. Furthermore, the chapter shows that national culture characteristics appear to be more dynamic and less homogenous than the existing literature suggests. ICTs act as an arena where organizational culture change is often expressed.	expert system	Wei Liu;Chris Westrup	2003			multinational corporation;economic growth;china;icts;business;economic system	HCI	-78.27071558548182	3.3697018842752122	195589

The issues raised are often insufficiently attended to by practitioners who are attempting to build technological information and knowledge management systems. The driver for the paper is that despite impressive advances in technology and its now almost ubiquitous presence in organisations, as well as academic study over several decades, many of the benefits originally expected concerning improved data, information, and knowledge sharing have not materialised as expected. Basic reasons for this lie in the lack of attention to the cultural foundations of organisations and because matters relating to organisational power and political matters are often misunderstood, overlooked, or ignored. These different perspectives are discussed and contrasted in order to tease out the important differences between them and assess the prospects for a synthesis. It is concluded that while there are important commonalities between the two perspectives there are also fundamental differences, notably regarding what are causes and what are effects and, therefore, how to go about effecting change regarding data, information, and knowledge sharing.	information;knowledge management	Dennis Hart;Leoni Warne	2006	IJKM	10.4018/jkm.2006040101	public relations;economics;computer science;knowledge management;management science;management;culture;hierarchy	HCI	-78.49320832312357	-1.6195084482388893	195602

We conducted a longitudinal case study in a large mental health institute where an attempt was made to transform the mission and profile of the IT function. To orient our case analysis, we combined a typology of IT function archetypes with key concepts from institutional theory. By focusing on key actors’ motives, actions, and decisions, our theoretical propositions suggest, among others, that institutional work that reflects all the three pillars of rules, norms, and meaning are necessary in order to successfully create and maintain an envisioned IT function archetype. Implications of our findings for both theory and practice are discussed.

Certain types of data are more likely to be accessed and utilized by organization members when they prefer working with it. The value and usefulness of data is therefore partially determined by the desire of individuals to use it. Because critical data may not be in a preferred format, it can be overlooked or ignored by some organizational members. Moreover, organizational members may also rely too heavily on their favored types of data. Thus, inappropriate access and use of data can occur within organizational decision making. This can result in ineffective decision-making and poor organizational performance. The purpose of this study is to propose relationships between the users of both tacit and explicit knowledge and their preferred cognitive style and to test these proposed relationships using empirical data.

Power plays of optimization and mastery illustrate each identity.

For example, they can overestimate or underestimate the counterpart's commitment to their relationship. In the business-to-business (B2B) literature, the consequences of such inaccurate perceptions have not been empirically investigated. We advance and test the proposition that the impact of misreading the other party's relational closeness depends on the direction of the error. We propose that overestimating the counterpart's relational closeness (CRC) is beneficial, while underestimating the counterpart's relational closeness is detrimental for the relationship's functioning. Using original dyadic data in the service sector, we show that most companies underestimate their CRC, in which case becoming perceptually more accurate would improve their relationships. But the opposite holds for parties that overestimate their CRC, in which case becoming perceptually more accurate would actually make the relationship deteriorate. Furthermore, we show that even in long-standing relationships, companies do not know how accurate their perceptions are, even when they believe that they correctly perceive their CRC. We discuss managerial implications of our findings and encourage future research to determine why most decision makers underestimate their CRC, which can lead to impaired functioning of B2B relationships.

However, most KM concepts, practices, and tools have mainly been developed and studied in the private sector and there is a lack of understanding of KM in public organizations. This paper addresses the gap by discussing the differences between public and private organizations in their KM endeavors. Specifically, KM drivers in the context of public organizations are first identified. Salient KM enablers and how they may differentially affect the success of KM initiatives in public and private organizations are then discussed. Finally, tools for assessing KM performance in public organizations are suggested, in view of their unique organizational objectives.	knowledge management	Loo Geok Pee;Atreyi Kankanhalli	2008		10.1145/1509096.1509188	public relations;knowledge management;environmental resource management;public sector;business	Web+IR	-79.5257353330962	-0.07779160858886726	196801

Although BPR has been studied for some decades, additional issues have come into existence recently, e.g., balance of efficiency and internal control (including information security management), organization reform or enterprise integration including the causes of recent economic circumstances. Analyses in this paper are aimed at addressing these issues. By clarifying the mechanism for achieving BPR effectiveness, analysis is focused on organization perspectives and communication infrastructure.	business process;customer relationship management;enterprise information system;enterprise integration;information systems;information security;security management	Kayo Iizuka;Yasuki Iizuka;Kazuhiko Tsuda	2010			business analysis;business transformation;business process reengineering;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;process modeling;management science;business process model and notation;process management;business system planning;business process;business relationship management;business process discovery;management;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	AI	-79.91624007332199	1.4084162767932318	196816

However, in rea lity few of the potential benefits are actually leverage d. Even those organizations that have succeeded in establishing online service delivery often fail in transformational aspects such as service orientatio n and a networked organizational structure. This pape r adds to the theoretical body of Transformational Government by a longitudinal study of barriers to I T-driven change in a European Customs organization. In a first workshop we identified six ty-two potential barriers, which were later assesse d to understand their impact on the transformation pr ocess. Our findings show that some of the barriers could not be controlled within the project, thereby framing the ‘window of opportunity’ and determining the outcome of the transformation proce ss. We also found differences in the importance of overcoming the barriers and in the mechanisms that influenced organizational transformation.	framing (world wide web);itil;online service provider;resources, events, agents (accounting model);wilhelm pape	Stefan Henningsson;Anne Fleur van Veenstra	2010			public relations;e-government;computer science;world wide web;economic system	HCI	-79.15402009368267	1.0187344484760197	197026

This research responds to the high numbers of IS projects that are seen to have failed in terms of either one or many success criteria such as: not meeting original objectives, running over budget, negatively impacting on people, processes or organizations, to name but a few. We advocate the need for the development of a more rigorous evidence base for IS research similar to those used in medicine or more recently in social studies and software engineering. For example, Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) and also Meta-Analysis of empirical research studies could be used more extensively within IS to compile more coherent, consistent and referable bodies of evidence and knowledge. We conclude with a 7 point action plan and suggestions for further research.		Briony June Oates;David W. Wainwright;Helen M.

774695bcc96d1e0c4912f29bea4ae53da38ad2f9	it consultants in acquisition it integration - a resource-based view	consultants;resource based view;it integration;acquisition;merger	Increasingly, companies are drawing on capacities provided by external consultants to design and execute strategic IT initiatives. However, despite evidence of the impact of such services on IT performance, little is still known about the roles external consultants serve in relation to specific strategic IT initiatives and how companies can draw effectively on their services. This paper investigates the use of consultants in relation to one type of major strategic IT initiative: acquisition IT integration. Acquisition IT integration, which is the integration of the acquirer’s and target’s IT following a corporate acquisition, presents a difficult but crucial IT challenge for the many acquiring organizations. Through a comparative case study of four acquirers, theoretically grounded in the resource-based view of the firm, we analyse how acquirers draw on external consultants to realize acquisition IT integration. We identify two complementary and two supplementary roles consultants assume in these projects. Additionally, we identify three characteristics of the acquisition IT integration strategy that influence how the acquirers assign different roles to IT consultants. The resulting model, depicting the use of external consultants in acquisition IT integration, contributes to the literature on acquisition IT integration by providing an explanation for IT-based value creation in acquisition that is rooted in the external of the acquirer. In addition to adding to the limited, but highly relevant, extant literature on acquisition IT integration, the study also provides general insights into the use of consultants to address strategic IT initiatives.	acquiring bank	Stefan Henningsson;Christian Øhrgaard	2016	Business & Information Systems Engineering	10.1007/s12599-016-0433-5	economics;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;military acquisition;management	HCI	-79.6737549470229	3.5418074389159218	199165
77a9a280a2a0d6515ce16bd3b57853ad50278ed1	on the impact of the 'linguistic turn' on research in information systems	knowledge management;enterprise systems;philosophy;hermeneutics	The linguistic turn within philosophy has recently gained increased attention within social sciences. It can be seen as an attempt to investigate traditional philosophical problems by analysing the linguistic expressions used for these investigations. More generally, the phenomenon of language itself must be considered because of its (constitutional) impact on the investigation of phenomena in social sciences. In order to understand the consequences of the linguistic turn, its origins in philosophy are important and will be discussed. Within social sciences the linguistic turn already had significant impact. As an example, we will therefore discuss what directions the linguistic turn enabled for organizational analysis. Information Systems as a discipline must face the consequences of the linguistic turn as well. We will discuss how the linguistic framework introduced impacts the development of knowledge management and that of managerial and organizational support systems. This example shows what different perspectives the linguistic turn can provide for investigations within Information Systems. In addition, we will briefly outline the impact of the linguistic turn with respect to methodologies in Information Systems research.	enterprise resource planning;enterprise system;information systems research;information system;knowledge management	Alexander Dreiling	2006			knowledge management;natural language processing;information system;artificial intelligence;linguistic turn;computer science	NLP	-77.94116293841454	-1.9447197410856032	199227

Applying these models, research studies were conducted that identify a host of factors impacting these key antecedents of IT acceptance. The results from this research have not been synthesized to determine factors that repeatedly emerge as key antecedents of acceptance. Secondly, can these key factors be influenced via training, such that it eventually improves acceptance? In this research, we first survey research that applies acceptance theories. From this, we synthesize those key factors that can be influenced through training programs. Then, drawing upon theories in other disciplines, we identify training methods that can positively enhance these factors. This linking and integration of research results will help us consolidate the cumulative knowledge gained from IT acceptance research, and provide a framework to help design more acceptance-centric training programs.
