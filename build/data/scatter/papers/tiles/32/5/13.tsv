Acceptance of electronic journals among business school faculty has two hurdles to overcome: technological and, more challenging, garnering legitimacy within the academic community. A survey targeted at business school faculty in the United States was conducted investigating faculty perceptions about the acceptance of electronic journals in their academic discipline. The findings suggest that at the time of publication, electronic publications were seen as less desirable than paper counterparts for tenure and review. However, it appears that electronic counterparts of existing journals would maintain their legitimacy from a promotion and tenure perspective, suggesting that the perceived legitimacy of the journal is the critical hurdle to overcome.

Digital government may in many ways be even more critical for tribes than for many other governments. As sovereign nations, tribal governments are engaged in complex relationships with other governments: local, state and federal governments. They are frequently in geographically isolated locations, with often-dispersed populations. The capacity to bridge distance can convey benefits for service delivery and civic engagement, and can connect communities with resources for health, economic development, and education. In this paper, we review research on Native American technology use and the limitations of available data. Because of the contrast between residents of urban areas and tribal lands, we examine differences in cell phone, computer and Internet use for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan Native populations, by education and income. We propose a research agenda utilizing this data, to support action to remedy disparities and to harness the potential of technology for tribal governments.	e-government;itil;internet;mobile phone;population	Nicholet Deschine Parkhurst;Traci Morris;Emery Tahy;Karen Mossberger	2015		10.1145/2757401.2757424	public relations;political science;public administration;economic growth	HCI	-79.56718325249119	-10.002565932702677	169562
8365e4751831b7df864ec7f01600e73f9d9c20b2	linking user profiles in social networks: a comparative review		The existence of user profiles belonging to a single user across different social networking sites poses several challenges to the research community. The main technical issue in that context is to detect the same user profiles across several different social networks by leveraging a set of mechanisms that identify the similarity among the user profiles. This problem is commonly referred to as entity matching or identity linkage on social networks. In this review, we describe and compare the 27 most important (to the best of our knowledge) research papers in this area. The main contributions of this article are to provide a systematic and integrated review of papers in this area, to provide comparative points that simplify the understanding of such systems, and finally to discuss future research avenues.	social network;user profile	Hussein Hazimeh;Elena Mugellini;Omar Abou Khaled;Philippe Cudré-Mauroux	2017	IJSNM	10.1504/IJSNM.2017.10012932	knowledge management;social network;business	ECom	-78.80966779857974	-16.899077431940565	169838

E-participation has gained popularity in many countries, and some cases have shown that e-participation has actually brought significant changes in societies. In this panel, we address two issues: (1) the impacts of eparticipation on society, and (2) the role of information science in understanding this phenomenon. We will focus on introducing emerging trends in e-participation and their impact on individuals and societies in South Korea, the United States, and Honduras. Further, we introduce methods for efficiently analyzing e-participation data, and discuss challenges involved in implementing these methodologies. Because this is intended to be an interactive panel, the audience will be encouraged to engage in discussions and contributing their own experiences and ideas related to current trends in e-participation in various countries.

As work and technology use become increasingly intertwined, a number of issues deserve re-examination. Some of these relate to work intensification and/or longer hours and possible exchange for flexibility. Recent research on use of employer-supplied smart phones offers some insight into employee perceptions of why the company supplies this technology and whether there is risk to declining the opportunity. Because dangers are more readily apparent, current limitations of technology use have been approached more often through laws related to driving than through general policies or regulation about the work itself. However, there are other concerns that may translate into employer liability beyond the possibility of car accidents. A variety of these concerns are covered in this article, along with related suggestion for actions by employers, their advisory groups, technology companies, government and employees themselves.	dark side;smartphone	Gayle Porter	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society	10.1109/ISTAS.2010.5514609	public relations;operations management;advertising;business	Embedded	-79.22024319783127	-10.79485968146372	170204

It analyses the motivation and technical viability of these fears and derives suggestions for privacyfriendly technology design. The analysis shows that all consumer fears currently debated are essentially justified, because from a technical perspective they can all be implemented in the shortor mid-term. A 7-point plan of technological measures is presented that should be taken into consideration and developed further by standardization bodies, researchers and governments in order to impede potential abuses of the technology in the long term.	radio-frequency identification	Sarah Spiekermann;Holger Ziekow	2005			radio-frequency identification;public relations;computer science;information security;marketing;management;privacy;law;world wide web;computer security;commerce	HCI	-78.56527124194596	-9.928804251370652	171202
d2e7ea094488e66af3f4a51b7d2bd66cf6949bfb	governing the historical city: transformation is necessary to counteract the further waste of extra-urban land		The safeguarding of building heritage identity is motivated by three important attributes that are: the complexity of its physical-architectural characteristics; the richness of its articulation; and the socio-economic, environmental, and landscape interdependencies inherent to it. However, the ancient built environment must also measure itself against an increasingly pressing necessity for adjustment to the needs of work and living environments. Furthermore, it is challenged to do so in such a way that reduces the wasteful use of extra-urban land by redirecting urban transformations back within the existing city [15]. The map of intervenibility on heritage, proposed in this work, thus represents a technical response, assisted by multivariate geostatistics and Geographic Information Systems. It responds to the necessity to reach a synthesis that – after examination of the effects of urban history on contemporary places – identifies its virtues and contradictions. Thus, the map suggests the degree and modes of building interventions through a multidimensional classification of real estate by cultural value, visual field, urban morphology/typology, structural quality, and form of open spaces.	biconnected component;biological anthropology;galaxy morphological classification;geographic information system;interdependence;physical symbol system;urban computing	Pier Luigi Paolillo;Massimo Rossati;Mattia Andrea Rudini	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09147-1_10	artificial intelligence	HCI	-78.300963467357	-12.478461163689486	171868

Within this new trend in social commerce, Instagram, a simple yet powerful app, is now playing a new role in combining both the advantage of social networks with its design features and capabilities. In this paper we examine how a simple yet powerful picture-based social network app like Instagram is shaping the electronic commerce arena globally, using Kuwait as an example. Instagram has become a major part of most Kuwaiti individual lives, for in Kuwait Instagram is currently an hourly stop instead of a daily one. Instagram transformed from being a voyeuristic tool to becoming a handy shopping outlet. Everything from exotic pets to home car washing and detailing service can be found on Instagram, whose usage in Kuwait is now ubiquitous: from the old widower selling home-cooked traditional dishes to multimillion real estate investment companies. In this paper we explore the factors and barriers that helped Instagram become a social commerce outlet for many users in Kuwait and around the world.	e-commerce;exploratory testing;handy board;instagram;noise shaping;social commerce;social network;the cathedral and the bazaar	Omer Gibreel;Dhari A.

A central challenge for the social network analysis is the identification of key persons within a social network. In this context, the article aims at presenting the current state of research on centrality measures for social networks. In view of highly variable findings about the quality of various centrality measures, we also illustrate the tremendous importance of a reflected utilization of existing centrality measures. For this purpose, the paper analyzes five common centrality measures on the basis of three simple requirements for the behavior of centrality measures.	centrality;requirement;social network analysis;web application	Andrea Landherr;Bettina Friedl;Julia Heidemann	2010	Business & Information Systems Engineering	10.1007/s12599-010-0127-3	public relations;social network analysis;viral marketing;interconnectedness;management science;social network	Web+IR	-79.45105123804997	-16.89690066976361	172687

This article argues that while the vigorous profusion of web-based citizen media has the potential to inaugurate an era of dynamic expansion of the deliberative space and even serve as a counterfoil to the suffocating dominance of the discursive space by the traditional, mainstream media, we are now witnessing a trend toward the aggressive cooptation of these citizen media by corporate media hegemons. To demonstrate this, I study ‘iReport.com,’ a YouTube-type, user-generated citizen news site launched by the Cable News Network (CNN). I argue that the trend toward corporate-sponsored citizen media may, in the final analysis, blur the distinction between citizen and mainstream journalism.	digital journalism;user-generated content;web application	Farooq A.

5a3db114575d2926df10786d48bc4f7f215e7815	do retweets indicate interest, trust, agreement? (extended abstract)		Arguably one of the most important features of Twitter is the support for“retweets”or messages re-posted verbatim by a user that were originated by someone else. (This does not include modified tweets that sometimes are referred to as retweets.) Despite the fact that retweets are routinely studied and reported, many important questions remain about user motivation for their use and their significance. In this paper we answer the question of what users indicate when they retweet. We do so in a comprehensive fashion, by employing a user survey, a study of user profiles, and a metaanalysis of over 100 research publications from three related major conferences. Our findings indicate that retweeting indicates not only interest in a message, but also trust in the message and the originator, and agreement with the message contents. However, the findings are significantly weaker for journalists, some of whom beg to differ declaring so in their own user profiles. On the other hand, the inclusion of hashtags strengthens the signal of agreement, especially when the hashtags are related to politics. While in the past there have been additional claims in the literature about possible reasons for retweeting, many of them are not supported, especially given the technical changes introduced recently by Twitter.	hashtag;reblogging;user profile	Panagiotis Takis Metaxas;Eni Mustafaraj;Kily Wong;Laura Zeng;Megan O'Keefe;Samantha Finn	2014	CoRR		computer science;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-84.31403326546669	-16.33717679868574	174891

This article investigates how contributions by Thai women to internet discussions function simultaneously to renegotiate and reinscribe conceptions of nation, gender and community formation. It focuses on the Thai-managed, English language website SiamWEB.org (www.siamweb.org). The existence of this forum enables conversations between visitors that would otherwise not take place, providing a space for Thai women to respond to these dominant images. The article discusses SiamWEB.org’s strategic use of English, the in-process subject-position assumed of participants, and the persistent refusal of accepted conventions circumscribing national membership. Finally, it analyzes visitor responses, concluding that SiamWEB.org ‘remaps’ and redefines participants’ online identities, Thailand’s national borders, and the tenets of nationa...

Analysing a sample of employed business professionals, representative of the service industry located within the metropolitan section of Pittsburgh, PA, a major corporate headquarters revealed a number of significant gender differences when considering the myriad operational and ethical issues associated RFID-related implementations, especially concerning microchip implants. Overall, male business professionals had a perceived greater awareness of RFID-related technological applications, while females were more concerned about job loss due to such technological innovations, local government has more control over technological innovations, and felt that such technology was useful in reducing the threat of personal identity theft. In general, most respondents felt that RFID-embedded microchip implants were potentially important in dealing with effectively dealing with criminal elements in society and keeping domesticated animals safe, but generally felt that too many potential issues associated with commercial and governmental misuse exists in order to allow for widespread, unregulated implementations into society.	3d scanner;embedded system;integrated circuit;microchip implant (animal);microchip implant (human);personally identifiable information;radio-frequency identification	Alan D.

This bias creates the wisdom of ad-hoc crowds or the wisdom of a few. Although it is well known that user activity in most settings follows a power law, that is, few people do a lot, while most do nothing, there are few studies that characterize well this activity. In a recent analysis of social network data we corroborated that a small percentage of the active users (passive users are the majority) represent at least the 50% of the UGC. This implies that most of the wisdom comes from a few users, which is not that surprising, as the Web is a reflection of our own society, where economical or political power also is in the hands of minorities.	hoc (programming language);long tail;social network;the wisdom of crowds;user-generated content;web content;world wide web	Ricardo A.

Seven municipality Web site genres are identified: notice-board, newspaper, brochure, promotion, commercial, portal, and filter. We discuss how the municipality genres are related to each other, and to other genres, as mix-genres or subgenres. We conclude that the genres differ widely in terms of form, dominating content, action possibilities, purposes, and user groups and roles. This paper provides design examples of what qualities the different genres might bring, and thereby, gives an opportunity for designers and procurers to learn from previous designs. The paper contributes both by providing an analysis of a genre central to society, and by showing how a genre analysis reveals implicit values regarding the user and the task, mediated in the genres of municipality Web sites.	norm (social);world wide web	Emma Eliason;Jonas Lundberg	2006		10.1145/1182475.1182481	multimedia	HCI	-82.95192580696178	-15.322407415103022	176393

The discrepancy between the growing expectation of greater democratic participation through the use of Internet resources, and the discouraging reality of the promotion of inequality through the lack of the use of a gender-based analysis, has resulted in growing tension over information/communications technology (ICT) resource allocation.

Earthquakes in Eastern Mediterranean region denote a major hazard. It is well known that this area hosts very complex active tectonics, accommodates major seismic sources and suffers from many deadly earthquakes. One of the main challenges after a mass disaster event is the care for the directly or indirectly affected population, gathering rapidly in great numbers at specific areas. For the appropriate organization of the emergency shelters, components such as coordination, communication and medical care are considered very important. The medical needs of evacuees must be identified and appropriate care and support must be provided. This paper presents the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) developed to support emergency services and temporary accommodation in order to speed up the initial procedures and improve the provided help to the affected people.	contingency plan;hazard (computer architecture)	Vasilis Kontogiannis;Dimitris Manousos;Ioannis Karatzanis;Panagiotis Argyropaidas;Angelina Kouroubali	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Disaster Management (ICT-DM)	10.1109/ICT-DM.2017.8275688	environmental planning;information and communications technology;accommodation;population	Robotics	-78.7638989614387	-10.165691651273132	178382

ICT for development (ICT4D) interventions have been undertaken that address these specific factors of marginalization, however, it remains that communities are still excluded from the global knowledge society. In this paper we argue that key factors towards reaching greater inclusion and participation of the digitally marginalized communities, are the knowledge-centricity and context-sensitivity of the undertaken interventions. The solutions developed, and the services deployed, must intrinsically encapsulate the local knowledge within the community of deployment. Based on this premise we have developed an architectural framework, named PIASK, that formalizes the contextualization of the developed applications within the socio-technical environment and positions them within the local knowledge system of the community. We highlight the components of this architecture and discuss its implementation through a knowledge platform for a community in South Africa.	enterprise architecture framework;internet;knowledge society;knowledge-based systems;sociotechnical system;software deployment	Mamello Thinyane;Alfredo Terzoli	2009	2009 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Innovations for Digital Inclusions		geography;knowledge management;management science;multimedia	HCI	-79.83728335913875	-10.7444791804498	178402

Its original aim was to limit unauthorized access to centralized systems, but the rise of social networks like Facebook has changed that. Now each person wants to control who sees photos or makes comments on their local wall by making and unmaking friends, i.e. dynamic, distributed rights control. Social networks already have access control, but there is currently no agreed logical model for their rights, no consistent scheme for allocating and re-allocating permissions to create, edit, delete and view social objects and entities. A socio-technical approach based on social and technical requirements can give the basics of a model. Various rights reallocations like multiply, divide, transfer and delegate are explored. It suggests a theoretical base for access control beyond its security parent.	access control;authorization;centralized computing;entity;requirement;social network;social objects;sociotechnical system;software system	Adnan Ahmad;Brian Whitworth;Lech J.

Based on the accounts of 30 young people aged between 11 and 17, the article adopts a social constructivist perspective to explore the relationship between young people’s talk of sexuality and sexual acts in their discussions of mobile phone use, within the wider theoretical debates about risk and self-identity.	mobile phone	Emma Bond	2011	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444810377919	gender studies;risk;human sexuality;communication;social psychology	HCI	-79.00456941117302	-13.390861546301736	179870

Various new research initiatives under the label """"urban informatics"""" have been started since then by universities (e.g., NYU's Center for Urban Science and Progress) and industry (e.g., Arup, McKinsey) worldwide. Yet, many of these new initiatives are limited to what Townsend calls, """"data-driven approaches to urban improvement"""" [2].

To examine how humanists are adopting Ebooks, we focus on the first stage, the Knowledge Phase, of Rogers’ model of the diffusion of innovations. Central to this stage is the study of adopter attitudes toward the innovation and the role played by social networks in the adoption process. Historians were selected as the population of study because of their close relationship to the printed book, both as a research tool and as an academic goal. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with historians and then analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Our preliminary results show that historians had both positive and negative attitudes towards the Ebook. Often the same person showed eagerness and curiosity to adopt certain features of Ebooks whilst showing some degree of reluctance and skepticism. We identified the Role of the Social Network (RSN) as an important factor in the decision-making process of historians. Respondents frequently mentioned the subject specialist librarian for history as a key source of information. In addition, historians went not only to peers inside of the department, but also to friends and colleagues elsewhere when seeking advice on working with Ebooks. As Ebooks gain ground within academia, studies such as this, that focus on a single discipline, will be necessary to understand why scholars make the decision to adopt or reject. The study results found that subject librarians can act as change agents on the university campus. For this reason, the impact they have on the use of new technologies by academics needs further attention.	digital humanities;e-book;ieee 802.11i-2004;information source;librarian;printing;semiconductor industry;social network;while	Anabel Quan-Haase;Kim Martin	2011		10.1002/meet.2011.14504801128	social science;computer science;multimedia;sociology;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-80.15051487210832	-15.85710076379914	182303

The aim is to contribute to the understanding of the features of formal and informal e-petition platforms as well as the characteristics of the e-petitions. A formal (kansalaisaloite. fi) and an informal e-petition platform (adressit.com) in Finland were compared using quantitative content analysis. By examining the differences between formal and informal platforms, this paper sheds light over citizens’ political behavior in the form of online petitioning. The varying formality of the platforms was reflected in their features and e-petitioning processes. Furthermore, formal and informal e-petitions differed regarding their initiators, text length, topics, preparation quality, rationality, affectivity and connections to other types of media. E-petitions on the formal platform are better prepared, show more signs of rational argumentation, and more often concern controversial topics.

Social networking services (SNSs) have become one of the most representative means. General SNSs allow users to create their own unique profiles, search for fellow members, share information, etc., while other SNSs have functions that cater to different needs of users. As a result, users of SNSs have begun to pick and choose different SNSs and concurrently use multiple SNSs in order to fulfill all their needs. This exploratory study examined which SNSs are used together and the characteristics that predict the use of multiple SNSs. In addition, it observed the differences between consumers’ usage of multiple SNSs in different cultures. An online survey was administered to SNS users in the United States and Korea. The results of the study showed that the use of multiple SNSs is not yet prevalent in Korea, the country that represented a collectivistic culture. In addition, in the U.S., the highest number of users reported that they were active on at least three SNSs.

The authors also studied how online strategies are implemented and executed in three different periods, namely pre-elections, a crisis period (in the authors’ case the Greek sovereign debt crisis) and a ‘normal’ period. To answer the authors’ research questions the authors adapted a social media conceptual framework to online political presence. Data was collected via in-depth interviews with candidates of 5 different political parties taking part in the general elections of 2012. The authors’ analysis suggests that although politicians are increasingly interested in engaging with citizens via online technologies, their efforts are not always focused on achieving measurable and tangible results. Politicians’ online strategies need to be organised around the concepts of communication, engagement and influence and not around the electronic spaces where these take place, i.e. the objectives and the means need to be clearly distinguished and utilised. The authors discuss the implications of their findings from a theoretical and practical perspective, in the context of online political marketing and political participation and engagement.

Cheat websites that are a prominent part of the game culture and industry have been debated because of their illegitimate nature but received little attention in terms of their educational value. In this paper we analyze the cheat sites created by players for a teen virtual world called Whyville.net, which encourages youth ages 8-16 to participate in a range of social activities and play casual science games. Analysis of a sample of 257 cheat sites resulted in typologies for both the cheats and sites in terms of quality and quantity of science content. A case study of an especially active cheat site and analysis of player-written articles in Whyville's newspaper illuminate the illegitimate and legitimate aspects of cheating in this virtual world. Implications of these findings as cultural artifacts of the game community and as guides for designing informal online learning activities are discussed.	virtual world	Deborah A. Fields;Yasmin B.

Historically television broadcasting was the main source of revenue for elite sports teams, leagues and sports federations. This is now changing because the Internet creates new possibilities for the distribution and consumption of sporting events. Social media is creating new forms of communication between fans, athletes, teams and sponsors. Mobile technology is also changing the way that fans consume sports content generally and also at live events. These changes create many strategic challenges and opportunities. This case study presents several frameworks and ideas, in particular the sports ecosystem model, event-driven marketing, star marketing and international differences in sports viewing for specific sports. These concepts are illustrated using sports marketing data from ComScore, individual sports organisations and personal research. A framework for the development of a social media strategy is proposed that can be used to evaluate the current position of a sports organisation and also to facilitate the development of a social media strategy. A series of questions is posed to structure the discussion of the strategic and technology issues facing the commercial director of a major sports team.	ecosystem model;event-driven programming;internet;outline of television broadcasting;social media	Christopher Patrick Holland	2015			public relations;digital marketing;marketing management;ecosystem model;marketing;media management;advertising;sports marketing	HCI	-82.18139977562201	-13.109893549768351	184002

Drawing from a content analysis of 500 U.S. city websites from two points in time, we examine the prevalence and growth of ICTs used b y municipalities ranging in population from 25,000 to 250,000 from 2010 to 2014. We present the results of the content analysis, outlining the prevalence of five categories of ICTs – information tools, e-services, utility, transparency, and civic engagement features and investigating how type of ICT adoption is related to city size, form of government, and technical capacity. We then rank the 500 cities based on 27 ICT features and note how those rankings have changed over the four-year period. We conclude with a discussion of municipal use of ICTs and what this means for governments and the communities they serve. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	e-services	Mary K.

In particular, the inherent socio-technical attribu tes of computer-mediated communication (CMC), such as online open forums, chat rooms and blogs pr ovide a novel opportunity for offering personalized health information and social support. However, to date, little research has been carried out to assess this context and this paper is aimed at a dressing this lacuna, thereby providing cleare r understanding of this complicated phenomenon and it s in rinsic elements. To achieve this, we conducted a case study in an online open forum comp osed of a number of chat rooms used for communication about health issues, mainly depressio n.

By analyzing content and form characteristics of two leading portal sites—MSN and Yahoo!—on 33 and 23 (respectively) of their local country homepages in a comparative and longitudinal study over a period of six months, this study addresses two research questions: What differences, if any, are found among homepages of the same parent site located in different cultures (or targeted at audiences in different cultures)? What trends, if any, do those differences show over time? Although MSN is a U.S. brand, the analysis of its homepages reveals increasing cultural heterogeneity and localization of content and form. In contrast, Yahoo!’s homepages are found to be more similar to each other and to the ‘‘parent’’ American portal. A metric was developed to measure the distance between various websites in terms of form and content, along with a structured procedure to analyze and cluster groups of websites. The results suggest that the diversity of local homepages in MSN and Yahoo! follows the geographic and ethnographic scatter of their countries.	cyberspace;internet	Elad Segev;Niv Ahituv;Karine Nahon	2007	J.

It is subject to experimental tests that are replicated by independent parts. Given the huge amount of information available and the information asymetry between producers and users of knowledge, scientists have to rely on the reports of others. This makes it possible for social effects to influence the scientific community. Here, an Opinion Dynamics agent model is proposed to describe this situation. The influence of Nature through experiments is described as an external field that acts on the experimental agents. We will see that the retirement of old scientists can be fundamental in the acceptance of a new theory. We will also investigate the interplay between social influence and observations. This will allow us to gain insight in the problem of when social effects can have negligible effects in the conclusions of a scientific community and when we should worry about them.		André C. R.

However, it is unclear as to whether the users of such collection are fully aware of the potential privacy implications of submitting their personal contents (e.g. photographs, video, etc.) to these digital collections. They may even hold misconceptions of the technological support for preserving their privacy. In this paper we present results from 18 auto-ethnographic investigations and 19 ethnographic observations and interviews into privacy issues that arise when people make their personal photo collections available online. The Adams’ privacy model is used to discuss the findings according to information sensitivity, information receiver, and information usage. Further issues of trust and ad hoc poorly supported protection strategies are also presented. Ultimately while photographic data is potentially highly sensitive, the privacy risks are often hidden and the protection mechanisms are limited.	digital photography;e-commerce;hoc (programming language);information sensitivity;interaction design;international standard serial number;privacy;protection mechanism	Sally Jo Cunningham;Masood Masoodian;Anne Adams	2010	JTAER		privacy software;information privacy;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-83.03551357611035	-12.390820474917232	186652

Three pillars for Open Government are outlined in the document and consist of transparency, participation and collaboration which form the foundation for the initiative. Here we report on a case study, where the use of social media by the United States Department of Agriculture was assessed in relation to the agencies implementation of goals set by the Open Government Initiative. In the Open Government Initiative, the use of social media features strongly as a means to connect with the public and to promote the three pillars. We question whether use of social actually results in realization of the three pillars, but with a particular focus on dialogue between the USDA and the public. We apply a mixed-methods approach based in grounded theory, social network analysis, content analysis and discourse analysis. Early findings suggest that although the USDA is mentioned there is no clear evidence of discourse, in the sense of exchange of tweets between the USDA and other posters. This is assuming that anyone who may post from the USDA would do so under the auspices of the organization and not as an individual with a unique user name. Our research indicates that traditional definitions of these terms (transparency, collaboration and participation) may need to be expanded to account for the types of interactions occurring via social media. In this paper, we report on our research plan and initial observations."	directive (programming);e-government;social media	Kristene Unsworth;Adam Townes	2012		10.1002/meet.14504901298	social science;e-government;social media;computer science;sociology;law;world wide web	NLP	-79.62324940281128	-15.321839875196241	186813

Research questions: How do pitchers acquire frames for pitches? How do pitchers apply frames to existing pitches? How do pitchers gauge the fit between the innovation, frames, and stakeholders? Literature review: The literature examined-framing professional communication, developing pitches, and framing pitches-stresses the relationship between framing, agency, and deliberation. However, few studies approach data from the perspective of the pitcher and few frames outside of the problem-solution frame are considered. Methodology: This autoethnography analyzes data from more than 500 pages of field notes, 60 minutes of video-recorded pitch sessions, 25 interviews with pitch stakeholders, and various textual artifacts that pertained to Author 1's nonprofit startup organization, Hacker Gals. Themes in the data were identified and analyzed through the composition of analytic memos. Frames were identified and analyzed through close reading and holistic interpretation. Results and conclusions: The entrepreneur acquired the most influential frames through stakeholder discussion, applied these frames in a way that stacked and made salient multiple frames beyond the problem-solution frame, and judged frame fit by considering the degree to which catchers took up the frames. The study's results suggest that the practice of frame stacking might increase pitch effectiveness by mitigating troubled identifications.	framing (world wide web);hacker;holism;stacking	Stacy J.

This paper examines the FMD pages of four local government websites in Northern England: Cumbria, Durham, Northumberland and North Yorkshire County Councils. Each county was badly affected by FMD. The contents of the FMD webpages are analysed and compared: which audiences were addressed, what information was provided or omitted, and how well the audiences’ needs were met. The study shows the breadth of audience types and information that could have been included, but no site covered all the necessary angles. Furthermore, the websites did little to address the psychological problems arising from FMD or to enhance participation and democracy in their local communities. By examining how the councils informed those affected, lessons can be learnt which are relevant to any future disruption to a community.	clickable;computer;denial-of-service attack;intel developer forum	Briony J.

9f14c7203f7d538f320dab5153eaf717187ef634	pluralistic ignorance in the personal use of the internet and system monitoring	pluralistic ignorance;social norm	Previous research suggests that computer security countermeasures would be effective in preventing computer abuse in organizations. However, computer abuse problems still persist despite these efforts. This study proposes a new model of computer abuse that explains a causal link between abusive behavior and a psychological state toward this behavior, drawn on the theory of pluralistic ignorance. Pluralistic ignorance is a form of erroneous social interference that is both an immediate cause and a consequence of literal inconsistency between private attitudes and public behavior. Under pluralistic ignorance, mistakenly perceived social norms overwhelm personal attitudes and subsequently lead to overt behavior contrary to an actor’s attitude. This new model contributes to the theoretical body of knowledge on computer abuse by providing a new angle for approaching the problem. In addition, it suggests to practitioners that social solutions should be considered, along with technical countermeasures, to reduce the pervasive computer abuse problems.	americas conference on information systems;causality;computer security;cybercrime;interference (communication);internet;literal (mathematical logic);mental state;norm (social);pervasive informatics;pluralistic ignorance;situated cognition;system monitoring	Jongheon Kim;Zoonky Lee;Seong No Yoon	2005			the internet;computer science;body of knowledge;system monitoring;pluralistic ignorance;social psychology;socioeconomics;norm (social);countermeasure	Security	-82.60556461796055	-13.337153454631268	189968

The purpose of this paper is to understand whether the brand personality of an online brand community, rather than of the brand itself, can be deduced from the online communication within that brand community.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThe paper is empirical in nature. The authors use community-generated content from eight online brand communities and perform content analysis using the text analysis software Diction. The authors employ the five brand personality dictionaries (competence, excitement, ruggedness, sincerity and sophistication) from the Pitt et al. (2007) dictionary source as the basis for the authors’ analysis.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe paper offers two main contributions. First, it identifies two types of communities: those focusing on solving functional problems that consumers might encounter with a firm’s offering and those focusing on broader engagement with the brand. Second, the study serves as a blueprint that marketers can adopt to analyze online brand communities using a computerized approach. Such a blueprint is beneficial not only to analyze a firm’s own online brand community but also that of competitors, thus providing insights into how their brand stacks up against competitor brands.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThis is the first paper examining the nature of online brand communities by means of computerized content analysis. The authors outline a number of areas that marketing scholars could explore further based on the authors analysis.

Both cut across the duality global/national and each has altered the economic and political landscapes for respectively financial elites and social activists. Using these two cases helps illuminate the very diverse ways in which the growth of electronic networks partially transforms existing politico-economic orderings. They are extreme cases, one marked by hypermobility and the other by physical immobility. But they show us that each is only partly so: financial electronic networks are subject to particular types of embeddedness and local activist organizations can benefit from novel electronic potentials for global operation. I show how financial electronic networks and electronic activism reveal two parallel developments associated with particular technical properties of the new ICTs, but also reveal a third, radically divergent outcome, one I interpret as signaling the weight of the specific social logics of users in each case.	sociotechnical system	Saskia Sassen	2012			engineering;artificial intelligence;management	ML	-79.8499569231797	-12.646555528707133	190378

While we might question whether demographic categories are the most useful way to track Internet use, it’s clear that these categories are dominant in conversations about the digital divide. In this paper, we will follow that thread to look at the digital divide for the category of seniors, based on our year-long study of SeniorNet, an organization that supports seniors in learning about technology. By focusing on seniors as a group, we conform to the discourse of the digital divide. At the same time, we want to open up this discourse, to move outside of its conventional story lines and categories.

Using two composite indicators, they focus on cross-country differences and similarities in ICT usage across gender, age, education, and income levels. The authors' analysis indicates that the single most important factor limiting the digitalization of low-income people in all three countries was lack of education. The impact of income itself was low although positive. Their findings also suggest that comprehensive measures that mix standard ICTs with very advanced ones can be misleading.		Luis H.

The empirical research focuses on Web sites with performance results of schools and hospitals. These results are published on the Internet by dthird partiesT (government organizations, associations of public service organizations, and newspapers). Publications of performance results stimulate schools and hospitals to score better on performance indicators because they feel the dpublic eyesT on them. However, the risk of a dperformance paradoxT and adverse effects is great since strategic behavior may lead to higher scores but not improve the effectiveness of these organizations. The research provides moderate support for negative effects on the legitimacy of schools and hospitals which may be attributed to the sole use of the Internet as a medium for access to information and negligence of its communicative potential.

ACA mandated US residents to obtain health insurance. However, having insurance does not necessarily provide access to healthcare. These legislation changes made it imperative for researchers to explore into more detail the problem of healthcare accessibility. Recent advances in measuring healthcare accessibility have been fueled by a rapid improvement of the Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methodologies. This current study summarizes the abundance of existing knowledge on metrics of spatial accessibility and more specifically, the FCA family. Organization of previous studies in a more comprehensive manner can assist both researchers and practitioners who are struggling to identify which FCA methodology would best fit their needs. And finally, the study provides a step-by-step analysis methodology, which is beneficial for decision makers when considering solutions to the problem of physician shortage areas.	accessibility;algorithm;american cryptogram association;americas conference on information systems;curve fitting;formal concept analysis;imperative programming;rico;systematic review	Au Vo;Miloslava Plachkinova;Rahul Bhaskar	2015			engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management;data mining	HCI	-77.85003155842053	-13.20707867977297	195353

Despite Wikipedia’s successes with the open editing model, dissenting voices give rise to unreliable content due to conflicts amongst contributors. Frequently modified controversial articles by disagreeing editors leads to inconsistent information incorporated into knowledge bases. To address this well known issue, Wikipedia administrators are able to intervene and lock overheated controversial articles, however in doing so, they introduce their own biases. These actions in turn undermine both desirable neutrality and freedom policies of Wikipedia. In this paper we present an open Wiki model, called SmartWiki, which bridges readers closer to reliable information while also allowing all editors to freely contribute. From this perspective, the conflict issue results from presenting knowledge in an identical way to all readers, without regard for differences in their knowledge-seeking motivations and social context. This in turn negatively impacts the knowledge perception of readers. To address this, SmartWiki therefore considers two types of readers, “value adherents” who prefer simpler and more compatible viewpoints and “truth diggers” who crave deeper understanding of a topic, including both sides of controversies.

We describe how the communicative features of Twitter are used to enhance identities and produce status in these two different fields. While we find evidence that both groups perceive and enact affordances of status production, we identify important differences in how these affordances are enacted: (1) certain affordances of status production are enacted under one institutional logic, while they are not under another, (2) the same affordance is enacted under different institutional logics with different intensity, and (3) different features afford the same opportunities of status production to different users. We explain the differences through the influence of offline cultural capital on online status production.	converge;information systems research;information system;online and offline;swift (programming language);systems theory;technological singularity	Stefan Seidel;Nicholas Berente;Stefan Debortoli;Nikhil Srinivasan	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.236	media;concrete;social media;computer science;affordance;multimedia;world wide web;cultural diversity;information system;encoding	HCI	-81.96663792799738	-13.974849260712519	195506

Drawing on traditional content analysis and computer-assisted textual analysis, the study shows that privacy policies often omit essential information and fail to communicate data handling practices in a transparent manner. To reduce Internet users’ uncertainty about data handling practices and to help companies build stable relationships with users, privacy policies need to explain not only the data collection and sharing practices a company engages in but also those practices in which companies do not engage. Further, more exact lexical choice in privacy policies would increase the transparency of data handling practices and, therefore, user trust in World Wide Web (WWW) interactions. The results also call for less verbose texts and alternatives to the current narrative presentation format.	data mining;google sites;information retrieval;interaction;internet;mason;online shopping;privacy;user profile;www	Irene Pollach	2006	JOEUC	10.4018/joeuc.2006010102	privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;data collection	HCI	-83.21888530617399	-12.357589394429096	195873

We are able to communication with others at anytime and any-where and are free from the restrictions  of time and place. However, the degree of complexity of communication has increased so that we are not able to communicate  with others smoothly. As a result, knowledge creation is hampered because of the lack of communication. Therefore, we have  researched the information sharing system based on location information for understanding the situation of members. However,  using location information gives rise to two problems. One is the problem of privacy, and the other is the non-consecutive  location information problem.

One promising building block would be to revitalise special interest groups as loose knit Internet based communities. These would be what has been called """"networks of practice"""" or """"communities of interest"""". Although recognised phenomena, these terms are little more than labels, however. Far more has been written about the rich, close knit relations of communities of practice. This paper argues that as a model the community of practice concept is useful in defining dimensions by which such looser knit groups can be studied. To this end, community of practice theory is reviewed. The paper then presents a case study of an informal community among Web developers. It uses genre analysis to identify a dominant discourse which constitutes the list's local culture or repertoire. The genres in use are very efficient means of exchanging information, offering broad learning opportunities. They also construct a member identity. They exclude social and political issues, constructing """"the problem"""" of the Web as technical. The """"network"""" has a sense of community, yet it does not have the level of engagement of a community of practice because of the lack of task interdependence, the limits of the technology in use and the size of membership. This has some advantages such as giving it a longer life, requiring less commitment from members and coordinators and making it scale to numbers in a professional association. Professional associations could build up from such networks of practice, just as corporations have sought to cultivate spontaneous informal groups, to manage knowledge."""	interdependence;internet;loose coupling;spontaneous order;virtual community;web developer;world wide web	Andrew Cox;Anne Morris	2004	37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

This is particularly the case in environments which traditionally show much resistance to innovation. These are issues which can influence systems appreciation and evaluation of performance in an important way. The AREA project has been concerned with the design and testing of a multimedia distributed service able to provide remote access to expertise (experts systems or human experts), training facilities and distributed information in Mediterranean agricultural communities. To anticipate potential drawbacks, a combination of usability, usability-in-context, and scenario building has been used to ensure the compatibility of the system with social and cultural working practices and activities of an environment characteristic of rural agricultural regions of southern Europe. This paper demonstrates that such an approach can yield important benefits in design and development.	usability	R. Marom;M. Bolzoni;M. Goldberg;D.

Maintaining a reliable content stream is challenging for local communities with their bounded emphases and limited population of potential contributors. Some systems focus on specific information types (e.g. restaurant, events). Others allow many different information types. This paper reports our findings about the consequences of content diversity from a study of neighborhood-oriented Facebook groups. The findings raise questions about the viability of designs for local online communities that focus narrowly on single topics, goals, and audiences.	online community	Claudia A. López;Brian S.

Emphasis has been placed upon the use of these technologies to alleviate the massive twice-daily peak commuting loads imposed upon most major American cities. The primary means by which these technologies will be used is to allow """"information industry"""" workers to perform their jobs at work centers scattered throughout each city, close to their homes, rather than commuting long distances to work. A basic premise is made that this reorientation of urban work patterns will not occur unless the technological substitutes can be shown to be both economical and effective. The results of a study of a major insurance firm located in the Los Angeles central business district are presented. The study evaluated the present transportation patterns, population distribution, and business contact requirements of a major administrative division of this firm. These commuting and communicating patterns were then used as the basis for assessing the feasibility of the use of various levels of telecommunications and computer technology for allowing the substitution for commuting by """"telecommuting."""" Alternative telecommuting network designs were formulated and evaluated with respect to their ability to facilitate current work functions. Costs of network installation and operation were compared with the present costs of commuting. It is concluded that present communications and computer technology, in terms of """"off-the-shelf"""" hardware and services, can offer an economical substitute for commuting."""	computer;job stream;network congestion;requirement;telecommuting	Jack M.

Unfortunately, its use has become a battlefield for governments, corporations, and individuals to censor speech and access to information. In this paper, we present research into the use of social media for free speech in Turkey, Mongolia, and Zambia as a basis for discussing the limits of Internet freedoms. We discuss the actors, adversaries, social and technological limits, as well as limitations of existing tools for the free exchange of ideas on-line. We conclude with a discussion of how design and development choices for technology can affect marginalized communities, as well as the ethical and technical considerations for developing tools and applications that support Internet freedoms.	censoring (statistics);freedom of information laws by country;internet;knowledge acquisition;knowledge spillover;online and offline;social media	Michael Nekrasov;Lisa Parks;Elizabeth M.

The extent to which social media empower individuals represents a fruitful yet untapped area of communication research. This study explores the phenomenon whereby individuals exert their influence and seek change in a particular case of social media engagement-the Taksim Square protests in Turkey in 2013. Building from literatures in social media engagement and empowerment, and using Bandura's theory of self-efficacy, we content analyzed 770 Taksim-related messages on Twitter. Results suggest that efforts to seek change in social media are realized through information dissemination more than through calls to action and social organization. Namely, social media users seek influence through vicarious experience-representation of the experience of others-than direct personal experience. From these findings, we argue that social media is used to effect change from a distance, and that content ownership and online reputation are driving forces of online participation in an issue.	social media	Brian G.

The analysis is based on data from Finnish, British, and Greek sections of Eurobarometer collected in 2013 N = 3,009. Separate measures for class and status are applied in the analysis. The findings indicate that both access to and use of the Internet for cultural purposes are affected by a number of interdependent factors, whose effects and strengths vary significantly among the countries.

Her main premise is that communication technologies are instrumental in giving social movements a voice, and that beyond this, they are part of the impact of the social movements and they affect the way these movements operate. She calls the real life use of media in social movement activism “Emancipatory Communication Practices,” which she treats as a function of technological development that in return changes the political culture.	wiring	Murat Akser	2015	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444815579890a	resource mobilization;social science;socioeconomics;social change;sociology;communication;social psychology	HCI	-77.75884066744523	-12.826763518374628	199764

We argue that, as a particular type of discursive practice, memory work on the page bridged personal and collective action frames. This occurred in four overlapping ways. First, the page allowed for affective commemorative engagement that helped shape Brown's public image. Second, Brown's death was contextualized as part of systematic injustice against African Americans. Third, the past was used to legitimize present action, wherein the present was continually connected to the past and future. And fourth, particular discursive units became recognizable symbolic markers during the protests and for future recall. Based on this typology, we show that memory work, although multidirectional and in flux, is stabilized by the interactions between the page administrator, users, and Facebook's operational logic.
