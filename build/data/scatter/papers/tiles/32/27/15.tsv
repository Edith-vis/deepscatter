Three vector control tools are considered: insecticides (larvicide and adulticide) and mechanical control. The basic reproduction number associated to the model is presented. The problem is studied using an optimal control approach. The human data is based on the dengue outbreak that occurred in Cape Verde. Control measures are simulated in different scenarios and their consequences analyzed.	mutual exclusion;optimal control;visualizing energy resources dynamically on the earth	Helena Sofia Rodrigues;M.

00c204305183436e7bfacf6db0375c4f89da662d	study on growth regularity of bacillus cereus based on ftir		Combing the one-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technology with two order derivative spectrum technology, the growth change rule of bacillus cereus, the common food borne pathogenic bacteria, are analyzed without destruction, It is found that capsule, spore and other structures of bacillus cereus can be identified, based on the two order derivative spectra characteristic absorption peak. Observing shows the symmetric u0026 anti symmetric carboxyl group stretching vibration absorption peaks near 1604.48 cm−1 and 1396.21 cm−1 gradually weaken from lag phase to the stable phase. With protein amide absorption peak near 1654.63 cm−1 tending to be stable in the three stages, the structural changes of cell capsule can be acknowledged. The DPA absorption peak near 1617.98 cm−1, 1384.64 cm−1, and 1560.13 cm−1 indicates the presence of bacillus, changing in three stages from lag phase to stable phase. Experiments show that FTIR can distinguish cells’ material structure, which lays a theoretical foundation for the related devices of fast detection for bacillus cereus.

In most cases the complexity of this equation set prevents an analytical derivation of closed-form state solutions. Therefore the investigation of the nonlinear dynamics of memristors and circuits based upon them relies on software-based integration of the mathematical equations. In this paper, we highlight solution accuracy issues which may arise from an improper numerical integration of the equations, and then propose techniques addressing the problems properly. These guidelines represent a useful guide to engineers interested in the numerical analysis of memristor models.	algorithm;computer simulation;differential algebraic equation;electronic component;james strachan (programmer);linear algebra;matlab;memristor;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration	Alon Ascoli;Ronald Tetzlaff;Zdenek Biolek;Zdenek Kolka;Viera Biolková;Dalibor Biolek	2015	IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems	10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2426493	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science;numerical stability	EDA	82.00583704492189	-0.5066773265315656	184131

Based on a set of unorganized data points sampled with noise from a parameterized manifold, the local geometry of the manifold is learned by constructing an approximation for the tangent space at each data point, and those tangent spaces are then aligned to give the global coordinates of the data points with respect to the underlying manifold. We also present an error analysis of our algorithm showing that reconstruction errors can be quite small in some cases. We illustrate our algorithm using curves and surfaces both in two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) Euclidean spaces and in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. We also address several theoretical and algorithmic issues for further research and improvements.	algorithm;approximation;data point;error analysis (mathematics);nonlinear dimensionality reduction;nonlinear system;round-off error	Zhenyue Zhang;Hongyuan Zha	2004	SIAM J.

Unstable periodic solutions are often embedded in chaotic attractors and, following the seminal work of Ott et al. [1990], an interesting aspect of the research in nonlinear dynamical fields is the possibility of controlling the unstable orbits in a chaotic attractor, or, in other words, of using the chaotic attractor to stabilize the system for different periodic motions. In this way it is possible to control the system using small perturbations of the governing parameters, but the control can only drive the chaotic orbit towards one of the existing unstable orbits and it cannot drive the trajectory towards motions that are not present in the chaotic attractor. Usually, in the papers inspired by [Ott et al., 1990] the changes of the parameters to control the unstable orbits are discrete in time, since the control methods deal with the Poincaré map of the system. For that reason these methods are very sensitive to noise. An alternative approach, based on continuous time control, has been proposed by Pyragas and coworkers. In the present paper we aim to apply a version of the controlling algorithm developed for smooth systems in [Pyragas, 1992, 1995; Kittel et al., 1995] to the unstable periodic orbits of a stick-slip system. Therefore the present work is a contribution to the fast growing field of controlling chaos in nonsmooth systems [Chen, 2000; di Bernardo & Chen, 2000; Casas & Grebogi, 1997; Hu, 1997; Galvanetto, 2001].	algorithm;chaos theory;chen–ho encoding;control theory;dynamical system;embedded system;entity–relationship model;feedback;holographic principle;nonlinear system;over-the-top content;perturbation theory	Ugo Galvanetto	2002	I.

In particular, in this paper, we focus on a bifurcation phenomenon in PDW. Although the bifurcation of the walking period is one of the well-known features of PDW, it have not been studied sufficiently so far. Using techniques similar to our previous research, we derive an analytical Poincare map for 2-period walking and discuss the stability of PDW with this map. In addition, we point out that there is a similar interesting structure in this Poincare map.	approximation algorithm;bifurcation theory;dynamical system;robot;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yasuhiro Sugimoto;Koichi Osuka	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.20965/jrm.2008.p0559	control engineering;topology;control theory	Robotics	79.2300957856851	3.6124132714240313	186444

2fb6af8c1891aa6a74136acd623080307893ea52	open problems on information and feedback controlled systems	closed loop control;thermodynamics;information	Feedback or closed-loop control allows dynamical systems to increase their performance up to a limit imposed by the second law of thermodynamics. It is expected that within this limit, the system performance increases as the controller uses more information about the system. However, despite the relevant progresses made recently, a general and complete formal development to justify this statement using information theory is still lacking. We present here the state-of-the-art and the main open problems that include aspects of the redundancy of correlated operations of feedback control and the continuous operation of feedback control. Complete answers to these questions are required to firmly establish the thermodynamics of feedback controlled systems. Other relevant open questions concern the implications of the theoretical results for the limitations in the performance of feedback controlled flashing ratchets, and for the operation and performance of nanotechnology devices and biological systems.	bios;biological system;continuous operation;control theory;dynamical system;feedback;firmware;formal methods;information theory;kalman filter;landauer's principle;optimal control	Francisco J.

In this paper, a module that employs the structural effect for controlling behavior is constructed using coupled nonuniform van der Pol oscillators. We first examine the synchrony of two types of oscillators focusing on number; then, an oscillator module that changes its synchrony from structural disposition is constructed. Oscillators are mutually arranged on a ring-shaped network, and an additional connection is used for transformation. The stability of this system is also discussed, and finally, the procedure for designing this structure-sensitive module using more than three types of oscillators is described.	greater than;oscillator device component	Tetsuro Funato;Daisuke Kurabayashi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2008.918072	computer simulation;synchronization;the internet;stability;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;very-large-scale integration;coupling;robotics;oscillation;van der pol oscillator	Visualization	76.6672196719862	3.466154584879159	188563

The coupling constant K is assumed to be $>0$, independent of N. It is shown that when the system does not have equilibrium points, the global attractor of this system is a one-dimensional closed curve, so no matter what input frequencies $\omega_j$ are used, the existence, uniqueness, and global stability of a limit cycle of second kind are proved; therefore, any solution will be frequency locked in the long time limit. On the other hand, if there are equilibrium points in the system, any solution is bounded and converges to an equilibrium point.

8facefeb00cb9a8e46cb187e38184a167605f62d	periodicity and chaos amidst twisting and folding in two-dimensional maps		We study the dynamics of three planar, noninvertible maps which rotate and fold the plane. Two maps are inspired by real-world applications whereas the third map is constructed to serve as a toy model for the other two maps. The dynamics of the three maps are remarkably similar. A stable fixed point bifurcates through a Hopf–Neĭmark–Sacker which leads to a countably infinite set of resonance tongues in the parameter plane of the map. Within a resonance tongue a periodic point can bifurcate through a period-doubling cascade. At the end of the cascade we detect Henon-like attractors which are conjectured to be the closure of the unstable manifold of a saddle periodic point. These attractors have a folded structure which can be explained by means of the concept of critical lines. We also detect snap-back repellers which can either coexist with Henon-like attractors or which can be formed when the saddle-point of a Henon-like attractor becomes a source.	map;quasiperiodicity	Swier Garst;Alef E.

0b35992271dea147b2ba6d369b1099c20f686fe7	a simple approach to calculation and control of unstable periodic orbits in chaotic piecewise-linear systems		It is well known that some simple electric circuits behave chaotically, such as the Chua’s circuit [Madan, 1993] hysteresis circuits [Saito, 1990], the Colpitts oscillator [Kennedy, 1994] the buck converter [Yuan et al., 1998] and so on. In these systems, there exist some switching elements, so the overall system equation can be described by piecewise-linear functions. For piecewise-linear systems since exact solutions are obtained as piecewise functions, many analytic issues such as the stability of attractors, bifurcation and existence of chaos can be discussed in a rigorous way. For example, Andronov studied the stability of the limit cycle observed from the piecewise-linear model of a vacuum-tube oscillator. This work is introduced in [Pontryagin, 1962], where the differential equation includes a step-wise (binary level) function which is approximated by some continuous saturation characteristics. Since this model is a second-order autonomous system, the stability of its limit cycle can be studied analytically. However, this particular piecewise-linear system is probably one of the very few examples whose dynamical properties can be obtained in an analytical way. The key point in this analysis is that the switching time, at which the system equation changes nonsmoothly, can be exactly evaluated. Unfortunately, calculating a periodic orbit and analyzing its stability are very difficult because the conditions on the switching times cannot be explicitly derived, especially for higher-order systems [Madan, 1993]. Therefore, one has to resort to appropriate numerical methods, particularly for higher-order systems, for this kind of computation and analysis. And yet, even if an efficient method is available for calculating periodic orbits, a large number of UPOs embedded within a chaos attractor are not able to calculate in general. An attempt was made by Diakonos et al. [1998] to develop a systematic computational scheme for UPOs embedded within a chaotic attractor.

e0853444be6d8f4415783e4e6c6fe8bea07d9c1a	experimental definition of the basin of attraction for chua's circuit		Chaos is a dynamic phenomenon that can arise in physical nonlinear systems of very different natures, but nowhere else is it so ubiquitous and easily observed as in electronic circuits [Thompson & Chua, 1995]. We can identify two main reasons for this. First, the simplicity and inexpensive nature of the devices used, and second, the physics of electronic devices is well understood, so that the modeling equations of motion are the best expression of the particular physical phenomenon. These circuits could be integrated into LSI chips if massive practical applications should emerge. The earliest observations of chaos in electronic circuits were in forced nonlinear oscillators, like the sinusoidally excited neon bulb relaxation oscillator [van der Pol & van der Mark, 1927] and the forced negative resistance oscillator [Ueda & Akamatsu, 1980]. But among all electronic circuits, Chua’s circuit [Madan, 1993] deserves a special place, for its simplicity and universality. Simple because it consists of all linear elements but one, a nonlinear resistor (Chua’s diode) with a piecewise-linear v–i characteristic. Universal because all characteristic features of chaotic motion (like perioddoubling, intermittency, torus breakdown, etc.) have all been observed in this circuit [Madan, 1993]. The presence of noise and inherent experimental uncertainty in the definition of physical parameters make the task of an exact comparison between experimental and numerical results unfeasible. Although the overall scenario may be qualitatively comparable, particular thresholds, basin boundaries, bifurcations, may be quantitatively hard to locate. On the other hand, it is quite common for the behavior of a chaotic circuit to be affected by the perturbation introduced by the switching mechanism at instant t = 0, when a rough switch-on takes place. This peculiarity forbids the reproducibility of a particular experimental situation, especially when a specific initial condition is required to be set up. In this paper, we try to experimentally reproduce the basin boundaries for different multistable solutions of Chua’s circuit. Our task will be to set the initial voltages in the circuit as we like, with good precision. In order to carry out this investigation, the whole chaotic circuit has been redesigned, as we will explain later. A similar approach, although with different components have been carried out by [Heagy et al., 1994].	chaos theory;chua's circuit;diode;electronic circuit;experiment;image noise;initial condition;integrated circuit;linear programming relaxation;neon (light synthesizer);neon lamp;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;relaxation oscillator;universal turing machine;word lists by frequency	Guido Pegna;Rita Marrocu;Roberto Tonelli;Franco Meloni;Giovanni Santoboni	2000	I.

We can estimate initial conditions of periodic and chaotic systems and the required length of scalar signal is very small. We also find that the information flow from one variable to the other has logarithmic dependence on time. An important application of the method is in secure communications. The communication procedure has several advantages as compared to others using dynamical systems. A trajectory of a given dynamical system in its state space depends on the set of initial conditions with which it starts. In particular, the state of a chaotic system at a later time is exponentially sensitive to changes in its initial state [1]. This feature of a chaotic system leads to a complex behaviour in state space that appears random yet is deterministic, and the time evolution is uniquely fixed by the initial state of the system. Though there are several invariant measures of a chaotic system which are not sensitive to the initial conditions, the exact trajectory crucially depends on the initial state and hence is difficult to reproduce due to sensitivity to initial conditions. In light of these facts, it is interesting and important to ask whether the complete set of initial conditions of a given multivariable dynamical system can be estimated from a given scalar time series of a single state space variable. In this letter we present a novel and simple method to estimate the initial conditions from a given scalar time series. The method is based on a modified multidimen-sional Newton-Raphson method [1,2] that includes the time evolution of the system. The length of the time series required for estimating the initial conditions is very small. Also, the method works even when the conditional Lyapunov exponents are positive. An important application of our method is in the area of secure communications [3,4]. A nice feature of this application is that the signal that is transmitted is not the one modulated by the information signal, making it difficult to crack the method. Our method is also useful in the problem of synchronization of chaotic signals [5]. The knowledge of initial conditions means the response system can be be synchronized with the drive system almost instantaneously thereby removing the problem of transients. Also synchronization can be achieved in most of the cases …	chaos theory;dynamical system;initial condition;lyapunov fractal;modulation;newton's method;secure communication;state space;time series	Anil Maybhate;R.

Such networks can be used to model the behavior of populations of neurons in cortical tissue, referred to as neural mass models. A new approach is proposed to address conditions for local synchronization for this type of neural mass models. By analyzing the linearized model around a limit cycle, we study synchronization within a network with direct coupling. We use both analytical and numerical approaches to link the presence or absence of synchronized behavior to the location of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. For the analytical part, we apply two-time scale averaging and the Chetaev theorem,while, for the remaining part,weuse a recently proposednumerical approach. Sufficient conditions are established to highlight the effect of network topology on synchronous behavior when the interconnection is undirected. These conditions are utilized to address points that have been previously reported in the literature through simulations: synchronization might persist or vanish in the presence of perturbation in the interconnection gains. Simulation results confirm and illustrate our results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Robustness is an essential property of intracellular biochemical regulatory networks to attenuate the effects of internal fluctuation and external noise. In this study, several system control schemes are proposed for the robust circuit control design of stochastic linear and nonlinear biochemical regulatory networks. First, the robust stability of genetic and proteomic regulatory networks is discussed under internal fluctuations. Then, the filtering ability of external noises is analyzed for stochastic biochemical regulatory networks. For the case where a biochemical regulatory network is not sufficiently robust to tolerate internal fluctuation and does not have enough filtering ability to filter the external noise, how to improve the robustness and noise filtering ability of stochastic biochemical regulatory networks by engineered control mechanisms is also proposed via biochemical circuit design. The proposed robust gene circuit design principles have potential applications for robust biosynthetic network design. Finally, two design examples are given in-silico to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the performance of the proposed robust circuit design method.	anabolism;circuit design;control system;essence;network planning and design;nonlinear system;proteomics;quantum fluctuation;rna splicing;robustness (computer science);transcription, genetic	Bor-Sen Chen;P.-W.

59dbacda0621656f58a99d2997fa94b56d3d5683	formalization of lerch's theorem using hol light		The Laplace transform is an algebraic method that is widely used for analyzing physical systems by either solving the differential equations modeling their dynamics or by evaluating their transfer function. The dynamics of the given system are firstly modeled using differential equations and then Laplace transform is applied to convert these differential equations to their equivalent algebraic equations. These equations can further be simplified to either obtain the transfer function of the system or to find out the solution of the differential equations in frequency domain. Next, the uniqueness of the Laplace transform provides the solution of these differential equations in the time domain. The traditional Laplace transform based analysis techniques, i.e., paper-and-pencil proofs and computer simulation methods are error-prone due to their inherent limitations and thus are not suitable for the analysis of the systems. Higherorder-logic theorem proving can overcome these limitations of these techniques and can ascertain accurate analysis of the systems. In this paper, we extend our higher-order logic formalization of the Laplace transform, which includes the formal definition of the Laplace transform and verification of its various classical properties. One of the main contributions of the paper is the formalization of Lerch’s theorem, which describes the uniqueness of the Laplace transform and thus plays a vital role in solving linear differential equations in the frequency domain. For illustration, we present the formal analysis of a 4-π soft error crosstalk model, which is widely used in nanometer technologies, such as, Integrated Circuits (ICs).

We consider both compartmental ODE models, where each compartment represents a spatial domain of components interconnected through diffusion terms with like components in different compartments, and reaction-diffusion PDEs with Neumann boundary conditions. In both the discrete and continuous spatial domains, we assume the uncoupled dynamics are determined by a nonlinear system which admits an asymptotically stable limit cycle. The main contribution of the paper is a method to certify when the stable oscillatory trajectories of a diffusively coupled system are robust to diffusion, and to highlight cases where diffusion in fact leads to loss of spatial synchrony. We illustrate our results with a relaxation oscillator example.	agent-based model;limit cycle;linear programming relaxation;multi-agent system;multi-compartment model;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;rp (complexity);relaxation oscillator;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;time complexity	S.

By mapping a Boolean local Rule, or truth table, onto the point attractors of a specially tailored nonlinear dynamical system, we show how some of Wolfram’s empirical observations can be justified on firm ground. The advantage of this new approach for studying Cellular Automata phenomena is that it is based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics and attractors where many fuzzy concepts introduced by Wolfram via brute force observations can be defined and justified via mathematical analysis. The main result of Part I is the introduction of a fundamental concept called linear separability and a complexity index κ for each local Rule which characterizes the intrinsic geometrical structure of an induced “Boolean cube” in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, Wolfram’s seductive idea of a “threshold of complexity” is identified with the class of local Rules having a complexity index equal to 2.	a new kind of science;brute-force search;cellular automaton;complexity index;dynamical system;fuzzy concept;linear separability;nonlinear dynamics	Leon O.
