d4710ba19ed42a87479fbc472d2122644b1d75e6	peak effects in stable linear difference equations		We consider asymptotically stable scalar difference equations with unit-norm initial conditions. First, it is shown that the solution may happen to deviate far away from the equilibrium point at finite time instants prior to converging to zero. Second, for a number of root distributions and initial conditions, exact values of deviations or lower bounds are provided. Several specific difference equations known from the literature are also analyzed and estimates of deviations are proposed. Third, we consider difference equations with non-random noise (i.e., bounded-noise autoregression) and provide upper bounds on the solutions. Possible generalizations, e.g., to the vector case are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.	autoregressive model;best, worst and average case;coefficient;dynamical system;initial condition;markov chain;mathematical optimization;noise (electronics);point of view (computer hardware company);randomness;recurrence relation	Boris T.

4756397048ec0bd52e0c3be8b72b4a15a24be337	a class of pdes with nonlinear superposition principles		Through assuming that nonlinear superposition principles NLSPs are embedded in a Lie group, a class of 3rd-order PDEs is derived from a general determining equation that determine the invariant group. The corresponding NLSPs and transformation to linearize the nonlinear PDE are found, hence the governing PDE is proved C-integrable. In the end, some applications of the PDEs are explained, which shows that the result has very subtle relations with linearization of partial differential equation.

In particular, the inverse equation is redefined for a finite set of consecutive samples under the equivalent form of a discrete linear dynamic system whose input sequence is defined by the sequence of carrying capacity gains and the unforced dynamics is directly related to the intrinsic growth rate. For that purpose, the environment carrying capacity gains are allowed to be time-varying and designed for control purposes. The controllability property is also investigated on this dynamic extended system as well as the stability, equilibrium points and attractor oscillating trajectories. The properties of the dynamic system associated with the Beverton–Holt inverse equation allow extrapolate in a simple dual way the above properties to the standard Beverton–Holt equation. Some generalizations are given for the case when there are extra parameters in the equation or when the system is subject to the presence of additive disturbances. In all cases, a reference model being also of Beverton–Holt type is proposed to be followed by the control system. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The dynamics of the patient's evolution is analysed during a 500 day term, where the range of day-long transient response is clearly shown, and then the trend towards the asymptotic state is shown. This cell behavior is the patient's state before patient develops AIDS. Based on that information, an estimate of the exponential uniform bound for perturbation, as well as the phase-space attraction region are shown. This information will be helpful for the physician personal in order to obtain a benign transient concerning the viral load dynamics.

2726d327868ea1a0cef9fb6f16c4d3441f65d873	ℓ: the cases of infinite dimensional discrete autonomous systems and 2-d autonomous systems		In this paper, we analyze l2-stability of infinite dimensional discrete autonomous systems given in a state space formwith state transitionmatrix being a Laurent polynomial matrix A(σ , σ−1) in the shift operator σ . We give sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for l2-stability of such systems. We then use the theory of l2-stability, thus developed, to analyze l2-stability of discrete 2-D autonomous systems.We achieve this by showing how a discrete 2-D autonomous system can be converted to an equivalent infinite dimensional state space discrete autonomous system, where the state transition matrix turns out to be a Laurent polynomial matrix in the shift operator. Finally, we provide some easy-to-check numerical tests for l2-stability of the above-mentioned type of systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We have been able to develop analytic expressions for truncation approximants which can be generated by using finite left uppermost square blocks in the denumerable infinite number of PEA equations and their infinite limits. What we have revealed is the fact that the truncation approximants converge for initial value parameter, values residing at most in a disk centered at the expansion point and excluding the nearest zero(es). The numerical implementations validate this formation.	bidiagonal matrix;converge;evolution;initial condition;numerical analysis;padé approximant;truncation	Fatih Hunutlu;N. A.

I N T R O D U C T I O N A N D P R E L I M I N A R I E S Maximum principles for boundary value problems of ordinary differential equations without impulsive effects have been extensively studied in the literature. It is well known tha t maximum principles play an important role in the theory of differential equations. They often are employed to s tudy some qualitative aspects of differential equations. They are also essential for developing the monotone iterative method, a powerful theoretical method [1], which permits us to construct a sequence of approximate solutions converging to a solution of certain differential equations problems.

Indeed, differential equations with impulses are a basic tool for s tudying evolution processes tha t are subject to abrupt changes in their states (we refer to [2]). Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to develop a general theory for differential equations with impulses including some basic aspects of this theory (cf., [2]).

We model this type of network by piecewise linear differential equations formed by embedding a logical switching network in a differential equation. We generate continuous nonlinear equations by replacing the step function discontinuities in the piecewise linear equations by sigmoidal control functions. As the sigmoidal functions become steep, the continuous equations approach piecewise linear differential equations. We carry out numerical studies of the continuous and piecewise linear equations for a 4-dimensional example with particularly interesting and complex behavior, showing that the dynamics in the continuous equation approaches those in the piecewise linear equation as the sigmoids become steep.	piecewise linear continuation	Pabel Shahrear;Leon Glass;Roy Wilds;Roderick Edwards	2015	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2013.12.002	system of linear equations;independent equation;mathematical optimization;floquet theory;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;piecewise linear function;nonlinear system;mathematics;piecewise linear manifold;piecewise	ML	75.7549805142663	5.446207518124244	197430

Moreover, the nonlinear dynamics of the system restricted to this lowdimensional linear subspace are shown to accurately recover the spatio-temporal full PDE dynamics. A global set of modes, generated with sequential POD, are then used to produce time-periodic standing wave branches as a function of the period. This representation quantitatively reproduces the entire branch, including both large and small amplitude solutions, using only a few POD modes. This technique gives the potential for a new direction of exploration in this challenging problem, including an efficient way to characterize the bifurcation structure and stability of these solutions.	bifurcation theory;nonlinear system;principal component analysis	Matthew O.

The method used to prove Theorem A cannot be applied to the unbounded case. In this paper, we prove that if | f ( t , x , ? ) | ≤ µ e β | t | + M , then the perturbed nonlinear impulsive system has a unique solution.	nonlinear system	Xiaoqing Yuan;Yong-Hui Xia;Donal O'Regan	2014	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2014.07.100	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics	Logic	78.9882433603753	8.786163884080041	197907

Our method is based on the Lebeau--Robbiano strategy. The key is to establish a suitable observability estimate for some coupled fractional order backward stochastic parabolic systems with terminal states in finite dimensional spaces. Compared to deterministic coupled parabolic systems, the coupling appearing in diffusion terms in the stochastic case introduces quite interesting new phenomena. We present a somewhat surprising counterexample to show that the controllability of coupled stochastic parabolic systems is not robust with respect to the coupling coefficient in diffusion terms. This indicates that the usual Carleman-type estimate approach does not seem to work for our controllability problem. Moreover, our controllability results for parabolic systems with fractional order spatia...	parabolic antenna	Xu Liu	2014	SIAM J.

e1fe905fed3e74dc39f94be121d0d48c78b3e84e	nonlinear equations with gradient natural growth and distributional data, with applications to a schrödinger type equation		We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions with sharp constants on the distribution $sigma$ for the existence of a globally finite energy solution to the quasilinear equation with a gradient source term of natural growth of the form $-Delta_p u = |nabla u|^p + sigma$ in a bounded open set $Omegasubset mathbb{R}^n$. Here $Delta_p$, $pu003e1$, is the standard $p$-Laplacian operator defined by $Delta_p u={rm div}, (|nabla u|^{p-2}nabla u)$. The class of solutions that we are interested in consists of functions $uin W^{1,p}_0(Omega)$ such that $e^{{mu} u}in W^{1,p}_0(Omega)$ for some ${mu}u003e0$ and the inequality begin{equation*} int_{Omega} |varphi|^p |nabla u|^p dx leq A int_Omega |nabla varphi|^p dx end{equation*} holds for all $varphiin C_c^infty(Omega)$ with some constant $Au003e0$. This is a natural class of solutions at least when the distribution $sigma$ is nonnegative. The study of $-Delta_p u = |nabla u|^p + sigma$ is applied to show the existence of globally finite energy solutions to the quasilinear equation of Schrodinger type $-Delta_p v = sigma, v^{p-1}$, $vgeq 0$ in $Omega$, and $v=1$ on $partialOmega$, via the exponential transformation $umapsto v=e^{frac{u}{p-1}}$.	gradient;schrödinger	Karthik Adimurthi;Nguyen Cong Phuc	2018	J.
