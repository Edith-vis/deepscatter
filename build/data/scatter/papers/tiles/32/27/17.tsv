They are indeed shown to be particular cases of more general polynomials, whose usefulness in purely mathematical and applied contexts is discussed. The concepts introduced in the paper are also exploited to develop an elementary point of view on the theory of Legendre and Laguerre-Bessel functions.	legendre polynomials;polynomial	Giuseppe Dattoli;Hari M.

This makes them attractive to use when moments or modified moments are cumbersome to evaluate. However, generalized averaged Gaussian quadrature formulas may have nodes outside the convex hull of the support of the measure defining the associated Gauss rules. It may therefore not be possible to use generalized averaged Gaussian quadrature formulas with integrands that only are defined on the convex hull of the support of the measure. Generalized averaged Gaussian quadrature formulas are determined by symmetric tridiagonal matrices. This paper investigates whether removing some of the last rows and columns of these matrices gives quadrature rules whose nodes live in the convex hull of the support of the measure.	column (database);convex hull;gaussian quadrature;newton–cotes formulas;numerical integration;truncation	Dusan Lj.

We present a new method for deriving asymptotic expansions of ∫∞ 0 f(t)h(xt)dt for small x. We only require that f(t) and h(t) have asymptotic expansions at t = ∞ and t = 0, respectively. Remarkably, it is a very general technique that unifies a certain set of asymptotic methods. Watson’s lemma and other classical methods, Mellin transform techniques, McClure and Wong’s distributional approach, and the method of analytic continuation turn out to be simple corollaries of this method. In addition, the most amazing thing about it is that its mathematics are absolutely elemental and do not involve complicated analytical tools as the aforementioned methods do: it consists of simple “sums and subtractions.” Many known and new asymptotic expansions of important integral transforms are trivially derived from the approach presented here.	continuation;convolution;elemental	José L.

Such spaces are not Extended Chebyshev spaces but Quasi Extended Chebyshev spaces. They were recently introduced in CAGD for shape preservation purposes (Costantini in Math Comp 46:203–214; 1986, Costantini in Advanced Course on FAIRSHAPE, pp. 87–114 in 1996; Costantini in Curves and Surfaces with Applications in CAGD, pp. 85–94, 1997). Our results give a new insight into the special case p = q for which dimension elevation had already been considered, first when p = q was supposed to be an integer (Goodman and Mazure in J Approx Theory 109:48–81, 2001), then without the latter requirement (Costantini et al. in Numer Math 101:333–354, 2005). The question of dimension elevation in more general Quasi Extended Chebyshev spaces is also addressed.

Therefore in several papers further order conditions are derived to reduce this effect. In [13] the example of Prothero and Robinson is analysed to find further order conditions. In this paper we consider traditional ROW methods like ROS3P [7], ROS3PL [6], and RODASP [18] and modify these methods such that these further order conditions are satisfied. Numerical examples show the advantages of the new methods.	differential algebraic equation;numerical method;runge–kutta methods	Joachim Rang	2015	J.

0d0c84eaa47bc221549620ab5daf888f00347c6c	linearization of the products of the carlitz-srivastava polynomials of the first and second kinds via their integral representations	integral representations;linearization relations;gamma function;lauricella polynomials fd r;eulerian beta integral;appell polynomials f1;hypergeometric polynomials in two and more variables;carlitz srivastava polynomials of the first and second kinds	In this paper, the authors investigate two families of generalized Lauricella polynomials which are known as the Carlitz–Srivastava polynomials of the first and second kinds. By means of their multiple integral representations, it is shown how one can linearize the product of two different members of each of these two families of the Carlitz–Srivastava polynomials. Upon suitable specialization of the main results presented in this paper, the corresponding integral representations are deduced for such familiar classes of multivariable hypergeometric polynomials as (for example) the Lauricella polynomials F D in r variables and the Appell polynomials F1 in two variables. Each of these integral representations, which are derived as special cases of the main results in this paper, may also be viewed as a linearization relationship for the product of two different members of the associated family of multivariable hypergeometric polynomials. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Such equations B(t)&(t) = A(t)z(t) + f(t) are intensively studied from a numerical point of view. Canonical forms have been proposed to find conditions under which the equation admits a solution, to find the set of consistent initial conditions and to determine conditions under which there is a unique solution. However, since the situation where the system admits infinitely many solutions for one initial value is not really tractable in a numerician framework, few algorithms may be found in this latter case. Among them, we find the method of P. Kunkel and V. Mehrmann who propose a new set of local characterizing quantities for the treatment of the system. This leads to a generalization of the global index. Nevertheless, these latter characterizing quantities impose too restrictive conditions on the input equations. We propose new definitions for them that lead to a new algorithm which puts the initial system into a reduced form without doing any assumption on it. This allows us to propose a new generalization of the global index and a definition for the singularities of the initial system. The questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions are solved in all interval which does not contain singularity. Finally, since from a practical point of view the general case of analytic functions is difficult to handle, we focus on the polynomial case. We propose an effective algorithm that has been implemented and report some experiments.	algebraic equation;algorithm;cobham's thesis;coefficient;existential quantification;experiment;initial condition;numerical analysis;polynomial;singularity project	M.

Later Apprato et al. (1979) and Gout (1979, 1985) studied the interpolatory and convergence properties of lower degree rational finite elements and their applications in solving second order boundary value problems. In the present paper we introduce higher degree Wachspress functions by an iterative technique and study their properties from the point of view of applications to surface fitting problems. It is indeed remarkable to note that these functions possess properties similar to tensor product Bernstein polynomials and hence could be effectively used to generate quadrilateral patches.

To accelerate the convergence of the basic method of the fourth order we applied Börsch–Supan’s correction. It is proved that the R-order of convergence of the improved Euler-like method is six. The convergence analysis is derived under computationally verifiable initial conditions. The proposed algorithm possesses great computational efficiency since the increase of the convergence rate from 4 to 6 is obtained with negligible number of additional calculations. In order to demonstrate convergence properties of the suggested method, two numerical examples are given. 2007 Elsevier Inc.
