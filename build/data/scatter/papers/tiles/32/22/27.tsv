2580d5d9a0818fcd13dd39d9caba9afff908b114	omnidirectional transmit beamforming for massive mimo with uniform rectangular array		In public channels, common signals are required to transmit omnidirectionally to ensure cell-wide coverage. In this paper, we focus on omnidirectional beamforming for common signal transmission in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system equipped with a uniform rectangular array (URA). We first model the omnidirectional transmission as a feasibility optimization problem in a matrix form. By counting the number of equality constraints and the degrees of freedom of the matrix variable, we conjecture that it takes at least three beamforming vectors to achieve constant-power signal transmission at any direction for a URA with more than two rows/columns. We then propose an efficient iterative rank-reduction algorithm, which can obtain three beamforming vectors that can generate a perfectly flat radiation beampattern, but cannot reduce further for a URA with more than two rows/columns. That is, the algorithm numerically verifies the conjecture. The numerical results validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over the existing alternatives.	algorithm;beamforming;coded aperture;column (database);iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance per watt;the matrix	Dongliang Su;Yi Jiang;Xin Wang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422138	real-time computing;mimo;transmission (telecommunications);beamforming;radiation;control theory;symmetric matrix;omnidirectional antenna;matrix (mathematics);computer science;communication channel	Robotics	40.55660841865677	87.21162935334524	145401

An analog MIMO equalizer, which equalizes the deterministic MIMO channel is involved. Instead of interference suppression, the analog MIMO equalizer aligns the phases of the received signals and enhances the desired signal while it suppresses the undesired ones simultaneously. Although the magnitudes of different signal components of the received signals are preferred to be unique, further studies are applied in our work to investigate the validation of our system design with non-unique magnitudes by using practical on-board antennas. It is shown that the proposed system works well with non-unique magnitudes where undesired remaining interference occurs with limited power in comparison with the desired ones. Furthermore, the proposed design shows a great potential for putting a 1 Tbps wireless data bus into practical systems with moderate transmit power and fairly simple modulation schemes which provide high energy efficiency.	amplifier;analog-to-digital converter;bus (computing);computer architecture;data rate units;electrical connection;equalization (communications);interference (communication);lossy compression;mimo;modulation;numerical analysis;on-board data handling;soft-in soft-out decoder;spatial multiplexing;systems design;zero suppression	Xiaohang Song;Lukas Landau;Johannes Israel;Gerhard P.

55e81940a9206802bf6274cc331c89fcb973c5b6	full-duplex bi-directional mimo under imperfect csi and hardware impairments		In this paper, we consider a bi-directional in-band Full-Duplex (IBFD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where reduced hardware (HW) complexity analog self-interference cancellation (SIC) units are deployed at both IBFD MIMO nodes. The system is assumed to operate with imperfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge, and both transmitter (TX)s possess non-ideal radio frequency (RF) chains. Focusing on the TX power minimization problem with per node signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, we design a low-complexity iterative algorithm for the TX and receiver (RX) beamformers. According to the proposed algorithm, TX power is adjusted via the classical Perron-Frobenius (PF) theorem, whereas TX and RX beamforming (BF) vectors are designed in order to minimize the interference-distortion plus noise (IDN) components at RX, while maximizing the intended signal power. Our representative simulation results with realistic parameters for the analog canceller HW demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the relevant State-of-the-Art (SotA) designs in terms of outage probability of the provided available TX power.

Sophisticated multiantenna techniques can be employed to meet these objectives; in particular, multi-antenna precoding (or beamforming) methods are promising solutions. However, due to the strict power regulations placed on UWB transmissions, conventional precoding techniques are not always suitable for use in UWB networks. In this article we present new theoretical results and practical approaches to performing precoding in OFDM-based multi-antenna UWB systems.	beamforming;data rate units;gigabit;ultra-wideband	Cheran M.

Our previous work showed that NOMA can improve system performance compared with OMA even when combined with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). However, for NOMA with MIMO, the inter-user interference becomes a dominant part of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). Thus, the conventional channel information feedback scheme, which is based on channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback for OMA, is insufficient for base station (BS) to perform accurate modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection for NOMA users. In this paper, we propose two enhanced channel feedback schemes to improve performance of channel feedback for NOMA systems. One is based on outer loop link adaptation (OLLA), which controls the feedback update by a predefined time window to improve the accuracy. No extra feedback signaling is needed in the scheme. The other one improves the original channel feedback by an extra quantized increment feedback from user equipment (UE) to BS, which benefits BS with more information for MCS selection. The performance improvements of NOMA with closed-loop (CL) single-user (SU) MIMO are investigated by system-level simulations with practical assumptions. Simulation results show that the performance gains of NOMA for both cell average and cell-edge user throughputs improve with the proposed channel feedback schemes.	feedback;interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multi-user;oma;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Yang Lan;Anass Benjebbour;Xiaohang Chen;Anxin Li;Huiling Jiang	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504236	throughput;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.72434990942775	84.90486085821065	146426
8dd1509a073e0561d8054580b410c38854518715	nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation with reduced complexity for full duplex systems		Full duplex transmission is currently viewed as an important technology component for the future 5G and beyond mobile broadband technology. In order to realize its promised theoretical gain, sufficient cancellation of the self-interference must be achieved. The focus throughout this work will be on the digital cancellation, which main target is to cancel the residual self-interference resulting from the insufficient analog cancellation due to hardware imperfections, along with non-linearities existing in the transmitter chain. A novel pre-transmission transformation based on the Cholesky decomposition is presented, that aims at enhancing the digital cancellation performance. A digital cancellation based on the transversal recursive least squares with the exploitation of the dichotomous coordinate descent algorithm to lower the computational complexity is presented. The analysis was extended to include the existence of a received signal of interest, while simultaneously canceling the self-interference signal. By means of numerical simulations, a performance evaluation was carried out and results showed that the level of residual interference after the digital canceler reaches the simulated noise floor power level.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication)	Mustafa Emara;Kilian Roth;Leonardo Gomes Baltar;Michael Faerber;Josef A.

8e055824195ccb62dcd85696e6194dc56df8c29c	hybrid beamforming for downlink massive mimo systems with multiantenna user equipment		In this paper, a novel hybrid precoding algorithm is proposed for the downlink of a multiantenna multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Firstly, a modified block diagonalization precoding technique is presented. Then, it is shown that combining the modified block diagonalization with hybrid beamforming can achieve a similar sum-rate as block diagonalization with digital beamforming can. Moreover, the performance of the presented algorithm is comparable to the achievable rate in the single-user scenario where there is a full collaboration among the receivers. In a sparse scattering channel, the proposed technique has significantly higher sum-rate compared to a zero- forcing based hybrid beamformer. When digital phase shifters with 3-bits of resolution are used at the RF beamformer, the proposed algorithm achieves the performance of a hybrid beamforming algorithm with analog phase shifting.	algorithm;beamforming;mimo;multi-user;radio frequency;scenario (computing);singular value decomposition;sparse matrix;telecommunications link;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Sohail Payami;Mir Ghoraishi;Mehrdad Dianati	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288022	user equipment;mimo;electronic engineering;scattering channel;telecommunications link;computer science;radio frequency;precoding;beamforming;base station	Mobile	42.997062890914414	86.46857681244173	147151

When multiple URLLC connections are only intermittently active, dedicating many diversity resources to a single connection leads to inefficient operation. We address this problem through shared diversity resources and compare it to per-link dedicated diversity. Two receiver types are considered, minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and MMSE successive interference cancelation. Outage probability is evaluated by assuming channel estimation errors. The results show that it is possible to remain close to the reliability of reference system with a relatively low amount of pre-allocated resources.	channel state information;downtime;interference (communication);mean squared error;requirement;simplified instructional computer;telecommunications link	Rados&#x0142;aw Kotaba;Carles Navarro Manch&#x00F3;n;Tommaso Balercia;Petar Popovski	2018	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2018.2799592	outage probability;resource management;real-time computing;computer network;telecommunications link;latency (engineering);mathematics;minimum mean square error;communication channel	Mobile	40.622618665958456	85.15018331849281	147193

The performance of three different transmission schemes are evaluated in terms of the energy-per-bit required by the transmit power amplifier to achieve a desired energy-per-bit at the receiver. A fixed-power variable-rate transmission scheme is shown to provide the largest savings in energy. Using this as the basis for selecting a multiple access system, a code division multiple access system is presented and its performance is analyzed.	audio power amplifier;bandwidth expansion;bit error rate;decibel;eb/n0;telecommunications link;transceiver	Kevin J.

Starting from the continuous-time dynamics of matrix exponential learning, we develop a distributed optimization algorithm driven by a damping term which ensures the method's stability under stochastic perturbations and asynchronicities of arbitrary magnitude. As opposed to traditional water-filling methods, the algorithm's convergence properties (speed and accuracy) can be controlled by tuning the users' learning rate and/or the damping parameter. Accordingly, the algorithm converges arbitrarily close to an optimum signal covariance profile within a few iterations, even for large numbers of users and/or antennas per user; furthermore, the quality of the solution obtained remains robust in the presence of imperfect (or delayed) measurements and asynchronous user updates.	algorithm;channel state information;iteration;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;time complexity	Pierre Coucheney;Bruno Gaujal;Panayotis Mertikopoulos	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875404	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Theory	39.37871641112841	87.84423202838317	148694

It is demonstrated to be inefficient when they are combined together due to the shortage of channelization code resources. To use Smart Antennas more efficiently in TD-SCDMA HSDPA, one SDMA algorithm with combination of generic schedule algorithms is proposed. With SDMA, the system can allocate same channelization codes to different users who are spatially separable well enough. To reduce the complexity, the algorithm is simplified based on some reasonable scenario. The performances of the simplified algorithm with 3 different common schedule algorithms are evaluated through a system simulator, and the parameters affecting the algorithm are studied. In the end, the simulation results show that the system throughputs can be increased with optimized parameters.	algorithm;channelization (telecommunications);code;performance;simulation;smart antenna;standard database management analysis	Liang Hong;Jie Cui;Bo Chen;Yongyu Chang;Shuhui Liu;Dacheng Yang	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.332	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;smart antenna;statistics;computer network	EDA	41.424069289399355	82.5589575920691	150990
f465bfdaf3a9c5b28eef2dfd89f0ae9d568310fb	poster: multi-antenna successive interference cancellation to improve reliability of v2v communication		V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication has attracted attention to realize cooperative automated vehicles. In IEEE 802.11p, which standardizes physical and MAC layer specifications of V2V communication, broadcast CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) is adopted as an access control scheme. CSMA/CA is a protocol that avoids collision in a distributed manner by carrier sensing and controlling the transmission timing of each node. However, when communication traffic increases, multiple signals from multiple vehicles collide and thus communication reliability decreases [1]. One of the solutions to this problem is simultaneous transmission and SIC (Successive Interference Cancellation), which is widely studied as a technique to enable receivers to demodulate multiple signals from a mixed signal [2]. However, SIC is not successful when the difference of the received power between signals in a mixed signal is small, e.g. when the hidden node problem occurs. On the other hand, diversity techniques such as multi-antenna system are widely used to mitigate collision caused by the hidden node problem and channel fluctuation caused by fading. Multi-antenna systems decrease PER (Packet Error Rate) by selecting and/or combining the multiple received signals.	access control;bit error rate;communication complexity;interference (communication);mimo;mixed-signal integrated circuit;quantum fluctuation;simplified instructional computer;vehicle-to-vehicle	Tatsuya Ute;Yuta Watanabe;Koya Sato;Takeo Fujii;Takayuki Shimizu;Onur Altintas	2017	2017 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2017.8275643	carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;hidden node problem;computer network;single antenna interference cancellation;bit error rate;computer science;fading;broadcasting;demodulation;communication channel	Mobile	45.71563749908366	84.18688691287754	153008

The scheme enables transmission of control bits between cognitive users (also referred to as the secondary users (SUs)), without introducing interference to the primary users (PUs). First, a hybrid waveform with low power spectrum density is utilized to establish a lower level control channel (LLCC) for all SUs. Limited by the channel capacity, SUs can only shake hands and exchange low rate control bits with each other via the LLCC. Once any two SUs find enough common frequency band in their spectrum-hole lists, the waveform can be reconfigured to setup a higher level control channel (HLCC) with higher bit-rate between them. Thus, spectrum information can be synchronized in CRN via opportunistic control channels, and the coexistence between PUs and SUs is guaranteed. We also present a cascaded space-time interference suppression algorithm for LLCC receiver, which can keep SU from narrow band interference transmitted by PU. The numerical results obtained from MATLAB simulations demonstrate that the inter-ference from PUs located at various directions can be suppressed well within a wide range of signal-to-interference ratios.	algorithm;channel capacity;coexist (image);cognitive radio;frequency band;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);matlab;numerical analysis;simulation;spectral density;waveform;zero suppression	Fang-Jian Han;Li Yu;Fangjing Han	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092982	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	46.000402477964826	84.11804874007954	154884

This paper describes the performance analysis of a direct-sequence (DS) CDMA personal communication system sharing a common spectrum with narrowband microwave radio links in the 1.85 to 1.99 GHz band. The coexistence of these two systems within the same frequency band will improve the overall spectrum efficiency, but will also cause interference to both systems. In this paper it is shown that joint spatial and temporal optimum combining provides an efficient means of improving the performance of the DS-CDMA system through cancellation of the narrowband signal and the co-channel interferences. The proposed space-time architecture provides degrees of freedom for both diversity and interference cancellation. It is shown that the joint space-time receiver is robust with respect to the narrowband interference signal bandwidth and its carrier frequency offset from the DS-CDMA carrier frequency.

2bac7bc33f70e93844ef9a67dcc901170b89ce5b	dual phy layer for non-orthogonal multiple access transceiver in 5g networks		Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique, proposed in literature for the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks. The NOMA system model consists of the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as a pulse shaping technique in conjunction with a variable power domain for various users, allocated in proportion to each user’s channel gain. OFDM technique based on wavelet filter banks, namely wavelet OFDM (WOFDM) has been utilized in digital communication to improve the system robustness to noise and adjacent channel interference, and is therefore anticipated to be adopted for the NOMA technique. WOFDM in NOMA (WNOMA) outperforms OFDM-based conventional NOMA (CNOMA) with reference to interference mitigation, bandwidth efficiency, spectral confinement, and multi-user capacity. Most of the fourth generation (4G) networks are based on OFDM and its variants. Therefore, in this paper, keeping in view the interoperability with the 4G networks and the latency requirements in 5G, a dual physical layer based on conventional OFDM and WOFDM as pulse shaping methods, is proposed for the NOMA transceiver. Performance of WNOMA and CNOMA is analyzed for bit error rate in the presence of channel impairments including additive noise and IQ imbalance and multiuser capacity is also computed. Comparison of various parameters indicates the advantage of adopting WNOMA over its conventional counterpart for relatively poor channel conditions.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;fifth generation computer;filter bank;frequency divider;interference (communication);interoperability;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;multiplexing;noise shaping;phy (chip);power domains;pulse shaping;requirement;spectral efficiency;transceiver;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet	Sobia Baig;Muneeb Ahmad;Hafiz Muhammad Asif;Muhammad Naeem Shehzad;Mujtaba Hussain Jaffery	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2787200	adjacent-channel interference;latency (engineering);computer network;bit error rate;pulse shaping;computer science;system model;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;spectral efficiency;communication channel	Mobile	44.981398566679815	82.0265527514489	155255

In this paper, we demonstrate that an optimal amount of EVM exists for minimizing the transmitter power consumption while maintaining a constant bit error rate (BER) at the receiver. Alternatively, the EVM value may be chosen to maximize the channel capacity while maintaining a constant power consumption at the transmitter.

Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) contribute significantly to the implementation cost and power consumption of wireless receivers. The use of large antenna arrays in mmWave communications causes these costs to rise even further. Using low precision quantizers in ADCs can reduce these costs significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel receiver design using low precision quantizers drawing ideas from the parallel ADC design literature. Utilizing structural similarities between multi-antenna receivers and parallel ADCs, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio and achievable rate, respectively, scale linearly and logarithmically with the number of antennas. We also extend the idea to the scenario where multiple streams can be transmitted simultaneously. Our simulations of the receiver show promising bit error rate performance under different scenarios and also show how error control coding can be incorporated to improve performance. All our designs depend only on symbol rate sampling, which eliminates costly oversampling of high bandwidth signals.		Deepan Palguna;David James Love;Timothy A. Thomas;Amitava Ghosh	2016	IEEE Trans.

For the most part, the works appearing in the literature make idealized and simplifying assumptions about the underlying physical layer and some aspects of the link adaptation protocol. The result is that the performance predicted by such works may not necessarily be a good predictor of the actual performance in a fully deployed system. In this paper, we look to introduce elements into the SDMA-MAC concept that would allow us to better predict their performance under realistic operating conditions. Using a generic SDMA MAC, we look at how the network sum throughput changes with the introduction of the following: (1) use of the more practical MMSE algorithm, instead of the zero-forcing or singular-value-decomposition-based nulling algorithms used for receive beamnulling; (2) impact of channel estimation errors; (3) introduction of link adaptation mechanism specifically designed for concurrent SDMA MACs; and (4) incorporation of TX beamforming along with RX beamnulling. Following on the transmission window during which concurrent transmissions are allowed by the MAC, we qualify the impact of each of these four elements in isolation. At the conclusion, the performance of a system that incorporates elements 1-4 is presented and compared against the baseline system, showing an improvement of up to five times in the overall network sum throughput.	access control;algorithm;baseline (configuration management);beamforming;channel state information;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);kerrison predictor;mimo;phy (chip);singular value decomposition;standard database management analysis;throughput	Pengkai Zhao;Babak Daneshrad;Ajit Warrier;Weijun Zhu;Oscar Y.

At the transmitter either Transmit Antenna Selection (TAS) or Orthogonal Space Time Block Coding (OSTBC) is performed. In addition, Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) is performed at each receiver side. A Weighted Proportional Fair Scheduling (WPFS) approach is applied using the different user priorities and the instantaneous Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) of the corresponding equivalent Single Input Single Output (SISO) channels of the users as Channel Quality Information (CQI) to allocate the different subcarriers to the different users. These CQI values are assumed to be imperfect due to time delays and estimation errors. The joint impact of imperfect CQI and user priority on the system performance is analytically investigated for both transmission schemes. Numerical results show that serving users with different priorities comes at the expense of reduced system data rate and less robustness against imperfect CQI. Furthermore, it is beneficial to switch from TAS to OSTBC in scenarios for fast varying channels due to the additional exploitation of spatial diversity applying OSTBC.	broadcast delay;data rate units;modulation;multi-user;numerical analysis;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;soft-in soft-out decoder;subcarrier;telecommunications link;thermal-assisted switching;transmitter;uncompressed video;vii;x.690	Alexander Kühne;Anja Klein	2010	2010 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas (WSA)	10.1109/WSA.2010.5456442	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	39.365188292728845	84.391001070637	156916
f259afd9505d77db66459c1cc6984da0e9e4e87c	impacts of phase noise on digital self-interference cancellation in full-duplex communications		In full-duplex (FD) radios, phase noise leads to random phase mismatch between the self-interference (SI) and the reconstructed cancellation signal, resulting in possible performance degradation during SI cancellation. To explicitly analyze its impacts on the digital SI cancellation, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-modulated FD radio is considered with phase noises at both the transmitter and receiver. The closed-form expressions for both the digital cancellation capability and its limit for the large interference-to-noise ratio (INR) case are derived in terms of the power of the common phase error, INR, desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), channel estimation error and transmission delay. Based on the obtained digital cancellation capability, the achievable rate region of a two-way FD OFDM system with phase noise is characterized. Then, with a limited SI cancellation capability, the maximum outer bound of the rate region is proved to exist for sufficiently large transmission power. Furthermore, a minimum transmission power is obtained to achieve $\beta$ -portion of the cancellation capability limit and to ensure that the outer bound of the rate region is close to its maximum.	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;frequency divider;interference (communication);multiplexing;phase noise;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Xin Quan;Ying Liu;Shihai Shao;Chuan Huang;Youxi Tang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2017.2652384	telecommunications	Mobile	39.499842578854576	83.05476866554496	157488

The key ingredient of the proposed method is the custom designed beam pairs, from which there exists an invertible function of the AoD/AoA. A new multi-layer reference signal structure is developed for the proposed method to facilitate angle estimation for wideband channels with dual-polarized antenna elements. To reduce feedback in closed-loop frequency division duplexing systems, a novel differential feedback strategy is proposed to feedback the estimated angle pairs. Numerical results demonstrate that good azimuth/elevation AoD and AoA estimation performance can be achieved under different levels of signal-to-noise ratio, channel conditions, and antenna array configurations.	algorithm;angle of arrival;channel (communications);duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;glib;image resolution;layer (electronics);mimo;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);polarization (waves);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;super-resolution imaging;whole earth 'lectronic link	Dalin Zhu;Junil Choi;Robert W.

However, as signals from multiple transmitters may reach the UE at different times, CoMP networks might experience high time offsets, leading to significant performance loss in closed-loop transmission. In this paper we show that spacing between reference signals (RSs) imposes a phase offset on the transmit covariance matrix in presence of timing offset (TO), affecting the feedback generation. The promised advantages of closed-loop CoMP transmission vanish in presence of TO due to improper precoding matrix index (PMI) selection. Keeping the phase shift close to zero, reliable PMI selection can be guaranteed and as a result near optimum performance is achieved for closed-loop CoMP transmission in unsynchronized networks with TO present.	compaq lte;feedback;multipoint ground;timing closure;transmitter	Stanislaus Iwelski;Biljana Badic;Zijian Bai;RajaRajan Balraj;C.

While its advantages of increasing capacity and reducing output power are clear, understanding its SNR requirements in practical cases lacks sufficient theoretical support. This paper computes the relative power levels of the different signal, interference and noise terms in a Massive MIMO system using Maximum-Ratio Transmission (MRT). This brings light on the operational region of the system. The MRT operation is shown to support a maximum number of users, which is function of the selected modulation and coding scheme. The related expression also leads to a bound for other linear precoders. The impact of channel estimation is shown to be related to the number of orthogonal pilot sequences and users. When both are equal it leads to a 3 dB degradation. At system level, this model directly impacts output power requirements and hence system trade-offs when determining the number of antennas to use.	channel state information;decibel;elegant degradation;interference (communication);is functions;modulation;multi-user mimo;noise (electronics);requirement;signal-to-noise ratio	Claude Desset	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7527298	3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;statistics;mimo	Arch	43.12625147657685	82.27513283101489	160098

To reduce the burden of the downlink channel estimation and achieve partial spatial diversity from base station (BS) transmit antennas, we propose channel-independently precoded low-dimensional STBC. The precoding matrix and the signal constellation in the low-dimensional STBC are jointly designed to guarantee omnidirectional coverage at any instant time and sufficiently utilize the power amplifier capacities of BS transmit antennas, and at the same time, achieve the full diversity of the low-dimensional STBC. Under this framework, several designs are presented. To provide transmit diversity order of two, a precoded Alamouti code is proposed, which has a fast symbolwise maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. To provide transmit diversity order of four, a precoded quasi-orthogonal STBC is proposed, which has a pairwise ML decoding. Moreover, a precoded no-zero-entry Toeplitz code and a precoded no-zero-entry overlapped Alamouti code are also proposed. These two codes can achieve a higher diversity order with linear receivers.	audio power amplifier;channel state information;circular convolution;code;constant amplitude zero autocorrelation waveform;decoding methods;discrete cosine transform;emoticon;mimo;overhead (computing);spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;toeplitz hash algorithm	Xin Meng;Xiang-Gen Xia;Xiqi Gao	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2622259	telecommunications;computer science;mathematics	Mobile	43.18398126660775	84.5938173838629	161647

Regarding MIMO channel estimation, two pilot encoding algorithms known as Walsh–Hadamard encoding and Null Pilot encoding are possible in ATSC 3.0. The two MIMO pilot algorithms are standardized so as to have the same pilot positions and the same pilot boosting as single-input single-output, and the optimum pilot configuration has not been fully evaluated for MIMO. This paper focuses on the performance evaluation and optimization of the pilot boosting and the pilot patterns for two MIMO pilot encoding algorithms in ATSC 3.0 using physical layer simulations. This paper provides a great benefit to broadcasters to select the MIMO pilot configuration including pilot boosting, pilot pattern, and pilot encoding algorithm that better suits their service requirements.

Because of a low resolution precoder and the coarse knowledge of channel state information (CSI), interference among co-scheduled user equipments (UEs) is inescapable. In this paper, we propose an interference aware strategy to mitigate the interference. To achieve an intended result, we formulate functions corresponding to signal detection and gain insight into some interference cancelation schemes. The acknowledged optimal receiver applying Max-Log-Likelihood (ML) criterion is our original springboard. Considering that ML criterion is restricted by its unacceptable computational effort, we suggest to estimate the modulation type of interference before the detection. So a simplified method named table look-up scheme (TLS) is brought into. Then we discuss the necessity of TLS and provide relevant proofs to show its feasibility. Finally, simulation results show that our TLS assisted ML (TLS-ML) criterion outperforms those conventional ones.	channel state information;compaq lte;computation;computer data storage;detection theory;eisenstein's criterion;image resolution;interference (communication);internet relay chat;lookup table;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multi-user mimo;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transport layer security	Daixu Zheng;Yongyu Chang;Rongqian Qin;Hao Xu;Dacheng Yang	2014	2014 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2014.7063563	telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory	Mobile	40.73900222277246	86.75294851293725	162954

However, imperfect CSI, due to channel estimation error, imperfect CSI feedback and time selectivity of the channel, lead to a performance loss. In this paper, we propose a novel limited feedback algorithm for single-input single-output interference alignment in time-variant channels. The feedback algorithm encodes the channel evolution in a small number of subspace coefficients, which allow for reduced-rank channel prediction to compensate for the channel estimation error due to time selectivity of the fading process and feedback delay. An upper bound for the rate loss caused by feedback quantization and channel prediction is derived. Based on this bound, we develop a dimension switching algorithm for the reduced-rank predictor to find the best tradeoff between quantization and prediction error. Besides, we characterize the scaling of the required number of feedback bits in order to decouple the rate loss due to channel quantization from the transmit power. Simulation results show that a rate gain over the traditional nonpredictive feedback strategy can be secured and a  $60\%$ higher rate is achieved at 20-dB signal-to-noise ratio with moderatesxst mobility.	algorithm;binary logarithm;channel state information;coefficient;color depth;error detection and correction;feedback;image scaling;interference (communication);kerrison predictor;pre-shared key;quantization (signal processing);selectivity (electronic);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder	Zhinan Xu;Markus Hofer;Thomas Zemen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2647880	electronic engineering;channel state information;fading;selectivity;precoding;quantization (signal processing);small number;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science;control theory;communication channel	Mobile	41.77070220032333	85.21548638858208	163064

To separate spatially correlated and spatially uncorrelated parts of the channel, antennas are divided into a number of blocks according to their position in the array. Antennas in a block are spatially correlated and antennas across blocks tend to be spatially uncorrelated. A codebook design approach is proposed based on such antenna block division. After analyzing the correlation property, the codebook is proposed to be constructed from two component codebooks by Kronecker product. One component codebook is used to quantize spatially correlated part within a block, and the other codebook is designed to match channel across blocks which are spatially uncorrelated. The effectiveness of proposed codebook design approach is demonstrated by evaluation results.	codebook;mimo	Shaohui Sun;Qiubin Gao;Runhua Chen;Wenhong Chen;Hui Li;Rakesh Tamrakar	2015	2015 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China - Workshops (CIC/ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChinaW.2015.7961575	linde–buzo–gray algorithm;algorithm;mimo;kronecker product;planar array;real-time computing;computer science;codebook;theoretical computer science;antenna array;planar;communication channel	EDA	42.66705143607947	85.10300952962162	163202

The performance and utility of WBANs can be degraded due to interference. In this paper, our contribution for co-channel interference mitigation among coexisting WBANs is threefold. First, we propose a distributed orthogonal code allocation scheme, namely, OCAIM, where, each WBAN generates sensor interference lists (SILs), and then all sensors belonging to these lists are allocated orthogonal codes. Secondly, we propose a distributed time reference correlation scheme, namely, DTRC, that is used as a building block of OCAIM. DTRC enables each WBAN to generate a virtual time-based pattern to relate the different superframes. Accordingly, DTRC provides each WBAN with the knowledge about, 1) which superframes and, 2) which time-slots of those superframes interfere with the time-slots within its superframe. Thirdly, we further analyze the success and collision probabilities of frames transmissions when the number of coexisting WBANs grows. The simulation results demonstrate that OCAIM outperforms other competing schemes in terms of interference mitigation and power savings.	catastrophic interference;code;experiment;hadamard transform;interference (communication);jumbo frame;sensor;simulation;while	Mohamad Jaafar Ali;Hassine Moungla;Mohamed F.

The IQ imbalance parameters are recovered by a two-stage method. At the first stage, the base station (BS) antennas acquire phase-shifted versions of their imbalance parameters after receiving some predefined training sequence emitted by a specific transceiver that is near to the BS and shares flat-fading channels between itself and the BS. At the second stage, the phase shifts from the first stage are estimated by the specific transceiver through receiving a common sequence transmitted by the BS antennas alternatively. In order to jointly handle the IQ imbalance and nonlinear quantization loss, the IQ-imbalanced multiuser (MU)-MIMO with single-antenna users is first converted into an IQ-balanced MU-MIMO with dual-antenna users. Then, two kinds of channel estimator and multiuser detectors are constructed for the equivalent IQ-balanced system based on the spectral projected gradient method and vectorized message passing de-quantization algorithm. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the above baseband algorithms, and show that the proposed massive MIMO is more energy-efficient than the conventional one when the channel coherence time is long enough.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;baseband;gradient method;in-phase and quadrature components;message passing;multi-user mimo;multiuser dos;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;quantization (image processing);quantization (signal processing);sensor;signal processing;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;transceiver	Shengchu Wang;Lin Zhang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2613871	detector;message passing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;statistics;transceiver;mimo	Visualization	44.291133339967494	86.24856949926563	165126

In this paper, capitalizing on recent developments in adaptive combining, we propose two joint adaptive modulation and diversity combining (AMDC) schemes. With these schemes, the modulation mode and diversity combiner structure are adaptively determined based on the fading channel condition and error rate requirement. We accurately analyze these AMDC schemes in terms of processing power consumption, spectral efficiency and error rate performance. Selected numerical examples show that the proposed AMDC systems meet the target error rate requirement while achieving high spectral efficiency with low processing power consumption.	adaptive grammar;diplexer;modulation;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);spectral efficiency	Hong-Chuan Yang;Nesrine Belhaj;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2006	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1145/1143549.1143643	real-time computing;link adaptation;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;diversity combining;fading;statistics;spectral efficiency	Mobile	40.872665496372534	82.02787669113567	165395

To obtain this expression, we treat quantization noise as an additive quantization noise model. Considering the obtained expression, we show that low-resolution ADCs lead to a decrease in the achievable rate but the performance loss can be compensated by increasing the number of receiving antennas. In addition, we investigate the relation between the number of antennas and the ADC resolution, as well as the power-scaling law. These discussions support the feasibility of equipping highly economical ADCs with low resolution in practical massive MIMO systems.	approximation algorithm;image resolution;image scaling;ising model;mimo;maximal set;quantization (signal processing);telecommunications link;utility functions on indivisible goods	Li Fan;Shi Jin;Chao-Kai Wen;Haixia Zhang	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2494600	3g mimo;telecommunications link;telecommunications;noise measurement;antenna;control theory;mathematics;statistics;mimo	Metrics	42.119078305193746	85.6973500586733	165494

The cancellation precoding for the second release (bandwidth up to 212 MHz with much stronger FEXT) has not been standardized yet. Non-linear Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) is a promising candidate as it outperforms the linear precoding. Nevertheless, sequential processing of THP introduces unfavorable additional delay proportional to the number of lines. In this paper, we focus on non- linear precoding based on Lattice Reduction aided Zero-Forcing (ZF-LR) which can be implemented in parallel without any sequential processing delay. ZF-LR precoding has been proposed in wireless scenario using scalar scaling to adjust average transmit power. We modify this scheme to comply with per-line per-carrier power constraint and enable power control of each line individually (e.g., to adapt power for different line lengths). Optimized Power Allocation (OPA) for the modified scheme maximizing weighted sum-rate leads to the signomial optimization problem. Similarly to THP, ZF-LR precoding with OPA outperforms the linear precoding as well.	crosstalk;digital subscriber line;downstream (software development);glr parser;image scaling;lr parser;lattice reduction;mathematical optimization;next-generation network;opa;optimization problem;processing delay;signomial;weight function;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Miroslav Hekrdla;Andrea Matera;Umberto Spagnolini;Weiyang Wang	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842139	digital subscriber line;telecommunications;power control;computer science;lattice;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;precoding;wireless	EDA	40.23186442529408	83.11897382966974	165603

However, random delay results in limited performance gain from multipath diversity. In this paper, two promising delay optimization schemes are introduced for a multi cellular OFDM system with cooperative relaying with stationary multiple users and fixed relays. Both of the schemes basically aim to take the most advantages of the potential frequency selectivity by inserting pre-determined delays at the relays, in order to further improve the system performance (coverage and throughput). Evaluation results for different multipath fading environments show that the system performance with delay optimization increases tremendously compared with the case of random delay.	algorithm;feedback;interference (communication);linear approximation;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;multipath propagation;relay;scheduling (computing);selectivity (electronic);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stationary process;throughput	Slimane Ben Slimane;Xuesong Li;Bo Zhou;Nauroze Syed;Mohammad Abu Dheim	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.668	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;delay spread;computer performance;statistics	EDA	41.24495864580227	84.00048091379293	165862

The variable channel parameters such as delay spread, Doppler frequency spread, average signal to noise ratio and instantaneous channel gains influence the link adaptation parameters. Optimal adaptation of the link parameters based on the channel conditions would lead to highly complex systems with high overhead.

4d5460e2cf3a0c6b317566a8ad3682cc950eb592	increasing bandwidth efficiency in multibeam satellite systems under interference limited condition using overlay coding		We investigate the overlay coding scheme as the capacity achieving multi user detection (MUD) technique, i.e., transmitting over non-orthogonal channels, in forward link in multi-beam satellite systems with dense frequency reuse. The classic overlay coding scheme, uses the strongest co- channel interference (CCI) as extra source of information. The data intended for the target user is shared between the adjacent beams. The involved beams cooperate in jointly transmitting the data to the target user at the same time. Thus, the target user receives a signal containing the addition of the two data streams, i.e., as in a multiple access channel (MAC). Employing successive interference cancellation (SIC), both data could be recovered, resulting in higher throughput. However, in order to employ overlay coding in multibeam satellite systems, optimization strategies should be taken into consideration. Hence, we propose our advanced optimized overlay coding scheme, which considerably increases the spectral efficiency. We devise an information theoretic framework to compare different strategies by evaluating the aggregate data rate in the beam of interest.	aggregate data;bell laboratories layered space-time;data rate units;information source;information theory;interference (communication);mud;mathematical optimization;multi-user;simplified instructional computer;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Nazli Ahmad Khan Beigi;M.

However, due to the propagation characteristics of mmWave, beam alignment becomes a key challenge in mobile environments. In this paper, we develop a joint 3D recursive beam and channel tracking algorithm that can achieve low tracking error. We discuss the special challenges in optimazing the beamforming matrix of 3D tracking. A general asymptotically optimal beamforming matrix is given to obtain the minimum Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of beam and channel tracking. The beamforming matrix can be used in different channel environments when antenna number is large enough. In static scenarios, three theorems are developed to prove that the algorithm converges to the minimum CRLB. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms several existing algorithms.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;beamforming;phased array;recursion (computer science);simulation;software propagation	Yu Liu;Jiahui Li;Yin Sun;Shidong Zhou	2018	CoRR		asymptotically optimal algorithm;wireless;matrix (mathematics);algorithm;cramér–rao bound;tracking error;beamforming;computer science;upper and lower bounds;communication channel	Mobile	45.1644292708843	85.95156651327473	167846

When multimedia data specially an image is to be transferred through the wireless channel, image is highly degraded due to wireless channel errors such as fading, interference and bursty errors. Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) technique is considered as the most promising technique for efficient wireless data transmission. This paper presents the performance comparison of image transmission over MC-CDMA system with two interleaving techniques; Helical interleaving and chaotic interleaving. At the receiver, Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) equalization is employed. System performance is measured through Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Root Mean square Error (RMSE) values. From results, it has been evaluated that MC-CDMA system having chaotic interleaving and LMMSE performs better instead of having helical interleaving for image transmission over wireless channels.	forward error correction;interference (communication);mean squared error;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance evaluation	Shikha Jindal;Diwakar Agarwal	2014	2014 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968359	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	44.32466403342309	81.77680382599826	167951

Yet, it will not be effective for future requirements due to its synchronization and spectral efficiency related communication system drawbacks. To address these issues, universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC) technique has been proposed. Specifically, UFMC's less strict synchronization requirements and its increased spectral efficiency compared to the OFDM render it very desirable for 5G. In this study, UFMC is implemented by using software defined radios in real-time for the first time in the literature. With an effective synchronization solution, UFMC's design issues are tackled and a proper design model that is feasible for 5G requirements is demonstrated. Two methods are proposed for improvement of channel estimation and pilot usage for synchronization process. Moreover, as shown with real-time experiments, by carefully adjusting UFMC parameters, UFMC outperforms OFDM that is implemented in same configuration.	channel state information;etsi satellite digital radio;experiment;frequency divider;multiplexing;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;software deployment;spectral efficiency;testbed;waveform;x.690	Selahattin Gökceli;Buse Canli;Günes Karabulut-Kurt	2016	2016 IEEE 37th Sarnoff Symposium	10.1109/SARNOF.2016.7846772	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Embedded	44.45746406730087	82.83075094968522	168949

6452e719a5eb772054410d98e7e8ead8019bd49d	channel estimation and performance analysis of one-bit massive mimo systems		This paper considers channel estimation and system performance for the uplink of a single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output system. Each receiver antenna of the base station is assumed to be equipped with a pair of one-bit analog-to-digital converters to quantize the real and imaginary part of the received signal. We first propose an approach for channel estimation that is applicable for both flat and frequency-selective fading, based on the Bussgang decomposition that reformulates the nonlinear quantizer as a linear function with identical first- and second-order statistics. The resulting channel estimator outperforms previously proposed approaches across all SNRs. We then derive closed-form expressions for the achievable rate in flat fading channels assuming low SNR and a large number of users for the maximal ratio and zero forcing receivers that takes channel estimation error due to both noise and one-bit quantization into account. The closed-form expressions, in turn, allow us to obtain insight into important system design issues such as optimal resource allocation, maximal sum spectral efficiency, overall energy efficiency, and number of antennas. Numerical results are presented to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the benefit of optimizing system performance accordingly.	analog-to-digital converter;channel state information;imaginary time;linear function;mimo;maximal set;nonlinear system;profiling (computer programming);quantization (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;systems design;telecommunications link	Yongzhi Li;Cheng Tao;Gonzalo Seco-Granados;Amine Mezghani;A.

67c787da06321c20c636b8287821dd075be03373	spatial reuse for coexisting lte and wi-fi systems in unlicensed spectrum		In this paper, we leverage multi-antenna transmit beamforming techniques in order to enable spatial reuse for coexisting LTE and Wi-Fi systems in unlicensed spectrum. For the cellular small cell base stations equipped with multiple transmit antennas and operating in the unlicensed spectrum, some spatial degrees of freedom (DoF)s are dedicated to serving small cell user terminals (SUEs) and others are employed to mitigate interference to the co-existing co-channel Wi-Fi users by applying a linear multi-user precoding technique, such as zero-forcing transmit beamforming (ZFBF). Through careful allocation of spatial DoFs, enhanced spatial reuse of unlicensed spectrum resources can be achieved, thereby improving spectrum efficiency on unlicensed bands. However, due to inherent channel state information (CSI) estimation and feedback errors, ZFBF cannot completely alleviate detrimental co-channel interference effects. After analysing the so-called intra radio technology (intra-RAT) interference among SUEs, i.e., the residual interference caused by imperfect CSI used in ZFBF, and the inter-RAT interference experienced by the Wi-Fi users, we derive the throughput of the co-existing LTE and Wi-Fi systems, respectively. Based on the derived throughput, spatial DoF and power can be optimally allocated to balance the throughput between the small cell and Wi-Fi systems in different scenarios. Our theoretical analysis and proposed schemes are further confirmed with exhaustive numerical simulation results.	approximation;beamforming;channel state information;coexist (image);compaq lte;computer simulation;exptime;emoticon;frequency band;hotspot (wi-fi);interference (communication);kai's power tools;multi-user;numerical weather prediction;panorama tools;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;smart battery system;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;throughput	Rui Yin;Geoffrey Ye Li;Amine Maaref	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2017.2776932	computer network;spectrum management;channel state information;throughput;mathematics;beamforming;precoding;interference (wave propagation);spectral efficiency;base station	Mobile	40.553105862436404	85.69808129485588	170336

In this paper, a reduced-spaced channel quantization and feedback scheme which exploits slow variation of the angle-of-departure (AoD) distribution is proposed. By perceiving the instantaneous spatial channel to be a linear combination of slowly varying subset of matrices, it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme offers up to 62.5% dimensionality reduction with negligible throughput loss in 16-antenna FD-MIMO system. When used together with vector quantization, the proposed scheme offers substantial gain over that supported by 3GPP LTE.	beamforming;channel state information;compaq lte;dimensionality reduction;feedback;mimo;mimo-ofdm;overhead (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;vector quantization	Eko N.

We also introduce power scaling to enforce per-base station (BS) power constraints. We consider a massive MIMO system, where uncoordinated conventional beamforming is implemented in each cell. PCP acts as outer linear precoding prior to conventional beamforming through a cooperative transmission scheme with 3 base stations (BSs) involved. We partition each cell into 3 sectors and assign pilot sequences in a suitable way in order to perform PCP. In order to characterize performance and avoid time-consuming simulations, we employ large system analysis and random matrix theory. Numerical results show that the superiority of the clustered PCP is marginal for the moderate number of transmit antennas, but it becomes more significant in a massive MIMO mode.

To optimally exploit multi-user diversity and frequency selectivity, exhaustive channel information is needed for every user - an impracticality given limited feedback bandwidth. Simple and efficient feedback schemes therefore become a crucial task in designing a next generation standard. In this paper, two near-optimal feedback schemes are proposed that achieve most of the multi-user scheduling benefit with very few feedback bits. It is also shown that the feedback schemes are robust to long feedback intervals. As expected, at higher Doppler spread, the performance gap using the proposed schemes becomes larger but still provides satisfactory performance.	feedback;multi-user;scheduling (computing);selectivity (electronic);telecommunications link;velocity (software development)	Yakun Sun;Weimin Xiao;Robert Love;Kenneth Stewart;Amitava Ghosh;Rapeepat Ratasuk;Brian K.

a4ffdfe878dcef43f1fef847f7e89faff7def55c	flexible filter bank multi-carriers pon based on two-dimensional multiple probabilistic shaping distribution		We propose a filter bank multi-carriers (FBMC) passive optical network (PON) system based on 2-D multiple probabilistic shaping (MPS) distribution to achieve flexible and adjustable access bit-rates. The proposed PON can assign different probabilistic shaping schemes to different time-slots and subcarriers, thus improving the system flexibility and adjustability in both the time and frequency domains. Carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation are adopted to achieve the implementation of the intensity-modulation and direct-modulation applied in our proposed PON system. Moreover, for the first time, an experiment demonstrating MPS FBMC signal transmission over a 25-km standard single mode fiber in PON system is successfully carried out to verify the favorable performance. The bit error rate performance of different MPS time-slots at bit-rates of 23.665, 20.663, 17.666, and 15.481 Gbit/s are investigated. The received optical powers at the threshold for hard-decision forward error correction are −16.13, −16.94, −17.85, and −18.81 dBm, respectively. These experiment results indicate that our proposed MPS FBMC PON system can be flexible and adjustable in acquiring different and dynamic access bit-rates, which suggests a prospective solution for the next generation passive optical network.

Work on DSM has progressed considerably over the past decade. Most of this work, however, deals with the idealized situation of perfect synchronization amongst the multiple users. This work deals with a more realistic albeit more difficult situation, i.e we consider the DSM problem with asynchronous crosstalk. We propose a novel solution for this problem, one that is mainly based on the approximate summability of the crosstalk damage ratio (CDR). Performance of the algorithm is assessed through numerical experiments and is shown to be better than the performance of state-of-the-art methods.	approximation algorithm;crosstalk;digital subscriber line;experiment;interference (communication);multi-user;numerical analysis	Rodrigo B.

With the proposed allocation scheme, each mobile station can employ a decision-directed channel estimation method without demodulating data bursts destined for other stations. Three decision-directed channel estimation methods, each with different computational complexity, are suggested based on the proposed allocation method. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that one of the suggested decision-directed methods, the adaptive weighted-average estimation, outperforms the widely used two-dimensional interpolation method for all considered channel models, especially for high-speed reception in a large-delay-spread channel. Therefore, the proposed allocation method together with the adaptive weighted-average estimation can be used to increase the successful transmission probability for data bursts requiring low error rates, such as hybrid automatic repeat request bursts.	channel state information;computational complexity theory;hybrid automatic repeat request;interpolation;simulation;telecommunications link	Yu-Sun Liu;Shingchern D.

Since scheduling changes the spatial transmit signal processing with each time slot, information from neighboring base stations is required for data encoding. This can, in theory, be accomplished by a high-capacity backhaul network through which the base stations exchange channel state information (CSI) and other control signals. In reality, however, the temporal granularity of the scheduler does not allow for timely distribution of CSI among base stations. We propose a two-phase scheduler which optimizes the precoding in the first phase and allows the users to feed back their instantaneous interference power in the second phase. For the single-user case, we present a practical scheme that combines two-phase scheduling with precoders that maximize the signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. If the users feed back the interference power together with a supported rate, communication between base stations can be limited to integers. By comparing the performance to multi-user two-phase scheduling with dirty paper coding and to algorithms that share CSI among base stations we show that two-phase scheduling is a technically and practically feasible solution to deal with non-stationary intercell interference.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;catastrophic interference;channel state information;code;computer simulation;deferred procedure call;frequency band;interactive machine translation;interference (communication);multi-user;nonlinear system;requirement;scheduling (computing);signal processing;spectral efficiency;spectral leakage;stationary process;telecommunications link;two-phase commit protocol	Ralf Bendlin;Hans H.

First, we describe the system model of AF-FDR, where the relay transparently extends the range of the main access point (AP) to reach a station located outside the AP’s radio coverage. We highlight the SI (and its suppression) impact on FDR, due to simultaneous transmission/reception on the same frequency. We then present a novel Wi-Fi compliant estimation technique of the SI channel and its delay parameters, which are later used for AC, achieving SI suppression of up to an additional 35 dB. The proposed AF-FDR system is simulated in a fading channel environment with Doppler frequency of up to 10 Hz. Simulation results show cancellation gains within 1 dB of static channels with an SI training overhead of 1.5%.		Sergey Shaboyan;Alireza Shahan Behbahani;Ahmed M.

In this paper, we design algorithms for three new radio-frequency (RF) architectures that are based on different combinations of phase shifters and variable gain amplifiers. From a baseband point of view, each architecture poses a different beamforming design problem in which the transmit/receive beamformers are constrained to have constant-modulus complex, real, or nonnegative real weights, respectively. Assuming perfect channel knowledge, we consider the problem of designing these constrained RF beamformers under orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. For the general MIMO case, the resulting optimization problems are not convex and are, therefore, difficult to solve. However, the single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input-single-output cases either have a closed-form solution or can be reformulated as convex problems. Exploiting this fact, an alternating optimization procedure is used to find a suboptimal solution for the MIMO case. The performance of the different RF-MIMO architectures is compared by means of Monte Carlo simulations, which allows us to conclude that the architecture based solely on phase shifters (RF equal-gain beamforming) provides the best results.	algorithm;baseband;beamforming;convex optimization;digital subchannel;elegant degradation;frame grabber;linear programming relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;monte carlo method;multiplexing;phase-locked loop;point of view (computer hardware company);procedural reasoning system;rf modulator;radio frequency;simulation;subcarrier;system analysis;system time;telecommunications link;variable-gain amplifier	Fouad Gholam;Javier Vía;Ignacio Santamaría	2011	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2142205	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Metrics	42.72725073243336	87.62090449377835	174655

The impact of DMT subchannel bit loading on the TCP throughput performance is studied. The simulation results show that there is a threshold for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gap or bit error rate (BER) above which TCP throughput drops quickly. This threshold takes its value in a wide range depending on the TCP round-trip time as well as channel noises. This suggests that it would be insuf®cient to set a ®xed target BER at, e.g. 10, when calculating the number of bits to be loaded in each subchannels. Instead, the bit loading should take TCP performance into account. Finally a dynamic bit loading scheme is proposed, which jointly optimizes the channel bit rate and TCP throughput performance. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In a cluster of N+1 receive nodes, one node is designated as the final receiver, and the N other nodes act as amplify-and-forward relays, which adapt their phases such that the relayed signals add up constructively at the designated receiver. This yields received SNR scaling linearly with N, while avoiding the linear increase in overhead incurred by a direct approach in which received signals are separately quantized and transmitted for centralized processing. By transforming the task of long-distance distributed receive beamforming into one of local distributed transmit beamforming, we can leverage a scalable one-bit feedback algorithm for phase synchronization. We show that time division between the long-distance and local links eliminates the need for explicit frequency synchronization. We provide an analytical framework, whose results closely match Monte Carlo simulations, to evaluate the impact of phase noise due to relaying delay on the performance of the one-bit feedback algorithm. Experimental results from our prototype implementation on software-defined radios demonstrate the expected gains in received signal strength despite significant oscillator drift, and are consistent with results from our analytical framework.	algorithm;beamforming;centralized computing;crystal oscillator;image scaling;monte carlo method;overhead (computing);phase noise;prototype;relay;scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	François Quitin;Andrew T.

Meanwhile, the mm-Wave base station (BS) needs to employ a large number of antenna elements to increase the gain as well as serve a huge number of users. However, a vast number of antenna elements causes dimensionality problem in channel correlation matrix (rotation matrix). Therefore, we propose a novel codebook construction design based on CUR-decomposition technique to reduce the dimensionality problem. In this paper, the original correlation matrix is decomposed to the product of three low dimension matrices (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mathbf {C}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mathbf {U}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mathbf {R}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). The new rotated codebook is then constructed by the new rotation matrix. Moreover, we evaluate the new decomposition matrix with the original matrix in terms of compression ratio and mismatch error. We also provide the achievable sum rate capacities for singular value decomposition, zero forcing, and a matched filter techniques to compare with the proposed method. Furthermore, the system capacity enhancement related to the number of antenna elements and the required feedback bits are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves much better system performance since the dimensionality problem is solved. The proposed method can be applied in the fifth generation massive antenna multi-user system with over a hundred antenna elements."""	channel capacity;codebook;data rate units;dimensionality reduction;fifth generation computer;matched filter;multi-user;qr decomposition;simulation;singular value decomposition	Xiongwen Zhao;Adam Mohamed Ahmed Abdo;Chen Xu;Suiyan Geng;Jianhua Zhang;Imran Memon	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2786681	rotation matrix;distributed computing;codebook;covariance matrix;dimensionality reduction;computer science;topology;matrix decomposition;singular value decomposition;matched filter;matrix (mathematics)	Mobile	43.15937728653566	86.21677288375486	178132

The DSL binder's metallic sheath is used as a common reference to obtain reliable channels for the common-mode signals. The direct and crosstalk channels for the common-mode signal are obtained using multi-conductor transmission line theory, and the data-rate improvement by exploiting these extra dimensions is presented. The lines in the binder are coordinated to cancel differential-mode crosstalk and also to avoid interference caused by radiation from the common-mode within the binder. The high level of common-mode noise is countered by exploiting the correlation between the differential- and common-mode noises. Numerical results based on the derived models show data-rate improvements of up to 100% compared to using only differential-mode transmission.	aggregate data;bandwidth (signal processing);crosstalk;data rate units;digital monetary trust;digital subscriber line;downstream (software development);fiber to the x;file binder;high-level programming language;interference (communication);numerical method;transfer function;transmission line;uncompressed video;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Sumanth Jagannathan;Vahbod Pourahmad;Kibeom Seong;John M.

This is because it keeps most of the advantages of OFDMA in addition to low peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Designing diversity achieving schemes for SC-FDMA is a challenging task. The code should not affect the PAPR among other constraints. In this paper, we propose cooperative diversity schemes for SC-FDMA systems. Specifically, distributed space-time/frequency codes are proposed. The proposed distributed space-frequency code (DSFC) takes into account the low PAPR which is the feature of the system. Both decode-and-forward (DAF) and amplify-and-forward (AAF) protocols are considered. Erroneous decoding at the relay node is taken into account. Moreover, we propose a bandwidth efficient distributed space-time code (DSTC) for slow fading relay channels with DAF. Analytical and simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes achieve full diversity at the expense of small performance loss compared to the proposed codes in the literature.	telecommunications link	Azzam Y.

The requirements of the eV2X service are significantly higher than those of existing V2X, with the required data transmission rates ranging from tens of Mbps to up to 1000 Mbps. In addition, communication should be performed with an extremely low error probability within a time delay of several to several tens of ms. In this study, a low-density parity-check code and 256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which are new radio technologies, are applied to meet the low-latency, high-reliability, and high-data-rate requirements of eV2X. In addition, we propose a vehicle multiple-input multiple-output system.

This paper reports indoor experimental results obtained for a newly developed and implemented downlink (DL) MU-MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transceiver for gigabit wireless local area network systems in the microwave band. In the transceiver, the channel state information (CSI) is estimated at each user and fed back to an access point (AP) on a real-time basis. At the AP, the estimated CSI is used to calculate the transmit beamforming weight for DL MU-MIMO transmission. This paper also proposes a recursive inverse matrix computation scheme for computing the transmit weight in real time. Experiments with the developed transceiver demonstrate its feasibility in a number of indoor scenarios. The experimental results clarify that DL MU-MIMO-OFDM transmission can achieve a 972-Mbit/s transmission data rate with simple digital signal processing of single-antenna users in an indoor environment.	beamforming;channel state information;computation;data rate units;digital signal processing;frequency divider;gigabit;mimo-ofdm;microwave;multiplexing;numerical linear algebra;real-time clock;recursion;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transceiver;wireless access point	Koichi Ishihara;Yusuke Asai;Riichi Kudo;Takeo Ichikawa;Yasushi Takatori;Masato Mizoguchi	2013	EURASIP J.

bf325fac7480a98d7c2b2b9611b08029eab7e8c7	multiuser precoding and channel estimation for hybrid millimeter wave mimo systems		In this paper, we develop a low-complexity channel estimation for hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, where the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is much less than the number of antennas equipped at each transceiver. The proposed channel estimation algorithm aims to estimate the strongest angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) at both the base station (BS) and the users. Then all the users transmit orthogonal pilot symbols to the BS via these estimated strongest AoAs to facilitate the channel estimation. The algorithm does not require any explicit channel state information (CSI) feedback from the users and the associated signalling overhead of the algorithm is only proportional to the number of users, which is significantly less compared to various existing schemes. Besides, the proposed algorithm is applicable to both non-sparse and sparse mmWave channel environments. Based on the estimated CSI, zero-forcing (ZF) precoding is adopted for multiuser downlink transmission. In addition, we derive a tight achievable rate upper bound of the system. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme offer a considerable achievable rate gain compared to fully digital systems, where the number of RF chains equipped at each transceiver is equal to the number of antennas. Furthermore, the achievable rate performance gap between the considered hybrid mmWave systems and the fully digital system is characterized, which provides useful system design insights.	algorithm;binary logarithm;channel state information;convex function;digital electronics;european home systems protocol;mimo;multi-user;overhead (computing);radio frequency;rewrite (programming);simulation;social inequality;sparse matrix;systems design;telecommunications link;transceiver;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Lou Zhao;Derrick Wing Kwan Ng	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997048	mimo;real-time computing;channel state information;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;transceiver;telecommunications;systems design;precoding;computer science;communication channel;base station	Mobile	41.74009462629843	86.41226974827536	183278

A low-complexity hardware architecture is to use a number of AFE chains that is less than the number of the antennas. Beamforming for this low-complexity hardware architecture involves both digital and analog beamforming, which is termed hybrid analog/digital beamforming. This paper focuses on the optimization for hybrid analog/digital beamforming to minimize the transmit power subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints. Properties on the feasibility and optimum of the considered problem are derived. Numerical algorithm based on semi-definite positive (SDP) relaxation is proposed in an attempt to solve the optimization problem. Numerical simulations show that the performance of hybrid analog/digital beamforming is highly related to the correlation of the channel coefficients of different subcarriers.	algorithm;analog front-end;beamforming;coefficient;front and back ends;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;semiconductor industry;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier	Jian Geng;Zaixue Wei;Xianling Wang;Wei Xiang;Dacheng Yang	2013	2013 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824973	telecommunications;computer science;smart antenna;control theory;interference;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	41.63128151468098	88.17119247758711	183739

These proposed schemes are compared with cooperative relaying scheme with virtual OSTBC and 1/2 code rate. The considered schemes are used for creating virtual 4 × 1 multiple input–single output (MISO) channel, and include one base station with two antennas, two relay stations each with a single antenna and one mobile station with a single antenna. Obtained results show that in the case of the same bit rate the proposed schemes provide better bit error rate (BER) performances than virtual OSTBC with 1/2 code rate. On the other side, for the same symbol constellations the proposed schemes have almost identical BER performances as virtual OSTBC with 1/2 code rate, but with a benefit of 1.5 times increased code rate.	2.5d;code rate;multi-user mimo	Zoran Veljovic;Ugljesa Urosevic	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3838-z	real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	42.10286501058445	81.679131350885	184547

Considering the difficulty to acquire the channel state information (CSI) of the direct link at relay node, we first derive an iterative linear processing scheme for the relay node ignoring the direct link between two source nodes. Then the receive processing matrix combining the signal from direct link and relay link can be easily given according to MMSE orthogonality principle. Finally by comparing other schemes that can accomplish bidirectional data exchange, simulation results show that our proposed 3-phase cooperative scheme can achieve better tradeoff of link reliability and spectrum efficiency especially when the direct link is in medium quality.	channel state information;cooperative mimo;inline linking;iterative method;mean squared error;relay;simulation;spectral efficiency	Gen Li;Ying Wang;Ping Zhang	2012	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2012.2191812	data exchange;process design;spectrum;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;mean squared error;channel state information;relay channel;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.20615918519257	88.43253055278002	185078

Our primary motivation is construction of practical and portable multi-antenna configurations with a very small and a-priori fixed volume for placing antennas. Using spectral efficiency as a target metric for array optimization, we show that any array configuration, transmit or receive, can be characterized via a parameter that we interpret as ldquoeffective degrees of freedom.rdquo For any array configuration, effective degrees of freedom describes an equivalent uncorrelated array, which results in the same low-power behavior of spectral efficiency. Joint optimization of transmit and receive antenna configurations decouples into maximizing effective degrees of freedom for transmitter and receiver separately. To achieve this goal, we introduce and study a theoretical benchmark of ldquolimiting degrees of freedom, rdquo which is the least upper bound on effective degrees of freedom, evaluated over all configurations with finite number of antennas. Limiting degrees of freedom therefore describes the best possible performance for any transceiver array which confines its elements inside a given space. We compute a closed-form expression for limiting degrees of freedom of a circular geometry. Finally, we present numerical procedure and examples for designing linear and square arrays with nonuniform spacing, which typically exhibit significant spectral efficiency gains over uniform arrays.	benchmark (computing);ibm power systems;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;set packing;spectral efficiency;transceiver;transmitter	Tarik Muharemovic;Ashutosh Sabharwal;Behnaam Aazhang	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.911175	computer simulation;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;degrees of freedom;statistics;transceiver	Robotics	42.687919022167094	87.80103752574723	187560

To improve the interference problem in channel estimation for coherent SSS detection in the conventional neighbor cell search approaches, we propose a non-coherent scheme that takes advantage of the similarity of channel responses at adjacent subcarriers. The proposed neighbor cell search procedure not only includes both PSS and SSS detection, but also can combat different carrier frequency offsets that the home cell signal and the neighbor cell signal may suffer. The removal of the home cell synchronization signals in our algorithm converts the neighbor cell PSS and SSS into new sequences for recognition, respectively. By examining the cross-correlation properties of the new sequences, we show that partial correlation can well detect the neighbor cell sector ID and group ID through the new sequences. From simulation results, it is also clear that the proposed algorithm has good detection results and outperforms the conventional coherent approaches.	carrier frequency;cell signaling;channel state information;coherence (physics);compaq lte;cross-correlation;interference (communication);physical symbol system;search algorithm;simulation;subcarrier	Shun-Fang Liu;Pei-Yun Tsai	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555092	synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;detection theory	Mobile	46.35653815040996	82.23660821120913	187961

Because of the limitation of the hybrid RF/digital beamforming and the adoption of large-scale antennas, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is challenging. By exploiting the joint spatially sparse nature of practical mmWave channels, we develop a novel channel estimation algorithm based on compressive sensing (CS) with low training overhead and computational cost. A multiple measurement vectors (MMV) problem is formulated to exploit the joint sparse structure of the unknown channel, and then solved by the proposed rank-aware channel subspace matching pursuit (RA-CSMP) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of estimation quality in the more scattered channel environments. Moreover, it achieves about 35∼150 times faster runtime than other previous CS-based works in the experiment.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;channel state information;compressed sensing;matching pursuit;multiuse model view;numerical method;overhead (computing);radio frequency;run time (program lifecycle phase);sparse matrix	Cheng-Rung Tsai;Chiang-Hen Chen;Yu-Hsin Liu;An-Yeu Wu	2016	2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905913	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering;precoding	Mobile	43.61844319172353	86.71013384486525	188410

We first investigate an asymptotic behavior of the fully digital (FD) case where the number of radio frequency (RF) chains equals that of antenna elements. Our analysis reveals that the optimal RF filters can be determined by the array response vectors in the asymptotic region without consideration of the baseband (BB) filters. From this observation, we provide a new RF filter design based on the Gram–Schmidt process. Also, in order to manage interpair interference, we design BB filters based on the weighted sum minimum mean square error for given RF filters. Our simulation results demonstrate that as the number of antenna elements grows, our method achieves the optimal FD performance with much reduced computational complexity.	algorithm;baseband;beamforming;computational complexity theory;digital filter;filter design;interference (communication);mean squared error;particle filter;radio frequency;schmidt decomposition;simulation;weight function	Taeseok Oh;Changick Song;Jaein Kim;Seokju Jang;Inkyu Lee	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2837105	asymptotic analysis;electronic engineering;radio frequency;beamforming;computer science;digital filter;interference (wave propagation);minimum mean square error;filter design;baseband	Visualization	42.89506541121291	87.26855601929405	188458

The robust schemes can choose the mode with appropriate number of data streams and corresponding user and receive antenna set to compromise the multiuser spatial multiplexing gain and the rate loss caused by the inter-user interference. The proposed schemes are applicable to the heterogeneous case in which the moving speed of each user is different.

This paper experimentally validates the basic feasibility of the proposed scheme using fabricated prototype; interference suppression performance of the proposed system with STPA-BAA and its interference reduction performance to the conventional system. Exploiting characteristics of constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and power inversion (PI), the transmitter of the proposed system provides two levels of power density for each subcarrier: high and low level. The receiver then uses CMA or PI to appropriately suppress interference on each subcarrier. Low-level subcarrier by the proposed system is also effective in reducing interference to the conventional system which has no interference suppression function. This paper conducts indoor experiments by wired setup of spectrum superposition in two multicarrier systems. Though the practical performance of STPA-BAA is limited due to the quantization level or dynamic range of the transceiver, effectiveness of the proposed scheme is confirmed. Improved operational SIR range of the proposed and the conventional system are presented.	algorithm;batman: arkham asylum;cma-es;channel state information;dynamic range;experiment;high- and low-level;interference (communication);modulus robot;norm (social);prototype;quantization (signal processing);subcarrier;systems design;transceiver;transmitter;zero suppression	Hideya So;Kazuki Maruta;Jun Mashino;Kouhei Suzaki	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881007	transmitter;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;prototype	Mobile	45.49522873600967	84.95469500703238	189455

In CoMP (Coordinated Multiple Point Transmission) scenario, the number of REs (Resource Element) occupied by CSI-RS would be multiplied. However, LTE (Long Term Evolution) legacy UEs (User Equipment) cannot distinguish CSI-RS from data, which may deteriorate the LTE UE's demodulation performance. Therefore it could be troublesome for LTE legacy UEs scheduled in LTE-A network with higher order MIMO equipped, and it is even more serious when CoMP technology is used. Investigation results by both link-level and system-level simulation reveal that LTE legacy UEs performance is seriously degraded due to the impact of CSI-RS when coding rate and modulation order go higher. To reduce the performance degeneration, an improved scheduling algorithm named AUP-AMCS (Advanced UE Prioritization combined with Adaptive Modulation Coding Scheme) is proposed in this paper. Compared to existing algorithm, AUP-AMCS algorithm takes UE priority into consideration and is compatible with the established specification. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve system performance obviously.	acceptable use policy;agile unified process;algorithm;cosmo-rs;csi-dos;channel state information;compaq lte;data integrity;international journal of applied mathematics and computer science;mimo;modulation;reed–solomon error correction;scheduling (computing);system-level simulation	Xiaofei Zhao;Xinyu Gu;Yi Gong;Lin Zhang;Wenyu Li	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341071	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	43.53005200349614	81.88558757472869	189566

In the first technique, the constellation of interest, C, is matched directly to an auxiliary constellation that can be readily Gray labelled. The optimal matching in this technique can be obtained efficiently, but its application is limited to cases in which an auxiliary constellation with a geometric structure that resembles that of C can be identified. In the second technique no auxiliary constellation is required and the labels are generated by matching the distance spectrum of C with that of a hypothetical constellation that is assumed to be perfectly Gray labelled. Optimal matching in this case is computationally prohibitive. Instead, an efficient suboptimal matching algorithm is proposed. When compared with several existing schemes, the proposed labellings provide better performance in both uncoded and BICM-based non-coherent MIMO systems with iterative demapping and decoding (IDD). Furthermore, with the proposed labels, the Grassmannian-based BICM-IDD scheme performs better than a training-based counterpart that employs the Golden code and optimal demapping.	algorithm;coherence (physics);flamsteed designation;iterative method;mimo;matched filter;optimal matching;polynomial	Geoffrey W.

In this paper, under the conditions of unsaturated traffic and finite-length buffer, we investigate the queuing characters of two representative categories of MIMO systems, namely the BLAST system and the space-time block coding (STBC) system. We model the service processes of both STBC and BLAST coupled with AMC, which is the most challenging part of the queuing analysis. We observe a new tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing in terms of link layer packet loss rate and queuing delay, based on which we propose a cross-layer design of diversity-multiplexing switching scheme to optimize the QoS of the MIMO-AMC systems.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;blast;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;network packet;queuing delay;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency	Sheng Zhou;Kai Zhang;Zhisheng Niu;Yang Yang	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.639	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;statistics;computer network	Embedded	40.383298036888704	81.81695378225002	191441
6d0a3b5faf57593c0e19bb7ba918663ca7b1fdd7	channel estimation and rate analysis for multipair massive mimo relaying with one-bit quantization		We study the impact of using one-bit analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters in a multipair amplify-and-forward MIMO relaying system. The relay estimates the channel state information using training data, and then uses the channel estimate to perform maximum ratio combining and maximum ratio transmission. An exact achievable rate is derived for the system under general assumptions on the quantization noise, and then a closed-form asymptotic approximation is derived, which enables efficient evaluation of the impact of key parameters on system performance. Contrary to the conventional unquantized systems, the performance is seen to depend on the specific pilot sequences that are employed. In addition, the sum rate gap between the double quantized relay system and an ideal unquantized system is shown to be a factor of $4/\pi^2$ in the low source power regime.	analog-to-digital converter;approximation;approximation algorithm;channel state information;digital-to-analog converter;key;mimo;quantization (signal processing);relay	Chuili Kong;Amine Mezghani;Caijun Zhong;A.

The major issue is to control the increased co-channel-interference (CCI) caused by CSIT error among users sharing the same time-frequency resource. We propose an advanced joint multiuser precoding and scheduling technique, which uses the statistical information of the CSIT error to predict the relationship among CCI, precoding matrixes and scheduling results, and utilizes such information to improve the precoding and scheduling algorithms for better CCI control. Simulation results have shown that considerable capacity improvement can be achieved by the proposed technique in the case of imperfect CSIT.	algorithm;channel state information;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;multi-user mimo;multiuser dos;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Keying Wu;Lei Wang;Liyu Cai	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.67	transmitter;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;precoding;statistics	Robotics	40.0539201130092	85.07665134020732	191962

Those results inspire the development of real systems that diagonalize the MIMO channel and adaptively control the modulation on each of the resulting subchannels. In this paper we study the design of a fully adaptive transmitter, where transmit filtering and adaptive modulation is controlled by short-term as well as long-term channel state information (channel correlation), where the focus is on channels with correlated fading at transmitter and receiver array. To this end we are motivating the use of long-term channel Eigen modes by capacity-independent considerations.

Because several WLAN systems are concurrently operated in the 2.4 GHz band, the interference from other systems needs to be considered. The proposed method mitigates interference both in own system and that from other WLAN systems. The method is based on a measurement result obtained with a survey tool. A technique for reducing the number of channel allocation patterns is introduced to search for adequate channel allocation, and it was confirmed that the computation time could be reduced to less than hundredth that required for the simple exhaustive search method. Both computer simulations and actual measurements demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.	brute-force search;channel (communications);computation;computer simulation;interference (communication);time complexity	Kenya Yonezawa;Takashi Inoue	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.431	computer simulation;electronic engineering;frequency allocation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;brute-force search;interference;computer network	Embedded	42.55796888078863	84.18875386883866	195049

We use a new nonlinear (NL) coding allowing to obtain a third-order block-Tucker2 model for the signals received by multiple receive antennas, with a constrained structure for the core tensors that ensures the uniqueness of the tensor model. Assuming that the users’ code matrices are mutually orthogonal and known at the receiver, we derive a blind algorithm composed of two steps: a separation of users’ contributions in the received signals, with decoding, followed by a blind channel and symbol estimation for each user separately. Some simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed blind receiver. & 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Several Rake implementations have been proposed in the past, in order to reduce the number of the estimated and combined paths. To this aim, we introduce two adaptive Rake receivers, which combine a subset of the resolvable paths considering simultaneously the quality of both the total combining output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the individual SNR of each path. These schemes achieve better adaptation to channel conditions compared to other known receivers, without further increasing the complexity. Their performance is evaluated in different practical UWB channels, whose models are based on extensive propagation measurements. The proposed receivers compromise between the power consumption, complexity and performance gain for the additional paths, resulting in important savings in power and computational resources.

1eb15849b3b2a0a0844bb9d73ed9909f77083f48	adaptive pilot allocation algorithm for pilot contamination mitigation in tdd massive mimo systems		The pilot contamination problem is one of the major obstacles that limit the performance of time-division duplex (TDD) multicell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Pilot contamination results from the re-use of the same set of pilot sequences in the different cells of the system. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Pilot Allocation (APA) algorithm for pilot contamination mitigation. The proposed algorithm divides the users in the system into two groups according to the inter-cell interference they cause to the other users in the system. To improve the system performance, the algorithm allocates orthogonal pilot sequences to the users that can cause high inter-cell interference. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional (random) allocation method. Also it show that the proposed algorithm improves both the minimum and the mean achievable rates.	algorithm;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mimo;numerical analysis;pilot ace;simulation;test-driven development	Makram Alkhaled;Emad Alsusa;Khairi Ashour Hamdi	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925885	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications	Metrics	40.00343364776783	85.129032691718	196266
de1108cbbf2c15bd76a88a18bb6cfe549621630a	coordinated interference mitigation precoding in unsynchronized small cell lte networks		Next generation long term evolution (LTE) systems evolve towards small cell networks (SCNs) to enable the tremendous data growth through extreme frequency reuse. However, shrinking the cell size to boost the spectral efficiency comes at the expense of increased co-channel interference (CCI) and is the dominant limiting factor from achieving higher network capacities. Consequently, downlink (DL) scenarios in the cell edge become particularly crucial, as the user equipment (UE) is typically surrounded with multiple interfering small cells. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we focus on cooperative interference mitigation schemes where UEs in good channel condition empower the cell edge UE to mitigate the CCI through linear precoding schemes. We provide a practical realization of the cooperative interference mitigation precoding scheme and determine the set of reference signal configuration to enable the promised performance in unsynchronized SCNs with varying timing offsets (TOs) among the receive signals. With simulation results at the link level, we show that estimating and compensating the TO reliable channel state information (CSI) can be achieved for the non- colliding CSI mapping scheme and as a result near optimum DL transmission can be achieved at the cell edge UE in practical SCNs.	algorithm;csi-dos;catastrophic interference;channel state information;compaq lte;interference (communication);internet relay chat;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transponder timing	Stanislaus Iwelski;Erfan Majeed;Zijian Bai;Guido Horst Bruck;Peter Jung	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417397	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;reliability;interference;statistics	Metrics	40.960484901968094	85.2147870220848	197563

This work focuses on the performance of OFDM when used as a modulation and access technique for the uplink of an interactive wireless broadcasting system. In such an application, we present our investigations of the effects of symbol timing misalignments and peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). Under the condition of the same side information bits, the selective mapping (SLM) approach can be implemented by decimating OFDM samples, which is less complex compared to the ordinary SLM incurring a slight degradation of the PAR performance. Taking into account the effects of clipping operation and symbol timing misalignment, the bit error rate (BER) and throughput performances are investigated for a typical OFDMA uplink scenario.	ampersand;bit error rate;decimation (signal processing);elegant degradation;frequency divider;itil;modulation;performance;return channel;telecommunications link;terrestrial television;throughput;wavelength-division multiplexing;x.690	Young-Hwan You;Wongi Jeon;Jungwook Wee;Sang-Tae Kim;Intae Hwang;Hyoung-Kyu Song	2005	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2005.851089	electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	41.28347023854907	81.85601745974436	198675
