c6c90e82f9758bf459209e4b2332e8efd07202f2	a new multistage medical segmentation method based on superpixel and fuzzy clustering	software;brain;computer graphics;image processing computer assisted;fuzzy logic;cluster analysis;brain mapping;magnetic resonance imaging;reproducibility of results;models statistical;algorithms;humans	The medical image segmentation is the key approach of image processing for brain MRI images. However, due to the visual complex appearance of image structures and the imaging characteristic, it is still challenging to automatically segment brain MRI image. A new multi-stage segmentation method based on superpixel and fuzzy clustering (MSFCM) is proposed to achieve the good brain MRI segmentation results. The MSFCM utilizes the superpixels as the clustering objects instead of pixels, and it can increase the clustering granularity and overcome the influence of noise and bias effectively. In the first stage, the MRI image is parsed into several atomic areas, namely, superpixels, and a further parsing step is adopted for the areas with bigger gray variance over setting threshold. Subsequently, designed fuzzy clustering is carried out to the fuzzy membership of each superpixel, and an iterative broadcast method based on the Butterworth function is used to redefine their classifications. Finally, the segmented image is achieved by merging the superpixels which have the same classification label. The simulated brain database from BrainWeb site is used in the experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that MSFCM method outperforms the traditional FCM algorithm in terms of segmentation accuracy and stability for MRI image.	algorithm;butterworth filter;classification;cluster analysis;entity name part qualifier - adopted;experiment;ferric carboxymaltose solution;fosfomycin;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy cognitive map;greater;image processing;image segmentation;iterative method;medical image;multistage amplifier;numerous;parsing;physical object;pixel;sample variance;stage level 1;time complexity;biologic segmentation;interest;statistical cluster	Shiyong Ji;Benzheng Wei;Zhen Yu;Gongping Yang;Yilong Yin	2014		10.1155/2014/747549	fuzzy logic;computer vision;radiology;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;data mining;image segmentation;cluster analysis;computer graphics;scale-space segmentation;brain mapping	Vision	42.766610510337834	-72.37081170982151	180427
dc87c9591e122a20bd11affd99c850a00d56f0b6	intelligent medical image segmentation using evolving fuzzy sets	image segmentation;doctoral thesis;evolving fuzzy sets	Image segmentation is an important step in the image analysis process. Current image segmentation techniques, however, require that the user tune several parameters in order to obtain maximum segmentation accuracy, a computationally inefficient approach, especially when a large number of images must be processed sequentially in real time. Another major challenge, particularly with medical image analysis, is the discrepancy between objective measures for assessing and guiding the segmentation process, on the one hand, and the subjective perception of the end users (e.g., clinicians), on the other. Hence, the setting and adjustment of parameters for medical image segmentation should be performed in a manner that incorporates user feedback. Despite the substantial number of techniques proposed in recent years, accurate segmentation of digital images remains a challenging task for automated computer algorithms. Approaches based on machine learning hold particular promise in this regard because, in many applications, including medical image analysis, frequent user intervention can be assumed as a means of correcting the results, thereby generating valuable feedback for algorithmic learning. This thesis presents an investigation of the use of evolving fuzzy systems for designing a method that overcomes the problems associated with medical image segmentation. An evolving fuzzy system can be trained using a set of invariant features, along with their optimum parameters, which act as a target for the system. Evolving fuzzy systems are also capable of adjusting parameters based on online updates of their rule base. This thesis proposes three different approaches that employ an evolving fuzzy system for the continual adjustment of the parameters of any medical image segmentation technique. The first proposed approach is based on evolving fuzzy image segmentation (EFIS). EFIS can adjust the parameters of existing segmentation methods and switch between them or fuse their results. The evolving rules have been applied for breast ultrasound images, with EFIS being used to adjust the parameters of three segmentation methods: global thresholding, region growing, and statistical region merging. The results for ten independent experiments for each of the three methods show average increases in accuracy of 5%, 12% and 9% respectively. A comparison of the EFIS results with those obtained using five other thresholding methods revealed improvements. On the other hand, EFIS has some weak points, such as some fixed parameters and an inefficient feature calculation process.	algorithm;digital image;discrepancy function;electronic flight instrument system;experiment;fuzzy control system;fuzzy set;image analysis;image segmentation;machine learning;medical image computing;medical imaging;region growing;rule-based system;statistical region merging;thresholding (image processing)	Ahmed A.

fda5d212c729a90cb2cd66c6abf480d4d04e0444	detection of arterial lumen in sonographic images based on active contours and diffusion filters	carotid artery lumen;active contour;robust estimator;point location;segmentation;gold standard;energy function;ultrasound imaging;ultrasound image;carotid artery;sensitivity analysis;complex diffusion;parametric active contours;active contour model	This paper presents a scheme for extracting carotid artery contours from ultrasound images using a modified active contour model. The scheme uses a single seed point as an input. A complex diffusion filter is used to provide a robust estimation of the image's edge map. This edge map is used to define the external energy function for the proposed active contour. The scheme produces accurate results compared to the gold standard images. Moreover, the proposed snake model was compared to two snake models found in literature. While the first model uses Canny edge detector, the second employs the Sobel operator to calculate the image's edge map. Experimental results over a set of 40 images show that the proposed model outperforms the other two models. Finally, sensitivity analysis over the entire set of test images revealed that the scheme is insensitive to the seed point location, as long as it is located inside the artery area.		Amr R.

26f8dd26351b2c99cbd3a64834968d970c3967ce	a kernel fuzzy clustering infrared image segmentation algorithm based on histogram and spatial restraint	histograms;kernel;image segmentation;gray scale;clustering algorithms;correlation;algorithm design and analysis	Because the contrast of the image for guiding the high-speed infrared air-to-air missile is low, its signal to noise ratio is poor and the target and its background gray-scale coupling is strong, the paper analyzes the reasons why the threshold value segmentation method and the fuzzy C-means clustering method have the over-segmentation and under-segmentation in segmenting the above type of image. Hence we propose the kernel fuzzy clustering segmentation algorithm based on histogram and spatial constraint, which utilizes the global first-moment histogram of the infrared image to restrict the number of clusters and the clustering center, improves the spatial correlation function that fully manifests the correlations among pixels inside a neighbor domain and reconstructs the membership degree matrix and the clustering central function, thus segmenting the infrared image with the kernel fuzzy clustering algorithm. The results on the experiments on a sequential infrared image show preliminarily that, compared with the traditional threshold value segmentation algorithm, the fuzzy C-means segmentation algorithm and the kernel fuzzy clustering algorithm, the improved algorithm proposed in the paper can reduce entropy segmentation by about 60% on average and increase the correlation degrees among clusters by around 10%, thus enhancing to a certain extent the efficiency and precision for segmenting the fuzzy image whose target gray-scale and background gray-scale are strongly coupled.	algorithm;cluster analysis;degree matrix;experiment;first-order predicate;fuzzy clustering;grayscale;image segmentation;iteration;kernel (operating system);mcgurk effect;pixel;signal-to-noise ratio	Shaoyi Li;Jun Ma	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852728	correlation clustering;algorithm design;computer vision;data stream clustering;range segmentation;kernel;k-medians clustering;fuzzy clustering;flame clustering;computer science;canopy clustering algorithm;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;cure data clustering algorithm;histogram;mathematics;region growing;image segmentation;cluster analysis;scale-space segmentation;correlation;grayscale	Vision	43.66816279011927	-71.00352729122991	181479

Artificial color uses the projection of the spectrum into wo or more broad, overlapping spectral bands to discriminate, pixel y pixel, among user-defined classes of objects. As initially praciced, it used a sequence of hyperspherical regions of the decision pace to define class membership. Of course, a hypersphere is just degenerate hyperellipsoid; thus, exploring the effect of loosening hat degeneracy seemed appropriate. Initially, we use two-foci hyerellipsoids with a hyperellipsoidal distance metric to classify pixels ith dramatic improvement in performance. We explore the work ven further by allowing many foci and noting the effects of inreased complexity of the decision surfaces. In the example case, hree foci gave superior performance to one or two foci, but four dded little improvement. © 2010 SPIE and IS&T.

The proposed technique, based on distinct region features and fuzzy logic principles, is designed to cope with the problems inherent in the segmentation task that the traditional merging cost functions cannot overcome. It combines the global (color) and local (spatial) information of the image to compare two adjacent regions in the rgb space. The validity of the approach has been subjectively and objectively verified for several types of color images such as head and shoulders, natural and texture images.	color;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule	Sokratis Makrogiannis;George Economou;Spiros Fotopoulos	2001	IJPRAI	10.1142/S0218001401000861	fuzzy logic;computer vision;knowledge base;vector processor;color image;image processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;mathematics;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	43.440525437337655	-66.53221581795745	183069

Most of classic segmentation methods consider a homogeneous patch as an object, while the recorded cell images have rich details and a lot of small inhomogeneous patches, as well as some artifacts, which can impede the applications. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a hierarchical mergence approach (HMA) to extract homogeneous patches out and heuristically add them up. Initially, the maximum region of interest (ROI), in which only cell events exist, is drawn by using gradient information as a mask. Then, different levels of blurring based on kernel or grayscale morphological operations are applied to the whole image to produce reference images. Next, each of unconnected regions in the mask is applied with Otsu method independently according to different reference images. Consequently, the segmentation result is generated by the combination of usable patches in all informative layers. The proposed approach is more than simply a fusion of the basic segmentation methods, but a well-organized strategy that integrates these basic methods. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous methods within our datasets.	blurred vision;cell movement;description;flow;gradient descent;grayscale color map;greater than;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;heuristic;inference;information;instrument - device;kernel;mathematical morphology;microscope device component;microscopy, phase-contrast;morphologic artifacts;otsu's method;patch (computing);precondition;raw image format;region of interest;small;anatomical layer;biologic segmentation	Lei Chen;Jianhua Zhang;Shengyong Chen;Yao Lin;Chunyan Yao;Jianwei Zhang	2014		10.1155/2014/758587	computer vision;simulation;computer science;machine learning;cell growth;algorithm;computer graphics (images)	Vision	39.86104986982321	-73.05183793166886	183565

Suppressed fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. Pattern Recognition Lett. 24, 1607–1612]. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple, and is able to select the parameter a in S-FCM with a prototype-driven learning. The parameter selection is based on the exponential separation strength between clusters. Numerical examples will serve to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MS-FCM algorithm. Finally, the S-FCM and MS-FCM algorithms are applied in the segmentation of the magnetic resonance image (MRI) of an ophthalmic patient. In our comparisons of S-FCM, MS-FCM, alternative FCM (AFCM) proposed by [Wu, K.L., Yang, M.S., 2002. Alternative c-means clustering algorithms. Pattern Recognition 35, 2267–2278] and similarity-based clustering method (SCM) proposed by [Yang, M.S., Wu, K.L., 2004. A similarity-based robust clustering method. IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Machine Intell. 26, 434–448] for these MRI segmentation results, we find that these four techniques provide useful information as an aid to diagnosis in ophthalmology. However, the MS-FCM provides better detection of abnormal tissue than S-FCM, AFCM and SCM when based on a window selection. Overall, the MS-FCM clustering algorithm is more efficient and is strongly recommended as an MRI segmentation technique. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

f7f596476e0b52c48f7b4ddf699c2c7d85832dab	detection of root knot nematodes in microscopy images		Object detection in microscopy image is essential for further analysis in many applications. However, images are not always easy to analyze due to uneven illumination and noise. In addition, objects may appear merged together with debris. This work presents a method for detecting rice root knot nematodes in microscopy images. The problem involves four subproblems which are dealt with separately. The uneven illumination is corrected via polynomial fitting. The nematodes are then highlighted using mathematical morphology. A binary image is obtained and the microscope lines are removed. Finally, the detected nematodes are counted after thresholding the non-nematode particles. The results obtained from the performed tests show that this is a reliable and effective method when compared to manual counting.	binary image;effective method;mathematical morphology;object detection;polynomial;rice's theorem;sensor;thresholding (image processing)	Faroq Al-Tam;António dos Anjos;Stephane Bellafiore;Hamid Reza Shahbazkia	2015			microscope;binary image;computer vision;chemistry;polynomial;object detection;microscopy;artificial intelligence;thresholding;mathematical morphology;effective method	Vision	39.31520520036545	-72.2940444976191	183928

The method uses classification to group pixels into homogeneous regions. Both global and local information are taken into account. This is particularly helpful in taking care of small objects and local variation of color images. Color, mean and standard deviation are used as a data source. The classification is achieved by a new version of self-organizing maps algorithm . This new algorithm is equivalent to classic fuzzy C-mean algorithm (FCM) whose objective function has been modified. Code vectors that constitute centers of classes, are distributed on a regular low dimension grid. In addition, a penalization term is added to guarantee a smooth distribution of the values of the code vectors on the grid. Tests achieved on color images, followed by an automatic evaluation revealed the good performances of the proposed method.	color image;image segmentation	Fella Hachouf;Nassima Mezhoud	2005		10.1007/11558484_65	color histogram;computer vision;contextual image classification;self-organization;color image;image processing;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;mathematics;image segmentation;standard deviation	Vision	44.803461543470426	-67.20061089731867	185534

A novel clustering-based compression work connected to cloud databases is proposed for the applications of telemedicine and long-term care in this study, where the goal is to enhance information transfer rate and storage capacity to further improve communication between medical staffs and patients in long-term care and telemedicine. The proposed system mainly involves three-dimensional histogram competitive Hopfield neural network (CHNN) clustering, regionalization, and modified block truncation coding (BTC). Three-dimensional histogram CHNN clustering and regionalization are proposed to achieve better clustering accuracy within three-dimensional spaces and simultaneously overcome the problems of fluctuating initial values of clustering. Modified BTC is also proposed to analyze clustering regions with different compression rates according to their importance in order to greatly preserve important image feature information under the condition of smaller image sizes. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system is adaptive and performs better than several previous methods. It is also suggested being suitable for the applications of telemedicine and long-term care connected to cloud databases.	database	Wei-Yen Hsu	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2016.05.010	data stream clustering;simulation;computer science;data science;cure data clustering algorithm;data mining	ML	42.51154616459976	-72.60019806835923	187338

In this paper we investigate mean shift segmentation on multispectral and hyperspectral images and propose three new algorithms. First, we improve segmentation performance by running mean shift on the spectral gradient. At the same time, we adapt a popular superpixel segmentation method to the multispectral domain using modified similarity measures from spectral mapping. Based on superpixels, we design two mean shift variants that both obtain competitive segmentation results in significantly reduced running time. For one variant, the speedup in our benchmark is over 100 times. This enables mean shift clustering in an interactive setting.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;gradient;image analysis;image segmentation;mean shift;multispectral image;speedup;time complexity	Johannes Jordan;Elli Angelopoulou	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738781	computer vision;computer science;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;multispectral pattern recognition;region growing;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	45.15756066429078	-68.83868125155959	187741

We propose a new active contour model, which converges reliably even when the initialization is far from the object of interest. The proposed segmentation technique uses an external energy function where the energy slowly decreases in the vicinity of an edge. This new energy function is calculated using an efficient dual scan line algorithm. The proposed energy function is tested on computational speed, its effect on the convergence speed of the active contour and the segmentation result. The proposed method gets similar segmentation results as the gradient vector flow active contours, but the energy function needs much less time to calculate.	active contour model;algorithm;dual scan;gradient;mathematical optimization;scan line;software propagation	Jonas De Vylder;Wilfried Philips	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2010.5654343	computer vision;mathematical optimization;image analysis;computer science;pattern recognition;active contour model;mathematics;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	45.712539168074386	-71.19415017960358	187780

Pepper plants were shot from above once per week in the greenhouse since being field planted in spring. The method of processing the pepper plant images was studied, in which the image segmentation of combination of color space and the image morphological operations were applied.

ABSTRACT Fully automatic segmentation on medical images often generate s unreliable results so we must rely on semi-automatic methods that use both user input and boundary refinement to pr oduce a more accurate result. In this paper, we present an improved livewire method for noisy regions of interest with low contrast boundaries. The first improvement is the adaptive search space, which mi nimizes the required search area for graph ge neration, and a directional graph searching which also speeds up the shortest path finding. The second improvement is an enhanced cost function to consider only the local maximum gradient within our search area, which pr events interference from objects we are not interested in. The third improvement is the on-the-fly training based on gradient histogram to prevent attraction of the contour to strong edges that are not part of the actual contour. We carried out tests between the original and our improved version of livewire. The segmentation was validated on phantom images and also against manual segmentation defined by experts on uterine leiomyomas MRI. Our results show that, on average, our method reduces the time to completion by 96% with improved accuracy up to 63%. Keywords: interactive segmentation, livewire 1. INTRODUCTION Fully automatic segmentation on medical images often generate s unreliable results so we must rely on semi-automatic methods that use both user input and boundary refinement to produce a more accurate result. Difficulty increases dramatically when attempting to segment regions that are very noisy and which have discontinuous or low contrast boundaries. We propose using the interactive segmentation method known as live wire along with some improvements to graph generation, cost function, and on-the-fly training to better segment these regions of interest. Interactive segmentation methods that re quire user assistance range from comple te manual drawing of object boundaries to detection of object regions with minimal user assistance [1]. Thus goals of research in interactive segmentation should be to increase the accuracy while minimizing user involvement and decreasing the total users time for segmentation. Some popular approaches in interactive segmentation are snakes (active contour models), ASM, and the method we use, Livewire. The snake method uses an initial approximation of an objects boundary and iteratively minimizes a corresponding energy function to locate the actual contour [2]. ASM searches for boundaries by applying flexible statistical models garnered from training data sets [3]. A method for interactive segmentation that we use and that has been detailed in previous literature is known as livewire (intelligent scissors) which was introduced in 1992 [4,5]. Livewire is a user-steered method that relies on finding the minimal path between nodes in a weighted graph whose cost from one node to another are dependent on a predefined cost function. This shortest path represents the suggested contour that minimizes the cost from the users current mouse position in regards to the start position. It allows for an opt imal balance between user interaction and automatic analysis needed for medical image segmentation. More recently, approaches using live wire have been applied to 3D segmentation. Souza et.al [6] gives an approach known as iterative live user steered 3-D image segmentation. In this method livewire results from one slice is propagated to subsequent slices by projecting the midpoints of livewire segments onto the new slices to act as anchor points. Lu et al. [7] uses a 3D live-wire method and applies it to CT chest image analysis.	livewire segmentation technique	David Chen;Jianhua Yao	2007		10.1117/12.709934	computer vision;simulation;livewire segmentation technique;computer science;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	45.972590799758734	-70.84637471665191	188442

The image getting from the vision sensor is color image in our system. Therefore, CIE L*a*b* color space is selected to express the color image in this proposed method at first. Then, the segmentation for the effective color feature component is made using FCM segmentation method. After that, the component with the desired characteristics can be obtained and transferred into binary image for further processing. Lastly, the mathematical morphology method with geometric characteristic is used to extract the largest connected component as the ideal result, and to mark the center and bound rectangle of the recognized fruit.

For this reason it would be useful to obtain an automatic segmentation and enrichment of lines in order to apply to each section the best algorithm and the appropriate parameter. In this paper we present a methodology for applying a line-classifying backpropagation artificial neural network (BANN) for a line segmentation task. The procedure is based on the use of a moving window along the line to detect changes in the sinuosity and directionality of the line. A summary of the BANN design is presented, and a test is performed over a set of roads from a 1:25k scale map with a recommendation of the value of the parameters of the moving window.

It uses color distance map (CDM) and an algorithm based on the property of flow of water. The CDM itself is a grayscale image, which makes the algorithm very simple. However, it is still capable of providing color information based on which some skin and non-skin seed regions can be determined reliably. Then a water-flow based procedure determines skin and non-skin segments completely. The color distance map is robust against variations in imaging conditions and the water-flow procedure efficiently uses the region information to extract solid skin segments without generating much noisy segments.	algorithm;color;conceptual schema;distance transform;grayscale;skin (computing);trionic	Mohammad Abdullah-Al-Wadud;Oksam Chae	2008	2008 The Fourth International Conference on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/IAS.2008.65	computer vision;geography;pattern recognition;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	44.02911981175582	-66.38734220292245	192180

In this paper, we propose a novel superpixel segmentation method based on an iterative and adaptive clustering algorithm that embraces color, contour, texture, and spatial features together. The algorithm adjusts the weights of different features automatically in a content-aware way, so as to fit the requirements of various image instances. More specifically, in each iteration, the weights in the aggregation function are adjusted according to the discriminabilities of features in the current working scenario. This way, the algorithm not only possesses improved robustness but also relieves the burden of setting the parameters manually. Experimental verification shows that the algorithm outperforms existing peer algorithms in terms of commonly used evaluation metrics, while using a low computational cost.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;align (company);cluster analysis;computation;iteration;pixel;requirement;robustness (computer science)	Xiaolin Xiao;Yue-jiao Gong;Yicong Zhou	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952487	pixel;robustness (computer science);algorithm design;computer science;scale-space segmentation;pattern recognition;cluster analysis;image segmentation;image texture;computer vision;segmentation-based object categorization;artificial intelligence	Vision	45.87037527447358	-68.55819173311224	192764

For multi-object segmentation, the algorithm uses Chebyshev inequality and the kernel density estimation method to do background modeling firstly. Then in order to classify image pixels as background points, foreground points and suspicious points, an adaptive threshold algorithm is proposed accordingly. After using background subtraction to get the ideal foreground image, region growing method is used for multi-object segmentation. Here, we improved the region growing method by introducing the growth seed concept for multi-object segmentation, which is calculated from the sparse matrix of quad-tree decomposition. Experimental results show that Chebyshev inequalities can quickly distinguish the foreground and background points. Multi-object segmentation results are satisfactory through seed-based region growing method. Comparison and analysis the experimental results show that the proposed BMRG algorithm is feasible, rapid and effective.	algorithm;region growing	Kun Zhang;Cuirong Wang;Baoyan Wang	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31346-2_13	kernel density estimation;computer vision;mathematical optimization;chebyshev's inequality;computer science;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;mathematics;region growing;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation;statistics	Vision	45.38225481856665	-67.78833341293826	194075

On the basis of the technologies, a software “Crack Image Analysis System” (CIAS) has been developed. An image of soil crack network is used as an example to illustrate the image processing technologies and the operations of the CIAS. The quantification of the crack image involves the following three steps: image segmentation, crack identification and measurement. First, the image is converted to a binary image using a cluster analysis method; noise in the binary image is removed; and crack spaces are fused. Then, the medial axis of the crack network is extracted from the binary image, with which nodes and crack segments can be identified. Finally, various geometric parameters of the crack network can be calculated automatically, such as node number, crack number, clod area, clod perimeter, crack area, width, length, and direction. The thresholds used in the operations are specified by cluster analysis and other innovative methods. As a result, the objects (nodes, cracks and clods) in the crack network can be quantified automatically. The software may be used to study the generation and development of soil crack patterns and rock fractures. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-thresholding is an important operation in many analyses which is used in many applications. Selecting correct thresholds to get better result is a critical issue. In this research, a multilevel thresholding method is proposed based on combination of maximum entropy. The maximum entropy thresholding algorithm selects several threshold values by maximizing the cross entropy between the original image and the segmented image. This method can effectively integrate partial range of the image histogram. The proposed algorithm is compared with single thresholding method based on maximum entropy and multilevel thresholding method The proposed multi thresholding method is tested on license plate application.

The two-dimensional maximum entropy image segmentation method often gets ideal segmentation results for it not only considers the distribution of the gray information, but also takes advantage of the spatial neighbor information with using the two-dimensional histogram of the image. However it requires a large amount of computing time. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, a new particle swarm optimization algorithm which can guarantee the global convergence, was proposed to solve this problem in the paper. The simulation was performed using QPSO algorithm to seek the optimal threshold value of an image adaptively in the two-dimensional gray space, where is the pixel intensity and is the average intensity of the pixel's neighborhood. The experiments of segmenting the vehicle brand images are illustrated to show that the proposed method can get ideal segmentation result with less computation cost.	algorithm;computation;converge;cybernetics;experiment;image processing;image segmentation;local convergence;mathematical optimization;maximal set;particle swarm optimization;pixel;principle of maximum entropy;quantum;simulation	Xiujuan Lei;Ali Fu	2008	2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2008.822	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;morphological gradient;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;mathematics;region growing;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Robotics	43.21389120193486	-68.66186267066627	194306

We propose a candidacy graph, whose vertices are two types of recognition candidates for either a superpixel or a window patch. The superpixel candidates are generated by a discriminative classifier with textural features as well as the window proposals by a learned deformable templates model in the bottom-up steps. The contextual and competitive interactions between graph vertices, in form of probabilistic connecting edges, are defined by two types of contextual metrics and the overlapping of their image domain, respectively. With this representation, a composite clustering sampling algorithm is proposed to fast search the optimal convergence globally using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Our approach is applied on both lotus hill institute (LHI) and MSRC public datasets and achieves the state-of-art results.	algorithm;bottom-up parsing;cluster analysis;connected component (graph theory);discriminative model;feasible region;information privacy;interaction;local interconnect network;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;object detection;pattern recognition;pixel;sampling (signal processing);shape context	Quan Zhou;Wenyu Liu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-19318-7_30	computer vision;markov chain monte carlo;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;top-down and bottom-up design;cluster sampling;statistics	Vision	45.94245867936786	-68.89473447749519	195307

However in the case of noisy MR images, efficiency of this algorithm considerably reduces. Recently, researchers have been introduced two new parameters in order to improve performance of traditional FCM in the case of noisy images. New parameters are computed using artificial neural networks and through an optimization problem, where need complex and time consuming computations. In this paper, we present a new method for efficient computation of these two parameters. We used genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method and showed capability of GA for finding optimal values of these parameters. Simplification of computation is advantage of new proposed method. Simulation results using noisy MR images, demonstrated effectiveness of proposed optimization method for noisy MR image segmentation. 1.

The proposed algorithm employs efficient schemes for reinforcing proximity to Pareto-optimal and diversity of solutions. They are designed to solve multiobjective problems for segmentation accuracy and speed. First objective is evaluated by difference between the segmented outline and ground truth. Second objective is evaluated by elapsed time during segmentation process. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with conventional MOEA from the viewpoint of proximity to the Pareto-optimal front (improved by 16.4% and 12.4%). Moreover, segmentation results of proposed algorithm describe faster segmentation speed (1.97 second) and higher accuracy (8% Jaccard).	active contour model;evolutionary algorithm;ground truth;image segmentation;jaccard index;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;neoplasms;pareto efficiency;performance evaluation;population parameter;published comment;solutions;ultrasonography, mammary;biologic segmentation	Ye-Hoon Kim;Baek Hwan Cho;Yeong Kyeong Seong;Moon Ho Park;Junghoe Kim;Sinsang Yu;Kyoung-Gu Woo	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610334	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation;evolutionary computation	Robotics	42.40940444007435	-72.82116758680984	196511

In this paper, we show that superpixels (image segments) can provide powerful grouping cues to guide segmentation, where superpixels can be collected easily by (over)-segmenting the image using any reasonable existing segmentation algorithms. Generated by different algorithms with varying parameters, superpixels can capture diverse and multi-scale visual patterns of a natural image. Successful integration of the cues from a large multitude of superpixels presents a promising yet not fully explored direction. In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation framework based on bipartite graph partitioning, which is able to aggregate multi-layer superpixels in a principled and very effective manner. Computationally, it is tailored to unbalanced bipartite graph structure and leads to a highly efficient, linear-time spectral algorithm. Our method achieves significantly better performance on the Berkeley Segmentation Database compared to state-of-the-art techniques.	aggregate data;algorithm;graph partition;image segmentation;layer (electronics);time complexity;unbalanced circuit	Zhenguo Li;Xiao-Ming Wu;Shih-Fu Chang	2012	2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247750	computer vision;synthetic aperture sonar;bipartite graph;computer science;graph theory;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;mathematics;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	45.734737908500776	-68.86342854398711	196702

This article obtains the fiber outline firstly, and then the edge detection algorithm is applied to the adhesive fibers. Thus, filling algorithm and contour tracking algorithm are used to get the fibers’ outer contour. After that applying the directed graph algorithm to edge detection, and the complete edge is gained after the burr is eliminated. Proven by the experimental results, the proposed edge detection algorithm can overcome the defects of the conventional edge detection algorithm, such fracture as edge, false edge, etc.	algorithm;canny edge detector;contour line;directed graph;edge detection;journal of multimedia;list of algorithms;prewitt operator;systems theory;zero suppression	Ashim Saha;Arundhati Das	2018	JMPT		fiber;directed graph;computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science	Vision	45.103408075311705	-72.51398733071626	199571
