These impairments are relevant when the very high speed of a mobile receiver forces to use a non-directional antenna. First, we compare low-complexity time-domain and frequency-domain block equalizers. Then, we propose a novel frequency-domain equalizer based on a fast Fourier transform (FFT) with size higher than the length of the processed block. Thanks to the increased frequency resolution, the proposed equalizer yields improved performance with respect to the conventional frequency-domain equalizer. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.	adaptive histogram equalization;channel state information;communications satellite;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;global communications conference;handheld game console;i-frame delay;ku band;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;simulation;software propagation;subject matter expert turing test	Luca Rugini;Paolo Banelli;Matteo Berioli	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.952	fast fourier transform;telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science;frequency domain	EDA	44.12457715580975	80.55055832461593	145359

Both increase of throughput and SNR gain are observed through appropriate maximum ratio combining (MRC) of the soft symbols pertaining to the receiver-end diversity branches. The 2×1 multi-user detection (MUD) case has been also addressed to certain extent. Additional gains, essentially related to SISO case, coming from the cooperative use of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) branches, primarily based on the quadrature noise components' independence, as well as from the explicit noise cancellation within the SIC framework, have also been outlined.	bell laboratories layered space-time;digital subchannel;in-phase and quadrature components;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mud;multi-tap;multi-user;noise power;signal-to-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;spectral density;system analysis;throughput	V.

The proposed algorithm introduces two additional UWB channel related parameters in the optimization problem along with the conventional energy criterion. This modification significantly improve the performance of the conventional MSSNR algorithm and enables it to handle the extreme nature of channel shortening needed in UWB systems. We also derive a lower bound for bit error rate (BER) as a comparison bench mark. The proposed algorithm does not need any training or channel estimation and outperforms the conventional MSSNR algorithm in terms of different comparative parameters.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;comparison sort;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;mathematical optimization;modulation;optimization problem;point of view (computer hardware company);rake;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;ultra-wideband;x.690	Syed Imtiaz Husain;Jian Zhang	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.414	optimization problem;time-hopping;real-time computing;index term;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;pulse-width modulation;upper and lower bounds;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;communications system;rake receiver	Robotics	45.32507451991588	75.96275770165411	146145

The output correlation function of instantaneous nonlinear amplifiers and the signal-to-distortion ratio can be derived and expressed in an easy way. As a consequence, the output spectrum and the bit-error rate (BER) performance of OFDM systems in nonlinear additive white Gaussian noise channels are predictable both for uncompensated amplitude modulation/amplitude modulation (AM/AM) and amplitude modulation/pulse modulation (AM/PM) distortions and for ideal predistortion. The aim of this work is to obtain the analytical expressions for the output correlation function of a nonlinear device and for the BER performance. The results in closed-form solutions are derived for AM/AM and AM/PM curves approximated by Bessel series expansion and for the ideal predistortion case.	am broadcasting;additive white gaussian noise;amplifier;approximation algorithm;baseband;bessel filter;bit error rate;distortion;gaussian process;modulation;multiplexing;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;rayleigh–ritz method;series expansion;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Paolo Banelli;Saverio Cacopardi	2000	IEEE Trans.

However, it is a problem for practical engineering application considering the high calculation complexity of IMT-A GBSM channel models. To satisfy requirements from practical engineering applications, we proposed an improved IMT-A GBSM channel model for Urban micro-cellular scenarios. The improved IMT-A GBSM channel model is traded off by the calculation complexity and accuracy. Performance analysis results indicate that the calculation complexity of improved IMT-A GBSM channel model has been obviously reduced and correlation metrics of the improved IMT-A GBSM channel model still kept consistency with the traditional IMT-A GBSM channel model. Therefore, the improved IMT-A GBSM can be used for practical telecommunication engineering applications in UMi scenarios.	channel (communications);computational complexity theory;flexibility method;interactive machine translation;mimo;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;profiling (computer programming);requirement;simulation;stochastic modelling (insurance)	Xueying Song;Xiaohu Ge;Jing Zhang;Tao Han	2014	2014 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2014.7063513	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	40.09684289752872	79.56059249110666	146556

Matching signal processing complexity to the actual correlation conditions and, thus, to the achievable performance is possible with a superset of MRC and BF known as maximal-ratio eigencombining (MREC). For imperfectly known and correlated fading gains, new closed-form expressions are derived for the probability density function of the MREC-output SNR, as well as for the outage probability (OP) and the average error probability. These new expressions permit seamless evaluation for any correlation value of MREC, MRC, and BF performance measures, such as the amount of fading, the deep-fade probability, diversity and array gains, and the OP. Our results confirm that, in realistic scenarios, adaptive MREC can achieve MRC-like performance for BF-like complexity.	analysis of algorithms;angle of arrival;asymptotic equipartition property;beamforming;best, worst and average case;brainfuck;coefficient;downtime;form;like button;maximal set;numerical analysis;os-tan;pre-shared key;seamless3d;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;smart antenna;sun outage	Constantin Siriteanu;Steven D.

For the same spectral efficiency, the trellis-coded modulation (TCM) schemes studied outperform minimum shift keying (MSK) with noncoherent or differentially coherent detection in Rayleigh fading channels. For the case of frequency-selective fading channels, adaptive channel equalization is applied to mitigate the time-variant intersymbol interference (ISI). A new equalizer structure is proposed which, in its feedback path, makes use of fractionally spaced signal samples instead of symbol-spaced hard decisions on transmitted symbols. Computer simulation results indicate that the soft-decision feedback equalizer (SDFE) can significantly improve the system's performance.	bit error rate;carrier recovery;computer cooling;computer simulation;envelope detector;equalization (communications);feedback;information sciences institute;interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation;nonlinear system;rayleigh fading;spectral efficiency;trellis quantization;x.690	Weihua Zhuang;Witold A.

Transmit diversity techniques combined with error control coding have been explored in a new scheme called space-time coding. We apply space-time block codes to multicarrier CDMA systems. The performance of the space-time coded multicarrier CDMA system is demonstrated over time-frequency selective (double selective) fading channel through simulations. Simulation results show that the MC-CDMA systems with transmit diversity perform much better than the MC-CDMA systems without transmit diversity over double selective fading channels.		He Tao;N.

It is shown that if the noise power tends to zero and the system load is less than one, then the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the MOE receiver tends to infinity and the Capon channel estimate converges to a scaled version of the channel vector of the user-of-interest. For the case when the system load is larger than one, an asymptotic SINR expression is obtained. Furthermore, expressions for the efficiency and asymptotic efficiency of the MOE receiver are derived. Simple approximations of (and upper/lower bounds on) these expressions are found and the effects of the system physical parameters on the performance of the MOE receiver are discussed.	approximation;channel state information;interference (communication);load (computing);moe;noise power;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Keyvan Zarifi;Alex B.

Based on the unique characteristic of the LDM and the special structure of a parity-check matrix (PCM) for the core layer, the proposed scheme applies the sum-product algorithm (SPA) to only a part of the PCM. For this reason, it is referred to as “the partial SPA,” compared with the conventional scheme, denoted by “the full SPA.” Clearly, it has a significantly lower complexity than the full SPA. Furthermore, we propose hybrid decoders employing both the full SPA and the partial SPA to achieve a better performance, while maintaining their complexity low. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes have a good performance enough to perform successive interference cancellation for the enhanced layer of the LDM systems in ATSC 3.0 as well as they have a low-complexity merit depending on system parameters. Since they only schedule the decoding procedure without modifying the decoder structure, they also have a benefit in the implementation of decoders.	atsc 3.0;atsc standards;algorithm;belief propagation;binary decoder;interference (communication);iteration;low-density parity-check code;multiplexing;numerical method;parity-check matrix;simplified instructional computer;two-hybrid screening	Youngjun Hwang;Sunghye Cho;Seho Myung;Kyeongcheol Yang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2016.2606896	list decoding;electronic engineering;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;frequency-division multiplexing	HPC	45.97233404891549	80.17582974665973	147342

Several criteria may indicate that a first-order finite-state Markov model sufficiently characterizes the channel behavior. The parameters of the model are obtained both from theoretical analysis and simulation.

In this scheme, a single transmit antenna, which maximizes the total received signal power at the receiver, is selected for uncoded transmission. The closed-form outage probability of the system with transmit antenna selection is presented. The bit error rate (BER) of the TAS/MRC scheme is derived for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) in flat Rayleigh fading channels. The BER analysis demonstrates that the TAS/MRC scheme can achieve a full diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), as if all the transmit antennas were used. The average SNR gain of the TAS/MRC is quantified and compared with those of uncoded receiver MRC and space-time block codes (STBCs). The analytical results are verified by simulation. It is shown that the TAS/MRC scheme outperforms some more complex space-time codes of the same spectral efficiency. The cost of the improved performance is a low-rate feedback channel. We also show that channel estimation errors based on pilot symbols have no impact on the diversity order over quasi-static fading channels.	bit error rate;channel state information;code;downtime;key (cryptography);mimo;mrc (file format);maximal set;modulation;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;thermal-assisted switching;x.690	Zhuo Chen;Branka Vucetic	2005	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2005.851319	block code;electronic engineering;space–time block code;bit error rate;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;rayleigh fading;probability;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;space–time code;diversity combining;fading;maximal-ratio combining;statistics;spectral efficiency	Mobile	41.88005937931665	75.22887623376566	147694

6a7651d6e8d6954b89e3e374df13a9b2f1ec30d9	a low-papr multiplexed mc-cdma system with enhanced data rate and link quality	spectral efficiency;power efficiency	Recently, a new multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) system with cyclic-shift orthogonal keying (CSOK) has been proposed and shown to be more spectral and power efficient than conventional MC-CDMA systems. In this paper, a novel extension called the multiplexed CSOK (MCSOK) MC-CDMA system is proposed to further increase the data rate while maintaining a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). First, the data stream is divided into multiple parallel substreams that are mapped into QPSK-CSOK symbols in terms of cyclic shifted Chu sequences. Second, these sequences are repeated, modulated, summed, and placed on IFFT subcarriers, resulting in a constant-modulus multiplexed signal that preserves the desired orthogonality among substreams. The receiver performs frequency-domain equalization and uses efficient demultiplexing, despreading, and demapping schemes to detect the modulation symbols. Furthermore, an alternate MCSOK system configuration with high link quality is also presented. Simulations show that the proposed MCSOK system attains lower PAPR and BER, as compared to conventional MC-CDMA system using Walsh codes. Under a rich multipath environment, the high link quality configuration exhibits excellent performance with both diversity gain and MCSOK modulation gain.	bluetooth;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference	Juinn-Horng Deng;Jeng-Kuang Hwang	2010	IEICE Transactions		telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;multiplexing	Mobile	45.36440054338365	81.24057614889199	148895

Simple, yet effective, technique to decrease such effects of multipath fading is multiple antennas architecture (diversity). In this paper performance of dual diversity receivers operating over correlated and non-identical Ricean fading channels is analyzed. Various combining schemes, such as MRC (Maximal Ratio Combining), EGC (Equal Gain Combining) and SSC (Switch and Stay Diversity Combining), are considered. For the purpose of those analyses, a new model, based on linear transformation of correlated Ricean random variables into uncorrelated ones, is proposed. In that manner, it is enabled to apply standard procedure for performance analysis used when uncorrelated signals are transmitted over communication channels. MGF (Moment Generating Function) of the received SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is determined, enabling us to find numerically bit error rate (BER) for different modulation schemes. In this paper, the system with BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) mapping of the input data stream is assumed. BER evaluations have been realized for different Ricean channel conditions, that is: for different values of Ricean K factor, correlation coefficient and power imbalance between diversity branches. The obtained results show that the average BER depends on the correlation between diversity branches and their power imbalance. These two parameters significantly affect system performance, no matter which combination technique is implemented. It is also shown that the influence of branch power imbalance on BER is greater than the influence of correlation coefficient.	amiga reflections;bit error rate;coefficient;maximal set;modulation;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);sql server compact;signal reflection;signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Maja Delibasic;Milica Pejanovic;Enis Kocan	2011	2011 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS)	10.1109/WTS.2011.5960897	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;diversity scheme;communication;fading	Mobile	40.98267102501543	76.91245385012822	149075

The redundancy is formed through repeating data symbols across OFDM symbols in both time and frequency. A novel frequency shift (FRESH) filter is applied to exploit the time-varying cyclostationary properties, enabling the communication while under interference. The ability to design an interference mitigating property into the communication signal creates a new degree of freedom when optimizing and adapting a waveform’s parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gains in both signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) and bit error rate (BER) as compared to traditional time-invariant optimal filtering techniques and error correcting codes (ECC).	bit error rate;code;cyclostationary process;error detection and correction;frequency divider;interference (communication);multiplexing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time-invariant system;waveform;x.690	Matt Carrick;Jeffrey H.

More specifically, we study pulse-based ultra wideband (UWB) communications over channels with dense multipath effects using frequency shift keying (FSK) data modulation. Our aim is to explore the performance tradeoffs between high and low complexity receivers. For this purpose we determine the performance of coherent, non-coherent and mismatched (e.g., non-coherent detection using templates consisting of a single path) demodulators. We take into account the influence of the frequency response of the antenna system and the effects of the frequency selectivity of the multipath channel. Given a specific channel condition, we derive expressions for the bit error rate for coherent, noncoherent and mismatched reception of correlated FSK signals with unequal energies, and calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation for different receiver's complexities with a given FSK frequency deviation We show that UWB-FSK has a SNR degradation similar to other low-complexity receivers studied in the literature.	bit error rate;carrier recovery;coherence (physics);elegant degradation;frequency response;key (cryptography);modulation;multipath propagation;selectivity (electronic);signal-to-noise ratio;ultra-wideband	Fernando Ramírez-Mireles;Todor Cooklev;Gustavo A.

Analytical results verify that the proposed system can obtain the fourth order diversity gain, whereas the conventional DSTTD-OFDM system produces the second order diversity gain. We also suggest open-loop power allocation to minimize lower performance bound. Simulation results show that the proposed system outperforms the conventional DSTTD-OFDM system with the ZF-DF detector by about 3.7 dB at the bit error rate (BER) of 10 4. The open-loop power allocation provides additional 1.0 dB performance improvement.	bit error rate;decibel;direction finding;drivespace;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;simulation;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Hyounkuk Kim;Hyuncheol Park	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.844	bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics;diversity gain	Robotics	44.67850093432918	79.20196150133255	149933

cda5999ed0a452bc488b0b4e44a3966b0d012ea3	generalized frequency division multiplexing with space and frequency index modulation		Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) has been regarded as one of the promising candidates for the physical layer (PHY) of fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) friendliness is a key ability for a physical layer scheme to match the foreseen requirements of 5G wireless networks. On the other hand, index modulation (IM) concept, which relies on conveying additional information bits through indices of certain transmit entities, is an emerging technique to provide better spectral efficiency. In this paper, a novel MIMO-GFDM system, which combines GFDM with space and frequency IM (SFIM) technique, is proposed. In the GFDM-SFIM scheme, the transmit antenna, the constellation mode and the classic constellation symbols are determined according to incoming bit stream. The main contribution of the paper is the construction of the GFDM-SFIM system model including joint MIMO detection and GFDM demodulation performed by the GFDM-SFIM receiver. We evaluate the error performance of the GFDM-SFIM scheme as well as prove its superiority by making comparisons with the spatial modulation (SM) GFDM system and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) SFIM system for Rayleigh multipath fading channels.	bitstream;entity;fifth generation computer;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multipath propagation;multiplexing;phy (chip);rayleigh–ritz method;requirement;spectral efficiency	Ersin Öztürk;Ertugrul Basar;Hakan A.

In this paper, we study the effect on channel capacity and error-rate performance of residual Tx-RF impairments that defy proper compensation. In particular, we demonstrate that such residual distortions severely degrade the performance of (near-)optimum MIMO detection algorithms. To mitigate this performance loss, we propose an efficient algorithm, which is based on an i.i.d. Gaussian model for the distortion caused by these impairments. In order to validate this model, we provide measurement results based on a 4-stream Tx-RF chain implementation for MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).	algorithm;bayesian network;channel capacity;decorrelation;distortion;mimo;multiplexing;preprocessor;qr decomposition;radio frequency;sensor;transceiver;whitening transformation	Christoph Studer;Markus Wenk;Andreas Peter Burg	2010	2010 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas (WSA)	10.1109/WSA.2010.5456453	transmitter;detector;multi-user mimo;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;information theory;word error rate;computer science;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;channel capacity;statistics;computer network;mimo	Metrics	45.780035408458076	77.082461601461	150965
c242a2005975af632237538189506406dbe60f9f	improved noise estimation using synchronization sequences in lte downlink		The estimation of the noise power (an important measure of the channel quality used in adaptive modulation, power control, turbo-decoding, and transmission mode switching) is a fundamental step in wireless communication systems. In LTE downlink, every OFDM frame has cell-specific reference symbols (CS-RS), which facilitate the channel, and the noise power estimation. However, the performance of the CS-RS based noise estimation schemes worsens in fast-changing environments. In this work, we propose the use of the synchronization sequences for the noise power estimation which generates an accurate estimate of the noise power at typical operational range of SNR. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is robust in frequency-selective, fast-fading wireless channels, and provides a near ideal estimate of the noise power at the LTE operating frequencies.	cs-cipher;compaq lte;modulation;noise power;reed–solomon error correction;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Tulika Agrawal;S.

In connection with the hybrid MC/VSF and precoding scheme, a novel two-stage -symbol group detection is introduced to maximize the detection gain by collecting all the signal energy carried over the entire MC channels. With fixed , the symbol-error rate of the proposed hybrid scheme is derived for varying spreading factor per symbol, considering both identically and nonidentically distributed channel statistics. While the information rate and average transmit power per bit are kept the same, it is shown that, with manageable receiver complexity, the hybrid scheme can be a good alternative to multidimensional MC or, even better, outperforming classical MC and VSF in view of the bit-error rate.	bit error rate;telecommunications link	Dong In Kim	2004	IEEE Trans.

The reason behind the election of this particular scenario is the recent interest on employing relay networks in wireless and mobile broadband systems to increase the coverage and throughput in a cost-effective way. Thus, the probability distribution of enhanced noise, made up by the sum of ratios of complex Gaussian random variables, is used to obtain a closed-form expression for the BER in the scenario under study.	multiplexing;relay;throughput;x.690	Juan Jesús Sánchez Sánchez;Unai Fernández-Plazaola;M.

This AS detector performs ring detection and phase detection separately, and leads to the circular decision boundaries in the middle of rings. We derive a unified, closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) of M-APSK with phase reference error (PRE) due to imperfect phase estimation, based on our previously proposed additive observation phase noise model. The SEP result is analytically tractable and consists of products of Gaussian Q-functions. An accurate, unified approximation to the error floor is directly obtained as a sum of Gaussian Q- functions. Within a wide range of PRE variances, our approximations agree very well with the Monte Carlo simulation for all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of interest. We show that as the PRE variance or the SNR or both increase, the AS detector outperforms the conventional minimum Euclidean distance detector. Moreover, our results provide explicit insight into how the parameters affect the error performance, and facilitate the optimization of M-APSK constellations in phase noise.

For the conventional detection scheme, which simply deals with the interference due to other users as noises, an approximate BER expression and a lower bound are derived in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Numerical results show that the approximate formula matches the simulated results and the lower bound serves as a very tight bound. Further, an enhanced multi-user detection algorithm based on successive interference cancellation with statistic ordering is proposed for the interleaved OFDM-based TDCS in the multipath fading channel. Its performance advantage over the single user detection is proved through simulations.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;branch and bound;cognitive radio;frequency divider;interference (communication);multi-user;multipath propagation;multiplexing;numerical method;simulation;transcranial direct-current stimulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Chuan Han;Jun Wang;Shaoqian Li	2007	2007 2nd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications	10.1109/CROWNCOM.2007.4549812	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;communication	Mobile	45.360168966479016	76.06537076879145	154239

We can combat a low SINR by using direct-sequence spread spectrum modulation with a sufficiently high processing gain, as well as by employing block codes for FEC on each packet. In this paper, we propose a packet detection and acquisition method for low SINR environments. The received waveform is processed using a non-linear filtering algorithm based on a maximum likelihood ratio calculation to detect the presence of transmitted packets. The algorithm uses the entire packet transmission for chip timing synchronization and code acquisition at the receiver. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed using simulations and real packet transmissions captured over the wireless medium. The algorithm is finally implemented on a FPGA which is a part of a wireless transceiver prototype. The experimental results are reported.	algorithm;code;computer simulation;data recovery;field-programmable gate array;forward error correction;interference (communication);modulation;network packet;nonlinear system;process gain;prototype;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transceiver;transponder timing;waveform	Manish Amde;Joel Marciano;Sushil K.

The system endeavors to provide a good trade-off between robustness, energy efficiency and high data rate, while still being simple compared to conventional multi-carrier spread spectrum systems. This system can be seen as a parallel extension of the DCSK modulation where one chaotic reference sequence is transmitted over a predefined subcarrier frequency. Multiple modulated data streams are transmitted over the remaining subcarriers. This transmitter structure increases the spectral efficiency of the conventional DCSK system and uses less energy. The receiver design makes this system easy to implement where no radio frequency (RF) delay circuit is needed to demodulate received data. Various system design parameters are discussed throughout the paper, including the number of subcarriers, the spreading factor, and the transmitted energy. Once the design is explained, the bit error rate performance of the MC-DCSK system is computed and compared to the conventional DCSK system under multipath Rayleigh fading and an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Simulation results confirm the advantages of this new hybrid design.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;bit error rate;coherence (physics);data rate units;distributed bragg reflector;download;key (cryptography);modulation;multi-user;multipath propagation;multiplexing;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;systems design;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Georges Kaddoum;Francois-Dominique Richardson;François Gagnon	2013	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2013.071013.130225	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;radio receiver;spread spectrum	Mobile	42.629578723210905	76.784196771777	154676

First, the AF relaying is classified into two cases - a variable gain and a fixed gain. For each case, the closed-form average BER is derived by using the moment-generating function (MGF) of the effective output SNR, which quantifies the SNR penalty due to the noisy channel estimate. Moreover, the asymptotic BER bound is also provided at a high SNR regime for the insight of our approach. In particular, the effect of the feedforward delay on informing the source-relay channel estimate as to the destination is presented in the variable-gain relay. Numerical investigation shows that the analytic result makes an exact match with the simulation, and the comparative superiority between the fixed- and variable-gain relay is discussed.	anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;channel state information;cooperative mimo;feedforward neural network;noisy-channel coding theorem;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;variable-gain amplifier;x.690	Seungyoup Han;Seongwoo Ahn;Eunsung Oh;Daesik Hong	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.2007644	generating function;electronic engineering;frame relay;bit error rate;telecommunications;gain;computer science;engineering;comparative research;control theory;mathematics;cooperative diversity;estimation theory;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;information technology;feed forward;maximal-ratio combining;moment-generating function;statistics	Mobile	41.442846920741964	74.8289790466055	155061

In this paper, we analyze bit-error rate (BER) of an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation over an inter-chip wireless radio channel. Specifically, a novel technique of dynamically shifting an integral window is proposed to reduce the effects of inter-symbol interference (ISI). BER expressions are analytically derived and verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, by including both thermal and switching noise as the dominant noise sources, it is found that a BER less than 10-6 is feasible for a link distance up to 252 mm at a data rate of up to 650 Mbps. Besides, the link margin analysis shows that a link margin of 28.22 dB could be obtained for the same distance and data rate.	bit error rate;data rate units;information sciences institute;interference (communication);key (cryptography);link distance;modulation;monte carlo method;simulation;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video;x.690	Zhiming Chen;Tung-Sang Ng;Ai Qun Hu;Yue-Ping Zhang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.070518	computer simulation;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;monte carlo method	Mobile	41.115906816733165	76.28028235802971	155069

Although a number of approximate expressions for the probability of error in OFDM systems with integer time offset can be found in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that provides exact expressions. In particular, we derive exact closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) and the symbol error rate (SER) of BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM modulation for transmission over both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. The effect of the fractional carrier frequency offset (CFO) is taken into consideration in the derivations. This makes the derived expressions more useful in evaluating the probability of error for OFDM systems with CFO only, especially in cases like 16-QAM modulation for transmission over Rayleigh fading channels where exact closed-form expressions are not available. For OFDM systems with a large number of subcarriers, an approximate method for evaluating the BER/SER is given. Finally, numerical results are included to demonstrate the exactness of the derived expressions and the accuracy of the approximate method.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;carrier frequency offset;modulation;newton's method;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;subcarrier;x.690	Ahmed M.

Based on the measured channel data at 6 GHz, log-distance (LGD) model and linear-distance (LID) model are used to predict the large scale information or path loss (PL) firstly, and both achieve a good prediction precision. Then water-filling algorithm with the predicted PL (WPP) is proposed in this paper for frequency selective fading channel. The proposed algorithm can lead to a 33% increase in average capacity compared with uniform power allocation (UPA) scheme, and outperform the selective transmission (ST) scheme, especially in high transmitted signal to noise ratio (SNR). Besides, the robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated, which depends on the difference of PLs among radio links.	channel state information;signal-to-noise ratio;water filling algorithm;web hosting service	Liang Xin;Jianhua Zhang;Xiaofan Li	2012	The 15th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications		telecommunications;log-distance path loss model;computer network	Mobile	41.37605296647818	80.20532504897452	155886

Static and Rayleigh fading channels are considered. For fading channels, flat and dispersive channels are assumed. First, bit error rate (BER) performances for each case are derived for a fixed value of timing jitter. Later, a uniform distribution of jitter is assumed to evaluate the performance of the system, and the theoretical results are verified by computer simulations. Finger estimation error is treated as timing jitter and an appropriate model is generated. Furthermore, a worst case distribution that provides an upper bound on the system performance is presented and compared with other distributions. Effects of timing jitter on systems employing different pulse shapes are analyzed to show the dependency of UWB performance on pulse shape. Although our analysis assumes uniform timing jitter, our framework can be used to evaluate the BER performance for any given probability distribution function of the jitter.	autocorrelation;best, worst and average case;bit error rate;code;computer simulation;d. e. shaw research;dispersive partial differential equation;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;modulation;performance;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;ultra-wideband;x.690	Ismail Güvenç;Hüseyin Arslan	2004	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2004.6596639	computer simulation;jitter;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;statistics	Embedded	40.675653197661056	76.30026296833876	156253

According to the derivation in this paper, as the number of cancellation stages increases, the performance of a RAKE receiver with a multistage IC (MIC) scheme is observed to approach the APL only when the number of active users does not exceed the maximum user capacity, however i t fails to approach that of a system with only a single user.

Here, the frequency diversity induced by delayed replicas can be exploited by a subsequent channel decoder. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated over frequency selective block Rayleigh fading channels.

With such low complexity increment, we show simulation and laboratory test results that the proposed LDM system has significant performance advantage (3-9 dB) over traditional TDM systems, and maintains its performance up to the velocity of 260 km/h in mobile reception.	atsc 3.0;atsc standards;advanced television systems committee;baseline (configuration management);computer simulation;fast fourier transform;multiplexing;simulation;terrestrial television;transmitter;velocity (software development)	Sung Ik Park;Jae-young Lee;Seho Myoung;Liang Zhang;Yiyan Wu;Jon Montalban;Sunhyoung Kwon;Bo-Mi Lim;Pablo Angueira;Heung Mook Kim;Namho Hur;Jeongchang Mook Kim	2016	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2015.2492459	chlorine;statistical time division multiplexing;electronic engineering;real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;broadcasting;time-division multiplexing;multiplexing	HPC	45.15835288157094	80.68342595030927	158229

Such a technique is indeed available at present, but it is strongly limited by the assumption that the data symbols are mutually independent. In this paper, this limitation is removed, and a fast procedure is given for computing H moments of correlated digital signals. The computations grow linearly with the number of interferers. The assumption made is that correlated symbols are produced by a general finite-state sequential machine. As illustrative examples, the fast procedure is applied to bipolar and Franaszek MS-43 codes.		Gianfranco Cariolaro;Silvano Pupolin	1975	IEEE Trans.

This paper adds a number of new results to this body of knowledge. We begin with a description of two published multipath fading models that were derived from the same collection of data, i.e., the threepath and polynomial models. We then derive outage probability characteristics for a digital radio link using M -level quadrature amplitude modulation, cosine rolloff spectral shaping, and some form of equalization. We obtain results for both models, several kinds of equalization, and various combinations of system parameters. We find that the theoretically optimal equalizer, which is nonlinear, is not measurably better in performance than the best of the linear equalizers, which is simpler. Also, the performance of a properly equalized receiver can be very accurately estimated by knowing just the probability distribution, over many fades, of the gain amplitude at a single frequency. Finally, we show the influences on performance of such parameters as cosine rolloff factor, symbol rate, and unfaded carrier-to-noise ratio.		Lawrence Wai-Choong Wong;Larry J.

A receiver, based on the multiple-input, multiple-output antenna diversity concept and the maximum-likelihood criterion, allows the transmission of MSK-type signals with very small channel spacings, greatly improving the bandwidth efficiency of these signals. The concept of antenna diversity is used to greatly reduce the effects of adjacent channel interference for channels with Rayleigh fading. The results show that it is possible to transmit bit-synchronized MSK-type signals with a very small normalized channel spacing (e.g., /spl Delta/fT/sub b/=/spl plusmn/0.4) between channels, under almost any power imbalance between signals, with very small degradation in performance.	ac (complexity);algorithm;channel spacing;coefficient;crosstalk;elegant degradation;interference (communication);journal of machine learning research;key (cryptography);modulation;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;spectral efficiency;x.690;zero suppression	David Gidony;Irving Kalet	2004	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2003.822744	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;diversity scheme;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	42.685932493026954	77.15348148208571	159237

In addition, we compare the outage probability for amplify-and-forward systems with that of the direct transmission mode. Both analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the direct mode can outperform the amplify-and-forward mode even under moderate levels of uncompensated I/Q imbalance. The cross-over I/Q imbalance levels are determined analytically to be inversely proportional to the cube of the signal constellation size. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity receiver-based digital baseband I/Q imbalance compensation scheme for the amplify-and-forward mode.

Rain-induced fading characteristics and the concept of route diversity are briefly introduced. A route diversity system can be regarded as a parallel MIMO channel. Basic characteristics of these channels including capacity for various cases are investigated. Optimal codes are determined for space-time convolutional coding.

In this technique, different representations of OFDM symbols are generated by rotating the original frame using different phase sequences. Then, the signal having the minimum PAPR is selected and transmitted. To compensate the effect of the phase rotation at the receiver side, it is necessary to transmit the index of the selected phase sequence as an explicit Side Information (SI). In this paper, we propose a novel robust blind SLM technique that avoids sending any explicit (SI), where the selected signal index (SI) is embedded in the transmitted data by using an adequate transformation such as the Hadamard one. Furthermore, in order to recover the used (SI) index, we propose an optimized scheme which exploits mainly the higher-order statistics moments and cumulants of the received signal. We show that our proposed method guarantees a reliable signal recovery at the receiver side and dramatically reduces the PAPR level at the transmitter side. Simulation results are given to support our claims.	detection theory;download;embedded system;hadamard transform;itil;performance;power architecture platform reference;simulation;spatial light modulator;transmitter	Mouna Sghaier;Fatma Abdelkefi;Mohamed Siala	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952160	telecommunications;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	46.41225260470194	80.9481750965147	159881

Two chip waveforms, raised cosine (RC) and an orthogonal wavelet, are compared numerically in terms of the Pe. The results represent that the wavelet based system significantly outperforms the RC based system in terms of the Pe•. On the other hand, the wavelets have greater bandwidths than the RC waveforms. Thus, two systems are also compared in terms of the capacity (the number of users per Hertz) for the same Pe level. The results for the capacity show that the wavelet based design has 3% and 41% more capacity than the RC based system for the medium and low rate users, respectively, while the RC based system provides 7% higher capacity than the wavelet based system for high data rate users. Since the average power of wavelets is zero, they can utilize a Single Side Band (SSB) transmission. With the SSB transmission, the wavelet based system has 86%, 106% and 182% more capacity for the high, medium and low data rate users, respectively.	data rate units;discrete cosine transform;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;orthogonal wavelet;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;single-sideband modulation;super smash bros.;uncompressed video	Ertan Öztürk	2006		10.1145/1143549.1143554	chip;wavelet;code division multiple access;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	45.71180151704941	81.19591368280135	160156

With linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation, the optimal pilots design is presented. We also derive an easy-computing closed-form lower bound of the channel capacity. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation between the data and pilots is investigated by numerical optimization. It is shown that more power should be devoted to the data in low SNR environments and to the pilots in high SNR environments.	channel capacity;channel state information;ergodicity;key (cryptography);mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;modulation;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio	Yifei Zhao;Ming Zhao;Jing Wang;Yong Ren	2005	VTC-2005-Fall. 2005 IEEE 62nd Vehicular Technology Conference, 2005.	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.10.2937	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;channel capacity;statistics	HPC	39.551097503260216	74.60222565987226	160396

Also, a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) is designed to support multiple input multiple output (MIMO). In this paper, we propose the DFT-based channel estimation scheme for the sidehaul system.

This is a recently introduced channel model that involves the product of N Nakagami-m-distributed random variables. Employing the moment generating function approach, the authors derive symbol error rate expressions for a single-relay system under instantaneous power scaling (IPS) and average power scaling (APS) factors at the relay node, that is, variable and fixed gains. The results achieved by the authors demonstrate that the achievable diversity order is a function of Nakagami fading parameter (m) and degree of cascading (N ). An identical diversity order is obtained under both scaling factors when the relay is close to the destination. When the relay is close to the source, IPS becomes advantageous over APS. Monte–Carlo simulations are further provided to confirm the analytical results.	channel (communications);image scaling;integrated circuit layout design protection;monte carlo method;performance evaluation;relay;simulation	Haci Ilhan;Ibrahim Altunbas;Murat Uysal	2011	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2009.0840	computer simulation;stochastic process;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Mobile	40.03701742441943	75.64093117568675	160880
c11e82d7e5448942ebcdc079ba44c109c5096dab	a low-complexity turbo mud for mu-mimo sc-fdma systems		In order to provide high-quality services, current communication systems require high data-transmission rate and good error performance. Single carrier-frequency division multiple access SC-FDMA has been adopted as the uplink transmission standard in fourth generation cellular network to enable the power efficiency transmission in mobile station. Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output MU-MIMO technologies are adopted in many standards to enhance the data rate and the link robustness. By combining MU-MIMO techniques with the SC-FDMA modulation scheme, MU-MIMO SC-FDMA systems can achieve high data rates over broadband wireless channels. For MU-MIMO SC-FDMA systems, possible detection techniques include zero-forcing detection, minimum mean squared error detection and maximum likelihood detection MLD. Among these schemes, MLD is optimal, but its complexity grows exponentially with the number of symbols detected. As a result, there are demands for near MLD schemes that provide similar performance with less complexity. In this paper, we consider the MU-MIMO SC-FDMA communication and propose a low-complexity and high-performance turbo receiver for the systems. Some simulation examples for uplink scenario are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

The capacity is defined here as the maximally achievable total throughput in the narrow-band and wide-band subsystems. User signal power in the overlay systems affects the performance of the systems. The signal power is characterized as the relative power level of wide-band and narrow-band users according to the spreading bandwidth, spectral overlay ratio, and the number of spreading codes assigned to a user in singleand multiple-cell environments. The capacities of the overlay systems are then analyzed. The results of the analysis show that the single-code technique yields better performance than does the multicode scheme in terms of the capacities of the overlay systems. Furthermore, the use of a multicode technique for wide-band subsystems and a single-code scheme for narrow-band subsystems is desirable for enhancing the performance of CDMA overlay systems.	code;throughput	Chang Soon Kang;Dan Keun Sung	2002	IEEE Trans.

The spectrally precoded OFDM signal provides very small power spectral sidelobes decaying asymptotically as f-2J-2 with J integer-valued design parameter, thereby suppressing sidelobe powers effectively and achieving higher spectral efficiency than nonprecoded rectangularly-pulsed OFDM which has power spectral sidelobes decaying asymptotically as f-2. The CE-OFDM signal exhibits a unity peak-to-average power ratio, and thus enables the efficient use of transmitter's power amplifier. In this paper, a specific CE-OFDM block signaling format is proposed to incorporate spectral precoding with an aim to suppressing sidelobe powers more effectively than conventional nonprecoded CE-OFDM. The general constraint on spectral precoding is developed to ensure that the power spectral sidelobes of the spectrally precoded CE-OFDM block signal with arbitrary data statistics decay asymptotically as f-2J-2. Some spectral codes previously found for spectrally precoded OFDM are shown to meet the constraint and thus suited for spectrally precoded CE-OFDM. Specifically, spectral performance is analyzed for the spectrally precoded CE-OFDM block signal with independent and identically distributed data to illustrate the prevailing spectral advantage. The corresponding receiver is also developed to demodulate the spectrally precoded CE-OFDM block signal over dispersive channels.	additive white gaussian noise;adobe framemaker;audio power amplifier;block size (cryptography);code;discrete fourier transform;dispersive partial differential equation;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;norm (social);power architecture platform reference;roll-off;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Char-Dir Chung	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080682	transmitter;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Networks	42.72433954276999	76.30176689182034	161254

An asymptotic maximum likelihood (AML) receiver is developed for differentially detecting diversity-encoded DAPSK symbol signals by operating on two consecutive received symbol blocks sequentially. Based on Beaulieu's convergent series, the bit error probability (BEP) upper bound is analyzed for the AML receiver over inid time-correlated Rician fading channels. Particularly, an approximate BEP upper bound of the AML receiver is also derived for inid time-invariant Rayleigh fading channels with large received signal-to-noise power ratios. By virtue of this approximate bound, a design criterion is developed to determine the appropriate diversity encoding coefficients for the proposed DAPSK MIMO system. Numerical and simulation results show that the AML receiver for diversity-encoded DAPSK is nearly optimum when the average received signal-to-noise power ratios are high and the channel is heavily correlated fading and can provide better error performance than conventional noncoherent MIMO systems when the effect of non-ideal transmit power amplification is taken into account.	modulation	Chi-Hua Huang;Char-Dir Chung	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-1799-7	telecommunications;rician fading;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	39.2588163028206	75.2465674867316	161312

The space-time-transmit-diversity (STTD) method is an open loop transmit diversity scheme, i.e. it does not require any knowledge of the channel at the transmitter. Simulations have shown that the STTD scheme significantly outperforms the case where no antenna diversity is used. In fact, it even outperforms the non-diversity (ND) case even when soft handoff is used. STTD exploits the extra path diversity afforded by the second antennas and therefore outperforms two other open loop transmit antenna diversity techniques, viz. the orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD) and the time switched time diversity (TSTD). These techniques use multiple transmit antennas to provide some interleaver time diversity against fading, particularly at low Doppler rates and when the mobile receiver does not have enough paths at the RAKE receiver. STTD has the added advantages of being a power amplifier (PA) balanced technique, is easily backward compatible with ND systems and does not need careful interleaver design.		Anand G.

These two receiver structures attempt to countermeasure the effects of the worst case multitone jamming (MTJ) and additive white Gaussian noise over Rayleigh- and Rician-fading channels, respectively. In addition, analytical bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the two proposed suboptimum structures are derived and validated by simulation results. Performance comparisons among various receivers show that the proposed suboptimum receivers significantly outperform the other existing receivers over fading channels. The optimum diversity level of the suboptimum ML receiver for the Rayleigh-fading case is found to be higher than that of the Rician-fading case. In addition, the proposed suboptimum ML receivers with optimum diversity levels can effectively remove the effect of MTJ, even under very low signal-to-jamming ratio conditions.	additive white gaussian noise;best, worst and average case;bit error rate;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;key (cryptography);numerical method;radio jamming;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Yang Han;Kah Chan Teh	2005	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2004.838895	additive white gaussian noise;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;spread spectrum;statistics	Mobile	41.98269915488922	75.50626228113059	162606

By applying the Gauss-Hermite quadrature integration, we derive an accurate closed-form approximation for the symbol pairwise error rate (SPER) and corresponding tight upper and lower bounds on the SER of STBCs from CIODs. An accurate closed-form approximate formula for the IOP is also derived by formulating the composite squared lognormal/chi-square probability density function and exploiting the high-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) approximation technique. Furthermore, we investigate the achievability of full diversity in Rayleigh fading channels with shadowing effects. Finally, various Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate our theoretical results.	approximation algorithm;code;gaussian quadrature;gauss–hermite quadrature;interoperability;monte carlo method;performance evaluation;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage	Chanho Yoon;Hoojin Lee;Joonhyuk Kang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2010.2103099	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	39.49654030403848	76.02910629071594	162857

In an OFDM, different channel delay profiles and path strengths bring different frequency selective patterns. Therefore, OFDM system can potentially provide a diversity at the frequency selective fading due to the different channel delay profiles. When we consider only the diagonal components of UMMwith splitting over the coherence bandwidth, the system can obtain a frequency diversity in a single antenna, since the channel response of the diagonal components of UMM that split over the coherence bandwidth shows to be totally different. In this paper, we propose the diagonal components of UMM/OFDM with splitting over the coherence bandwidth (UMM-S/OFDM) in a single antenna. The proposed system can obtain the frequency diversity with splitting the diagonal components of UMM/OFDM over the coherence bandwidth. Therefore, the proposed system with a single antenna can obtain good BER performance like the USTM/OFDM with two antennas.

In this paper, we make the first-ever attempt to tackle the blind low-density parity-check (LDPC) encoder identification for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signals. We propose a novel blind identification system which consists of three components, namely EM (expectation-maximization) estimator for signal amplitude and noise variance, LLR (log-likelihood ratio) estimator for syndrome a posteriori probabilities, and maximum average LLR detector.

Based on the maximum multi-path spreading delay, a minimum duration of “off” is suggested, during which the temporally adjacent bits (TABs) that contain multi-user interference (MUI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) from different users at the receiver are decoupled. The O3BPSK signaling scheme is combined with the whitening Rake receiver to preserve multi-path diversity gain in multi-path fading CDMA channels. The scheme offers low complexity, no detection delay, near–far resistance, and compensation for fading channels.	decorrelation;information sciences institute;interference (communication);key whitening;lego digital designer;magic user interface;multi-user;rake;rayleigh fading	Chia-Hsin Cheng;Jen-Yung Lin;Chao-Kai Wen;Jyh-Horng Wen	2009	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-008-9524-z	fading distribution;telecommunications;diversity scheme;fading;statistics;computer network;rake receiver	Mobile	44.54324777313167	78.29741331330297	163227

To further improve the uplink transmission performance, the transmit diversity technique can be used. Cyclic delay transmit diversity (CDTD) can strengthen the frequency-selectivity of the channel. In this paper, we apply CDTD to 2D block spread CDMA with MMSE-FDE. The achievable uplink BER performance is evaluated by computer simulation for both direct sequence CDMA and multi-carrier CDMA. It is shown that CDTD can offer improved uplink BER performance in a frequency-selective uplink channel.	adobe framemaker;computer simulation;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);multi-user;performance;powerflasher fdt;rayleigh fading;selectivity (electronic);telecommunications link;x.690	Qiyue Yu;Weixiao Meng;Bo Liu;Fumiyuki Adachi	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449845	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;fading;computer network	Arch	44.433395453842536	78.83512257518146	163370

According to the properties of GPZ-chip waveforms, the multiple access interference of different users can be reduced or eliminated. The interferences among different streams of the same user are handled by an optimal (or suboptimal) multi-stream detector(s). The performance of the proposed system is simulated and analyzed in a cellular communication environment consisting of multipath fading. The result shows that the proposed system has similar performance as compared to the single-rate QS-CDMA system employing GPZ codes with one chip waveform due to the properties of multi-stream detection. Also, the proposed system can achieve a significant interference reduction as compared to the multi-rate system employing concatenated WH/m sequence sets with one chip waveform due to the zero correlation zone properties of the GPZ-chip waveforms, thus resulting better BER performance.	modulation	Lifang Feng;Pingzhi Fan;Jonathan Loo;Li Hao	2010	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-009-9801-5	chip;multipath propagation;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	45.10566332336908	79.0917337576803	163409

In this scheme, only one-bit of feedback is used to determine the transmission phase terms applied to the symbols from the antennas of each relay nodes. This is considerably lower feedback overhead than previous feedback schemes. This feedback information is based upon channel state information (CSI) available at the destination node. In addition, the transmission rate over each hop in the network is unity and full cooperative diversity is obtained by the approach. Furthermore, this proposed scheme is applied to asynchronous relay networks using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with cyclic prefix (CP) at the source node to combat the timing error at relay nodes, which operate in a simple distributed STBC mode. End-to-end bit error rate (BER) simulation results show that the proposed scheme can enhance the performance of the system with feedback limited to only one-bit and outperform previous feedback methods.	bit error rate;block code;channel state information;circular shift;feedback;frequency divider;multiplexing;overhead (computing);relay;simulation;x.690	Abdulghani M.

This paper exploits the potential of large antenna arrays to develop a low-complexity directional modulation technique, Antenna Subset Modulation (ASM), for point-to-point secure wireless communication. The main idea in ASM is to modulate the radiation pattern at the symbol rate by driving only a subset of antennas in the array. This results in a directional radiation pattern that projects a sharply defined constellation in the desired direction and expanded further randomized constellation in other directions. Two techniques for implementing ASM are proposed. The first technique selects an antenna subset randomly for every symbol. While randomly switching antenna subsets does not affect the symbol modulation for a desired receiver along the main direction, it effectively randomizes the amplitude and phase of the received symbol for an eavesdropper along a sidelobe. Using a simplified statistical model, an expression for the average uncoded symbol error rate (SER) is derived as a function of the observation angle. To overcome the problem of large sidelobes in random antenna subset switching, the second technique uses an optimized antenna subset selection procedure based on simulated annealing to achieve superior performance compared with random selection. Numerical comparisons of the SER performance and secrecy capacity of the proposed techniques against those of conventional array transmission are presented to highlight the potential of ASM.	delta-sigma modulation;point-to-point (telecommunications);radiation pattern;randomized algorithm;randomness;simulated annealing;statistical model	Nachiappan Valliappan;Robert W.

The space-time system employs two transmit antennas and single receive antennas at the user side and base-station receiver, respectively. The receiver employs a decorrelator multiuser detector. In the analysis, we obtain a closed form expression for the bit error probability. It is shown that the performance of the space-time transmit diversity scheme, designed earlier for fast-fading channels, reduces to that of the existing schemes designed for slow-fading channels.

To fully capture signal energy spread over multiple paths, the desired user's channel parameters are necessary. In this paper, we first convert a time-hopping (TH) UWB signal model using pulse position modulation (PPM) to a linear form similar to that of a code division multiple access (CDMA) system. Then, we apply a power-of-R (POR) technique to blindly estimate multipath parameters of the desired user in a multiple-access (MA) UWB system, where """"R"""" represents the data covariance matrix. The POR technique is related to the subspace technique in that it directly estimates the unknown noise-subspace component in the subspace method but avoids rank estimation where errors may be incurred by perturbations in practical conditions. Performance of the proposed POR channel estimator is analyzed and shown to converge to that of the ideal subspace approach. Detection performance of the Rake receiver constructed from the estimated channel is also studied in terms of output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and bit error rate (BER). The proposed method demonstrates superiority to existing maximum-likelihood (ML)-based approaches in terms of either channel estimation or symbol detection.

This method reduces run-time computational demands and system complexity in comparison to our previously proposed dual-wavelength channel estimation technique. We consider propagation of optical wavelengths in fog, where the droplet diameters are close to the wavelength and thus scattering and absorption effects are significant. A method for rapid calculation of a channel response function based on estimating the effective optical depth of the channel and curve-fitting is described. The channel response estimate can then be used to design a receiver-side equalizer (minimum mean-squared error linear equalizer) to correct the signal distortion due to propagation through the dispersive channel. The channel estimates are based on parametric curve-fitting functions which have been developed using the modified-vector radiative transfer theory to model the channel response. The optimal fit parameters are found using particle-swarm optimization to minimize the simulated bit-error rate of the received signal.	bit error rate;channel state information;computation;curve fitting;dispersive partial differential equation;distortion;equalization (communications);erewhon;frequency response;interpolation;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;online and offline;particle swarm optimization;simulation;software propagation;terrestrial television;x.690	Colin Reinhardt;Yasuo Kuga;Sermsak Jaruwatanadilok;Akira Ishimaru	2009	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2009.091209	free-space optical communication;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Mobile	40.166684278388566	79.07618389920988	164569

We rely on the theory of H-function random variables to present an approach for the average BER evaluation of PC over partial-band jammed Rayleigh fading channels. The final closed-form formula is expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function, which can be easily evaluated using common mathematical software for small values of the diversity order. Based on this result we also develop an infinite series representation for the average BER. Numerical experiments show that the latter series representation offers a speed-up factor in evaluating the average BER especially for high values of the diversity order. The mathematical formalism is illustrated by some numerical examples showing the effect of various parameters on the performance of the system.	rayleigh fading;x.690	Gang Huo;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2001		10.1109/VTC.2001.957174	electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;series;statistics	Logic	40.07678942206607	75.52090708448272	164605

Extension is achieved by expressing the link outage probability in terms of the statistics of the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). This permits evidencing the role of the number of allocated subcarriers per slot on planning. The exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM) method is adopted. A closed-form expression for the link outage probability is achieved assuming a Gaussian approximation for the derivation of the statistics of the EESM-based SINR. This formula is then used to set up a simple planning procedure requiring the evaluation of only two averages of the SINR calculated on a generic subcarrier. The effectiveness of the proposed approximation with the number of allocated subcarriers per slot is investigated. An upper bound of the link outage probability in the presence of interference is provided. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is applied to the calculation of the network parameters for the typical two-cell interference scenario. It is shown that the considered approximation provides results with accuracy within 1 dB for a number of subcarriers greater than ten and for an outage performance target of 5%.	approximation;decibel;downtime;interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;sun outage;time complexity	Romeo Giuliano;Franco Mazzenga	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2021523	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;gaussian process;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	39.9467803642347	78.08863804807196	165860

The two main methods of spreading the spectrum have been to use either a direct sequence spreading or a frequency hopping spreading. The authors analyze an alternative multiple access scheme, multitune frequency hopping. The choice of frequencies is made randomly with the constraint that each frequency is not used more than once in each cell. With this random channel allocation one can avoid both frequency planning and intra-cell interference. Other advantages are frequency diversity, frequency interleaving and no problems regarding time dispersion. For a given minimum transmission quality constraint the authors define, a spectral efficiency measure. Further, they derive the spectral efficiency of the proposed system when a pilot tone MPSK modulation has been used. Even though they transmit a pilot tone for each used frequency, the resulting spectral efficiency of the proposed system compares favorably with other proposals for future mobile radio systems. >	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;spectral efficiency	Mikael Gudmundson	1994		10.1109/VETEC.1994.345376	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;spread spectrum;computer network	Robotics	41.74850929553378	80.16733783194854	166643

Despite standardization, important fundamental questions, especially relating to the performance due to the use of codebooks and receiver processing techniques, remain to be explored. In order to understand these questions, we consider a single user in a single cell employing single or multi-stream transmission using a variety of codebooks and a choice of different receiver types. We derive expressions for capacity loss relative to perfect feedback due to the limited size of codebook. When multistream transmission is deployed, we show that codebook feedback manifests itself as inter-stream interference resulting in a capacity loss for all receiver types. In the case of SVD receivers, this interference results in a capacity floor. We define a precoding matrix index (PMI) coherence time and bandwidth and show how these parameters are respectively related to channel coherence time and bandwidth. The PMI coherence parameters shed new light on how often feedback is required, both in time and frequency domains, and help us to determine the capacity penalty if feedback is delayed beyond the coherence parameters. Finally, we show the distribution of PMI and also show that this is environment dependent. This supports the need for codebooks that are adaptable to different environments and are not strictly tied to i.i.d. channels.	cache coherence;capacity loss;codebook;codec;compaq lte;feedback;interference (communication);irreducibility;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;simulation;singular value decomposition;with high probability	Min Zhang;Mansoor Shafi;Peter J.

In this paper, we revisit the equivalence and mathematically show that when the guard interval is insufficient, the well-known DFT-based processing inherently causes more intersymbol and interchannel interference (ISI/ICI) than the MF-based processing. Then, with the adverse increase of interference, analytical expressions for the link performance are derived in terms of bit error rate (BER).

Combined effect of multipath fading and shadowing along with multiple access interference (MAI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) worsens the system performance. Further, experimental results have confirmed the presence of impulsive noise in wireless mobile communication channels. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) based multiuser detection technique for DS-CDMA systems over generalized-K (GK) fading channels in presence of impulsive noise. Maximal ratio combining (MRC) receive diversity is also incorporated to mitigate the effects of fading and shadowing. Performance of proposed M-decorrelator is studied by evaluating average error rate. Simulation results show that the proposed M-decorrelator performs better in the presence of fading, shadowing and heavy-tailed impulsive noise when compared to least squares, Huber and Hampel M-estimator based detectors.	bit error rate;information sciences institute;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);least squares;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multi-user;multipath propagation;particle swarm optimization;sensor;simulation	Srinivasa Rao Vempati;Habibulla Khan;Anil Kumar Tipparti	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)	10.1109/ICICS.2015.7459947	fading distribution;detector;decorrelation;telecommunications;computer science;diversity scheme;shadow mapping;fading	EDA	44.982898777127566	77.63381954012333	167419

Increasing the number of relays will also boost the performance of the system, but since relays transmit through orthogonal channels, this improvement is at the cost of bandwidth or rate of the system. A two-hop multi-relay decode-and-forward cooperative system is proposed in which selected relays transmit simultaneously in the same band, and therefore, there is no rate or bandwidth loss. To mitigate the error propagation due to incorrect decoding of symbols at the relays, we use a selection relaying method in which a relay transmits in the second hop if the channel quality between the relay and the source exceeds a minimum threshold regardless of the relay-destination link. In our proposed beamforming scheme, the phase of selected relays for transmission in the second hop is adjusted to compensate for the channel between the relay and the destination and achieve the best performance at the destination using only a simple MRC receiver. The relays use only two-bit quantized phase information of the channel gain between the relay and the destination, which can be sent to the relays by the destination. The general family of M-QAM modulation constellations is considered in the performance and diversity analysis. It is proved that the scheme achieves full diversity order, and closed-form expressions for the thresholds that achieve full diversity are found.	beamforming;consensus dynamics;hop;modulation;multipath propagation;propagation of uncertainty;quantization (signal processing);relay;software propagation	Hesam Moharrer;Ali Olfat;Norman C.

In WCDMA system, orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard sequences are used as channelization codes. In frequency-selective fading channels the orthogonality of channelization codes disappears and intra-cell multiple access interference (MAI) arises. In order to mitigate the effect of MAI, a chip-level equalization has shown to be a simple and effective solution. The effectiveness of chip equalization, however, degrades at the cell borders where the inter-cell interference dominates rather than MAI. Dual antenna is a straight-forward solution to mitigate that performance drop. In this paper we consider receivers equipped with dual antenna and linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) chip-level equalizers and present an analysts of the expected gains over conventional single and dual antenna rake receivers in realistic situations by using a dynamic WCDMA system-level tool	channelization (telecommunications);code;fast walsh–hadamard transform;hadamard transform;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mean squared error;network performance;rake;signal-to-noise ratio	Timo Nihtilä;Janne Kurjenniemi;Marko Lampinen;Tapani Ristaniemi	2005	2005 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2005.1651640	telecommunications;computer science;w-cdma;computer network	Arch	42.55208044325519	79.87497747695095	167692

Its preceding complexity is much simpler as compared with that of the successive MMSE (SMMSE) technique (V. Stankovic and M. Haardt, 2004), without any performance loss. The new technique also takes both the high capacity benefit achievable with MIMO multiplexing and the benefit of space division multiple access (SDMA), assuming channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and receiver sides. In the new technique, the columns of the precoding matrix are obtained by computing successively reduced-rank MMSE precoding solutions on a per-user basis. Then, a per-user virtual channel which consists of the per-user channel through precoding is decomposed into orthogonal transmission modes. Finally, a proper power assignment can be applied to the decomposed modes according to some assignment policy. We compare the proposed technique with the SMMSE technique in terms of the bit error rate (BER) performance. We also analyze the computational complexity of the PU-SMMSE technique in comparison with the SMMSE and BD techniques. From computer simulations and complexity analyses, we see that the PU-SMMSE and SMMSE techniques have the same BER performance in both cases of dominant mode transmission (DMT) and multiple mode transmission (MMT). However, the computational complexity of the proposed technique is much lower than that of the SMMSE technique, and also is lower than that of the simple block diagonalization (BD) technique.	bit error rate;blu-ray;channel state information;column (database);computational complexity theory;computer simulation;digital monetary trust;gaussian elimination;ibm systems network architecture;mimo-ofdm;mpeg media transport;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;one-class classification;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter;virtual channel;x.690;zero-forcing precoding	Min Lee;Seong Keun Oh	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.490	computer simulation;minimum mean square error;transmitter;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	EDA	44.67663561527345	78.80171702640067	167724

Based on the minimum Euclidean distance between received vectors, we also present a simple antenna selection metric for the proposed spatial multiplexing systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our spatial multiplexing system performs close to the optimum closed loop system with much reduced complexity and feedback overhead.	decoding methods;euclidean distance;mimo;overhead (computing);simulation;spatial multiplexing	Heunchul Lee;Seokhwan Park;Inkyu Lee	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.65	statistical time division multiplexing;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;euclidean distance;control theory;mathematics;computer performance;value system;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing	Mobile	42.969763343017554	76.95531480384874	167848

EMP-induced interference (conducted EMP) at the receiver is modeled by a damped sinusoid and the analysis of the system uses a frequency domain approach instead of the conventional time domain approach. However, the interference suppression factor derived using the frequency domain approach reduces to that obtained using a time domain approach for the tone jammer case, in which the damping factor in the conducted EMP interference model approaches unity. Using a Gaussian approximation to the interference, numerical results are presented to illustrate the significant EMP-induced interference effects on the system performance and its hardening design parameters.

Space-time block coding (STBC) and vertical Bell Labs layered space time (V-BLAST) systems are capable of meeting these requirements by using multiple antenna strategies, respectively. However, in order to achieve largely improved performance they need precise channel information at the receiver, which is difficult to be guaranteed in some specific scenarios. In this paper, independent component analysis (ICA) technique is exploited to detect the transmitted signals blindly, which needs not the channel estimation. By analyzing the essential structures of STBC and V-BLAST systems, the specific models suitable to ICA are established. The robustness against channel estimation error and flexibility of system design can be acquired by using the ICA based scheme.

The model combines improved sum-of-sinusoids simulation models proposed for Rayleigh fading channels, and the two-dimensional (2-D) models proposed for MIMO systems, in a 3-D scattering environment. The distribution of 3-D scattering is assumed to be uniform in horizontal plane and Gaussian in the elevated plane. Simulation results showed that the new model satisfies the desired statistics with less Doppler spread, and hence can be used to generate independent fading channels for MIMO systems. The generated channels can be further processed to obtain correlated MIMO channels through the exploitation of correlation matrices at the transmit and receive sides. The resultant channel can then he used to simulate MIMO systems for a better system performance prediction.	autocorrelation;channel (communications);mimo;performance prediction;rayleigh fading;resultant;simulation;software propagation;transmitter	Mehmet Kemal Özdemir;Hüseyin Arslan;Ercument Arvas	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

Expressions for the average BER due to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), random FM noise and delay-spread in the multipath channel are derived for reception using differential demodulation (DD), and frequency demodulation (FD) assuming independent fading signals. Calculated results for MSK show that the BER performance is strongly dependent on the RMS-delay/bit-duration ratio and that the delay-spectrum shape is of no importance when the receiver predetection filter product is optimized for the effect of AWGN. The effect of fading correlation on the diversity improvement is also analyzed for a two-branch case with multiplicative Rayleigh fading signals. Expressions for the average BER due to AWGN and random FM noise are derived. Calculated results are shown for the average BER due to random FM noise assuming a horizontally spaced antenna system at a mobile station. It is shown that the use of small antenna spacings leads to a diversity improvement greater than that obtainable for the case of independent AWGN. >	fm broadcasting	Fumiyuki Adachi;John David Parsons	1989	IEEE Trans.

First, we derive an exact expression for the moment generation function (MGF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a code symbol at the output of the selection combiner. Next, based on Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature and Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rules, we propose a simple to compute, yet accurate, numerical solution for the pairwise error probability (PEP) of coded M-phase-shift keying (PSK) signals. Using the PEP expressions, we present the union bound-based bit-error performance of trellis-coded modulation schemes and turbo codes. Finally, we derive an exact expression for the computational cutoff rate of a coded system with M-PSK signaling and SC diversity, and show that the cutoff rate expression is a simple function of the MGF of the SNR at the output of the diversity combiner.	chebyshev–gauss quadrature;coherence (physics);gauss–laguerre quadrature;key (cryptography);modulation;numerical integration;numerical partial differential equations;pairwise error probability;power dividers and directional couplers;pre-shared key;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;trellis quantization;turbo code	Ramesh Annavajjala;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam;Laurence B.

We prove that the power of the complex received signal is a sufficient statistic and derive the probability density function of the received signal amplitude for all of these fading cases. Simulation results reveal that the sensing performance degrades with the severity of the fading as well as the level of temporal correlation. We also consider mis-matched channel conditions and show that the average detection delay depends greatly on the channel but very little on the nature of the detector.	cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;one-class classification;portable document format;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time-invariant system	Effariza Hanafi;Philippa A.

We analyze the performance of ESM in 2×4 and 4×4 MIMO systems under imperfect channel information for uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh and Rician fading. The performance of ESM is compared to Spatial Modulation (SM) and Multiple Active-Spatial Modulation (MA-SM) systems. We find ESM to be marginally superior to SM in most cases while performing worse than MA-SM in cases other than Rayleigh fading. Additionally, ESM exhibits improved tolerance to channel information errors.	camera serial interface;mimo;modulation;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;spatial anti-aliasing;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;throughput	Michael Carosino;James A.

Multiantenna technologies called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are an obvious candidate to increase, particularly, downlink capacity. Nearly all research on MIMO-CDMA, however, has focused on increasing the throughput achieved per user, rather than increasing the number of supportable users, which is still the most important design goal in QoS-constrained voice systems. In this paper, we consider the downlink of a heavily loaded multicell CDMA system with multiple transmit and receive antennas. Straightforward application of the known MIMO techniques to such a system does not substantially increase the number of supportable users. To overcome this, a novel MIMO-CDMA system design based on user partitioning is developed, in which each user is assigned to a single transmit antenna either without regard to channel knowledge (static) or based on antenna-selection feedback bits (dynamic). These proposed multiuser-antenna-partitioning techniques have a minimal increase in complexity and would require only small changes to existing CDMA standards. The outage probability and capacity of the proposed systems are derived, and it is shown that, particularly, the dynamic partitioning scheme has a large gain over both the conventional CDMA and the static MIMO-CDMA scheme. This gain can be credited to multiuser antenna selection diversity. Unlike prior research, the multiuser antenna selection diversity gain is achieved without the typical expense of a loss in spatial multiplexing gain.Improving the capacity of code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) systems through advanced signal processing has been an area of intensive research for many years, with limited success.

ICI self-cancellation schemes based on polynomial cancellation coding (PCC-OFDM) can evidently reduce the sensitivity to CFO. In this paper, we analyze the performance of PCC-OFDM systems impaired by CFO over additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Two criteria are used to evaluate the effect of CFO on performance degradations. Firstly, the closed-form expressions of the average carrier-to-interference power ratio (CIR) and the statistical average ICI power, both of which reflect the desired power loss, are presented. Simulation and analytical results show that the theoretical expressions depend crucially on the normalized frequency offset and are hardly relevant to the number of subcarriers. Secondly, by exploiting the properties of the Beaulieu series, the effect of CFO on symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER) performance for PCC-OFDM systems are exactly expressed as the sum of an infinite series in terms of the characteristic function (CHF) of ICI. We consider the systems modulated with binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature PSK (QPSK), 8-ary PSK (8-PSK), and 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM), and all above modulation schemes are mapped with Gray codes for the evaluations of BER.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;carrier frequency offset;characteristic function (convex analysis);code;committed information rate;cryptographic hash function;frequency divider;gaussian quadrature;ici (programming language);interference (communication);key (cryptography);mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;normalized frequency (fiber optics);performance evaluation;polynomial;portable c compiler;pre-shared key;simulation;subcarrier;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise;x.690	Peng Zhou;Chunming Zhao;Zhihua Shi;Xiaoqun Gong	2008	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-008-0016-2	bit error rate;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	43.132668111842904	77.95735861964987	170494

Firstly, the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of output signal to interference plus noise ratios (SINR) with zero forcing frequency domain equalization (ZF-FDE) and minimum mean squared error frequency domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) are derived by employing the numerical inversion of Laplace transforms. Next, based on the CDFs of the output SINRs, the approximate average bit error rate expressions as functions of the average receive signal to noise ratio for Gray-coded quaternary phase shift keying constellations are obtained. Finally, analytical and Monte Carlo simulated results are compared, and they perfectly agree for both ZF-FDE and MMSE-FDE.	adobe framemaker;approximation algorithm;bit error rate;carrier frequency;frequency divider;interference (communication);key (cryptography);mean squared error;modulation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Haiming Wang;Xiaohu You;Bin Jiang;Xiqi Gao	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.815	gray code;telecommunications;mathematics;laplace transform;statistics;monte carlo method	EDA	40.6728500750843	76.7215868018137	170515

Two different transmission schemes, namely sensing-based spectrum sharing (SSS) and opportunistic spectrum access (OSA), are considered. In both schemes, secondary users first perform channel sensing, albeit with possible errors. In SSS, depending on the sensing decisions, they adapt the transmission power level and coexist with primary users in the channel. On the other hand, in OSA, secondary users are allowed to transmit only when the primary user activity is not detected. Initially, for both transmission schemes, general formulations for the optimal decision rule and error probabilities are provided for arbitrary modulation schemes under the assumptions that the receiver is equipped with the sensing decision and perfect knowledge of the channel fading, and the primary user's received faded signals at the secondary receiver has a Gaussian mixture distribution. Subsequently, the general approach is specialized to rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). More specifically, the optimal decision rule is characterized for rectangular QAM, and closed-form expressions for the average symbol error probability attained with the optimal detector are derived under both transmit power and interference constraints. The effects of imperfect channel sensing decisions, interference from the primary user and its Gaussian mixture model, and the transmit power and interference constraints on the error rate performance of cognitive transmissions are analyzed.	coexist (image);cognitive radio;interference (communication);mixture model;modulation	Gozde Ozcan;Mustafa Cenk Gursoy;Sinan Gezici	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692196	qam;carrierless amplitude phase modulation;cognitive radio;pulse-amplitude modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;computer science;probability;channel state information;fading;quadrature modulation	Mobile	39.50881790279988	80.2603307022585	171201

In addition, the number of users increases with the same speed. Focusing on the practical impairments of the channel such as pilot contamination and, in particular, delayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), we derive an approximation of the sum rate with regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding, which provides a quantification of the capacity loss. As a result, it is deemed necessary to obtain the deterministic equivalent sum rate by incorporating in our analysis channel prediction circumventing the degradation due to delayed CSIT. The proposed results are accurate for realistic system dimensions, as simulations testify. Finally, we show the benefits of applying RZF in the sum rate against using eigenbeamforming (BF) for the same Doppler shift with no extra computational complexity.	approximation;brainfuck;capacity loss;channel state information;computable function;computational complexity theory;doppler effect;duplex (telecommunications);elegant degradation;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;numerical analysis;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Anastasios K.

In this scheme, two transmit antennas, which maximize the total received signal power, are selected to transmit the full-rank baseline STTCs designed for two transmit antennas. An upper bound on the pairwise error probability (PEP) of this scheme is derived in quasistatic flat Rayleigh fading channels. It is shown that, as long as the baseline STTC has a full rank, a full diversity order can be achieved, as if all the transmit antennas were used. This scheme has a fixed low decoding complexity as for the baseline STTC and a full diversity order can be achieved with a small memory order. Therefore, the TAS/STTC scheme provides a new approach to the design of MIMO system achieving a high diversity order based on the existing STTCs designed for a small number of transmit antennas.	baseline (configuration management);channel state information;convolutional code;mimo;pairwise error probability;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;simulation;systems design;telecommunications link;thermal-assisted switching;trellis quantization	Zhuo Chen;Branka Vucetic;Zhendong Zhou	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

20e55a79ec03f23206a7613fbaaadc0e9939643b	vector ofdm with index modulation		The concept of index modulation (IM) has gained increased attention in recent years. As a member of the IM family, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM), which is able to convey additional information bits using the indices of the active subcarriers, has emerged as an attractive physical layer transmission technique. Vector OFDM (V-OFDM) has inherently good peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) feature and good bit error rate (BER) performance due to the nearly full diversity gains achieved by most of its sub-blocks. In this paper, in order to improve the BER performance of OFDM-IM and reduce the PAPR of the transmit signal, we propose an enhanced OFDM-IM scheme termed vector OFDM with index modulation (V-OFDM-IM). In addition to the structure of the transceiver, a complexity reduced maximum likelihood detector is presented. To further reduce the detection complexity, a near-optimal detector based on sequential Monte Carlo technique is introduced. The average bit error probability of the proposed scheme is derived in closed form over frequency-selective block Rayleigh-fading channel. Both the theoretical and the simulation-based results show that, under the same spectrum efficiency, V-OFDM-IM outperforms the conventional OFDM-IM and OFDM.	bit error rate;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;modulation;monte carlo method;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;transceiver;x.690	Yun Liu;Fei Ji;Miaowen Wen;Dehuan Wan;Beixiong Zheng	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756080	bit error rate;modulation;physical layer;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;particle filter;mathematics;detector;spectral efficiency;control theory;communication channel	Mobile	44.54004327556134	79.89445091538212	172184

The average SINR of the statistical beamforming depends on the accuracy of transmit correlation information as well as the characteristics of co-channel interference (CCI) from adjacent base stations. It is shown by means of multivariate Taylor series expansion that the average SINR degradation due to imperfect transmit correlation is associated with the mean squared error (MSE) and the number of quantization bits, and that those effect significantly varies depending on the correlation magnitude and the phase difference between the transmit correlation coefficient of the intended and CCI channel.	beamforming;channel state information;coefficient;elegant degradation;interference (communication);mean squared error;multi-user;quantization (signal processing);series expansion;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Hee-Nam Cho;Han-Jun Park;Yong-Hwan Lee	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.100142	telecommunications;taylor series;antenna;mathematics;mean squared error;accuracy and precision;statistics	Mobile	40.33674950104107	77.2716472059929	172495

Due to the drawback that traditional SCMA can't serve users with different business needs in the same scenario, we propose an irregular Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) in this paper. In contrast with the traditional SCMA system based on the regular structure, the irregular SCMA can handle massive connections and short time delay in the same system simultaneously by assigning different codebooks with various dimensions for different users who demand for divers performance needs. Simulation results illustrate that irregular SCMA can achieve about 0.7 dB gain over regular SCMA in terms of the same bit error rate (BER) condition.	bit error rate;broadcast delay;business requirements;codebook;degree distribution;effective method;fifth generation computer;neural coding;requirement;simulation;sparse matrix;x.690	Shutian Zhang;Baicen Xiao;Kexin Xiao;Zhiyong Chen;Bin Xia	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341327	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	HPC	44.269829154781604	81.2693164454494	172563
05fbf3a0a353fa7456336b6740523eab14bcc341	constellation design for multi-color visible light communications		In this paper, we propose a novel high dimensional constellation design scheme for visible light communication (VLC) systems employing red/green/blue light emitting diodes (RGB LEDs). It is in fact a generalized color shift keying (CSK) scheme which does not suffer efficiency loss due to a constrained sum intensity for all constellation symbols. Crucial lighting requirements are included as optimization constraints. To control non-linear distortion, the optical peak-to-averagepower ratio (PAPR) of LEDs is individually constrained. Fixing the average optical power, our scheme is able to achieve much lower bit-error rate (BER) than conventional schems especially when illumination color is more “unbalanced”. When cross-talks exist among the multiple optical channels, we apply a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based pre-equalizer and redesign the constellations, and such scheme is shown to outperform postequalized schemes based on zero-forcing or linear minimummean-squared-error (LMMSE) principles. To further reduce system BER, a binary switching algorithm (BSA) is employed the first time for labeling high dimensional constellation. We thus obtains the optimal bits-to-symbols mapping.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);bit error rate;diode;distortion;equalization (communications);key (cryptography);mathematical optimization;modulation;nonlinear system;power architecture platform reference;requirement;simulation;singular value decomposition;unbalanced circuit;vlc media player;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Qian Gao;Chen Gong;Rui Wang;Zhengyuan Xu;Yingbo Hua	2014	CoRR		telecommunications;mathematics	EDA	44.653134732378575	79.89667522944805	172569

Since the UWB signals have wide bandwidth, two problems arise, namely the high speed analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) required at the receiver side and the coexistence with other narrowband interference (NBI) systems that share the same part of the spectrum. The two problems can be addressed using compressive sensing (CS) based on the fact that narrowband signals have sparse representation in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. It becomes more complicated when multiuser case is considered. For training based NBI mitigation with CS, three groups of pilot symbols are used to estimate the NBI signal subspace, the UWB signal subspace and to provide information about the channel. This work aims to evaluate the system performance in the presence of multiuser interference in addition to the NBI. The paper extends the derivations to include the effect of the multiuser interference together with the NBI and the additive white Gaussian noise. Direct sequence combined with time hopping coding is applied for the multiple access technique. Simulation illustrates that as more users being active the performance of the system degrades. Additionally, when the number of the secondary users increases, the multiuser becomes the most dominant factor that affects the system performance irrespective of the NBI.	additive white gaussian noise;analog-to-digital converter;catastrophic interference;coexist (image);compressed sensing;ddos mitigation;data rate units;discrete cosine transform;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);multi-user;regular expression;signal subspace;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;ultra-wideband;utility functions on indivisible goods	Saleh A.

It is hard for the receiver to compensate multiple CFOs from multiple relay nodes simultaneously. Thus, the conventional space-time codes to collect cooperative diversity for co-located multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems may not be applied directly. In this paper, we consider the cooperative transmission with multiple CFOs when the channels from relay nodes to destination node are flat fading. We approximate a flat fading channel with CFO as a block time-invariant intersymbol-interference (ISI) channel in the frequency domain. We then propose a distributed space- frequency code (SFC), called frequency-reversal SFC, for such ISI channels in the frequency domain to achieve the cooperative spatial diversity, where the space-frequency coding concept is different from the one in the literature and also has a different role. Furthermore, we show that, with only linear receivers, such as zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers, our code achieves the full cooperative diversity.	approximation algorithm;carrier frequency;catastrophic interference;code;information sciences institute;interference (communication);mimo;mean squared error;relay;space-filling curve;system analysis;time-invariant system;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Huiming Wang;Xiang-Gen Xia;Qinye Yin	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.741	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;cooperative diversity;frequency domain;fading	Mobile	43.569945443588956	77.03056813519505	173381

Two schemes employing two different index selectors and detectors to implement IM and demodulation are introduced. The new designed index selectors are one-to-one mappings between the index symbols and the carrier activation patterns, which can avoid the disaster caused by the previous designed selectors. Analytical bit error rate expressions of the two systems are derived over the additive white Gaussian noise as well as multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results verify the superiority of one scheme in energy efficiency and another scheme in spectral efficiency, respectively, compared with MC-DCSK.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;data rate units;delta-sigma modulation;key (cryptography);multipath propagation;one-to-one (data model);rayleigh fading;sensor;simulation;spectral efficiency;transceiver;travis ci;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Guixian Cheng;Lin Wang;Weikai Xu;Guanrong Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2016.2613093	delta modulation;electronic engineering;pulse-amplitude modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;pulse-position modulation;quadrature modulation	Mobile	43.35596800540607	79.60277569714866	173649

The increase in OOBE due to a nonlinear PA has been well-observed, but its characterization involves complicated analysis. In this paper, we present a closed-form approximation to the power spectral density (PSD) of a signal at the output of a nonlinear PA, or more specifically, the solid-state power amplifier (SSPA). The SSPA's response can be approximated using a third order nonlinear model (TONM) which has been proposed in literature. Using the TONM, we proposed a statistical approximation, together with a piecewise linear model, to determine a closed-form estimate to the OOBE of the PA output signal. Simulation results show a close fit between the theoretical expression for the derived PSD and the simulated model. Since the nonlinear PA increases the OOBE due to spectral regrowth, the ability to characterize this behavior is of particular importance to the application of TV band devices (in television broadcast frequency bands) that need to fulfill certain OOBE limits.	approximation algorithm;audio power amplifier;baseband;convolution;frequency band;linear model;nonlinear system;object-oriented business engineering;out-of-bag error;out-of-band agreement;piecewise linear continuation;simulation;solid-state drive;spectral density;tv tuner card;transmitter	Meng Wah Chia;Yonghong Zeng;Ying-Chang Liang	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555222	linear amplifier;mathematical optimization;transmitter;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;transmitter power output;rf power amplifier;computer network;approximation theory	EDA	42.09817573008647	77.65044078375257	173658

While most of the energy detection techniques deal with the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, few algorithms have been implemented to recognize vacant spectrum over frequency selective fading channels where the primary and secondary users are not mutually synchronized at the bit level. For that environment, we devise a novel technique that can efficiently detect the presence of a primary user with the help of its known symbols. Sliding window technique is used to combat the effect of interference in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment over the fading channels with different number of channel taps. Simulation results are performed to support the analysis.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;asynchronous i/o;bit-level parallelism;frequency allocation;interference (communication);numerical analysis;selectivity (electronic);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Md Rakibul Hasan;Mohammad Saquib	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364275	fading distribution;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	45.33380493073191	76.53831969943188	173910

The effects of receiver oversampling, Doppler spread and fading power delay profile are quantified in the error probability expressions. Simulation results show that the new analytical results can accurately predict the error performances of MLSE and MAP equalizers in a wide range of SNR. Moreover, it is discovered that significant performance gain can be achieved by fractionally spaced receivers over symbol spaced receivers for systems experiencing fast time-varying fading, whereas the effects of Doppler spread are overlooked by most previous works.	domain analysis;doppler effect;matched filter;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;modulation;oversampling;performance;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;trellis quantization	Jingxian Wu;Chengshan Xiao	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

The resulting increase in channel dispersion can have a detrimental impact on code-timing acquisition. Two maximum likelihood code-timing acquisition algorithms are proposed for multipath channels: a multiuser estimator and a single-user estimator. Multipath diversity is exploited in the estimators via maximum ratio combining to increase the signal-to-interference ratio. In addition, correlations between signals from different paths are explicitly incorporated in the test statistics of both estimators. The Cramer-Rao bounds are found and the performances of the estimators are examined via simulations. The results indicate that the estimators are robust to near-far power ratio and channel dispersion. Moreover, the gain achieved by incorporating channel dispersion in estimator design is significant.	telecommunications link	Feng Lu;Yongbin Wei;James V. Krogmeier;Saul B.

Alternatively, switched-transmitter diversity (STD) systems are less difficult to implement, but their performance is suboptimal when compared to MRT systems. If the difference is not significant, implementation advantages of STD systems outweigh the minor performance loss so that these systems are desirable for practical implementations. This paper compares the performances between MRT and STD systems under Rayleigh-fading conditions for 2 x 1, 2 x 2 and 4 x (transmit antennas x receive antennas) configurations. It is found that the differences are only about 1dB for the 2 x l and 2 x 2 configurations, indicating that implementation simplicity of a STD system can be utilized without sacrificing too much performance. However, the difference is around 3dB for the 4 x configuration. The considerably larger loss prompts system designers to consider more critically on the tradeoffs between implementation aspects and performances of STD and MRT systems.	performance;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;std bus;transmitter	Ching-Hok Tse;Kun-Wah Yip;Tung-Sang Ng	2000		10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881665	filter;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;rayleigh fading;radio;antenna;matched filter;signal-to-noise ratio;transmit diversity;systems design	OS	42.59495270251126	75.71716016946782	175854

Least square (LS), scaled least square (SLS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) methods are considered for estimating channel properties of a MIMO system using training sequences. The undertaken mathematical analysis reveals that the accuracy of the scaled least square (SLS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation methods are determined by the sum of eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrix. It is shown that for a fixed transmitted power to noise ratio (TPNR) assumed in the training mode, a higher spatial correlation has a positive effect on the performance of SLS and MMSE estimation methods. The effect of accuracy of the estimated Channel State Information (CSI) on MIMO system capacity is illustrated by computer simulations for an uplink case in which only the mobile station (MS) transmitter is surrounded by scattering objects.	channel capacity;channel state information;computer simulation;mimo;mean squared error;runge–kutta methods;structured-light 3d scanner;telecommunications link;transmitter	Xia Liu;Marek E.

The downlink MU-MIMO system is constructed as a transmitter with 6 antennas and receivers with 2 antennas, and the maximum number of users(receivers) is 3. In computer simulation, MU-MIMO transmission system can be realized by using the BD (Block Diagonalization) algorithm, and each user can receive signals without any signal interferences between the other users. BER (Bit Error Rate) performance and channel capacity according to modulation schemes and the number of streams are simulated in spatially uncorrelated and correlated multipath fading environment. In field experiment, downlink throughput on UDP layer are measured on the mobile WiMAX system with Matrix A mode and Matrix B mode developed at Azumino City in Japan. Compared with the simulated and experimented results, the measured maximum throughput performance in downlink has almost the same performance with the simulated throughput. It is confirmed that the experimental mobile WiMAX system for MU-MIMO transmission is actually performed for increasing the total channel capacity of the system.	algorithm;bit error rate;blu-ray;channel capacity;computer simulation;data rate units;experiment;futures and promises;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;maximum throughput scheduling;modulation;multi-user mimo;multipath propagation;pdf/a;performance evaluation;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Kazuhiro Yamaguchi;Takaharu Nagahashi;Takuya Akiyama;Takahiro Yamaguchi;Hideaki Matsue;Akio Hasui;Takakazu Namera;Hiroshi Fukui;Satoshi Nanamatsu	2014	2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983129	electronic engineering;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer network;mimo	Mobile	41.81919068902774	81.0437581735167	176766
55347499de8630248b8940d250b931f4b55d3d55	effect of spatial multiplexing on the performance of mpa detection in downlink scma		Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) draws great attention as a multiple access scheme for future wireless communications systems. In SCMA systems, a message passing algorithm (MPA) is employed as a multi-user detection scheme. However, high computational complexity of MPA is problem, especially in a downlink environment. Furthermore, the detection performance is degraded if the number of superposed symbols is increased. To improve the detection performance and reduce the computational complexity, this paper proposes a spatial multiplexing (SM) transmission scheme for downlink SCMA systems. Simulation results show that the packet error rate (PER) performance of the proposed SM-SCMA system is about 2.0 dB better than that of the single-input single-output (SISO) SCMA system. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed detection is reduced to about seven percent of that of MPA detection.	algorithm;bit error rate;code rate;code word;computation;computational complexity theory;factor graph;forward error correction;mimo;message passing;multi-user;network packet;neural coding;quantum superposition;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;sparse;spatial multiplexing;telecommunications link	Shintaro Ebi;Takahiko Saba	2016	2016 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)	10.1109/ICSPCS.2016.7843364	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	HPC	45.828845362299376	78.95252597813675	176772

Results of the analysis show that a higher carrier frequency reduces the propagation loss as well as the size of the transmitter and receiver, particularly for OAM channels with higher OAM values. Further, two different OAM channels (with l = +1 and l = +3) on each of the two polarizations are spatially multiplexed, and each channel carries 2-Gbaud signals with 16-QAM modulation. Spiral phase plates are used to generate 60-GHz OAM beams. The simulation results show that a higher carrier frequency plays a more significant role in reducing both the aperture size and the transmission loss for channels with higher OAM values. The bit error rates (BERs) of 4 channels are measured, and the raw BERs are found to be less than 3.8 × 10-3.	angular momentum operator;angularjs;bit error rate;carrier frequency;like button;linear polarization;modulation;molecular orbital;multiplexing;object access method;simulation;software propagation;transmitter	Yan Yan;Long Li;Zhe Zhao;Guodong Xie;Zhe Wang;Yongxiong Ren;Nisar Ahmed;Soji Sajuyigbe;Shilpa Talwar;Moshe Tur;Nima Ashrafi;Solyman Ashrafi;Andreas F.

Several receivers are developed for data detection, where the receivers have partial state information about the MU-MIMO transmission; however, the modulation constellation of the co-scheduled users is unknown. We propose a joint data detection and maximum likelihood (ML) modulation classification (MC) of the co-scheduled user. We show that the decision metric for MC is an accumulation of the Euclidean distances used by the ML single-user MIMO detector. An efficient hardware architecture emerges that exploits this commonality between the classification and detection steps and results in sharing of hardware resources.	computation;emergence;euclidean distance;exploit (computer security);frequency divider;hardware architect;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;tree accumulation	Ahmad Gomaa;Louay M.

The power spectral density characteristics of both OMO/sup 2/AM and OMO/sup 2/PM signals constructed from typical band-limited and time-limited basis signal sets are studied in terms of fractional power containments. Based on the maximum-likelihood principle, the optimum schemes for coherently demodulating uncoded OMO/sup 2/AM and OMO/sup 2/PM signals on the additive white Gaussian noise channel are developed. Union bounds and approximate upper bounds are analyzed and verified by simulation to evaluate the bit error probability characteristics of the optimum schemes. From numerical results, the OMO/sup 2/AM and OMO/sup 2/PM schemes are found to provide other good choices of power and spectral efficiencies ranging among the efficiencies achieved by the OMOAM and OMOPM families. When constructed from the practically realizable basis set with rectangularly pulsed quadrature carrier signals, improvement over certain orthogonally frequency-division-multiplexing modulation schemes in both power and spectral efficiencies is also achieved by some OMO/sup 2/AM and OMO/sup 2/AM schemes.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;basis set (chemistry);bit error rate;cell signaling;modulation;multiplexing;numerical analysis;on-off keying;oracle media objects (omo);simulation;spectral density;spectral efficiency;utility functions on indivisible goods	Char-Dir Chung;Horng-Shyang Liaw	2005	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2004.840195	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	42.09819565217741	76.06183026549667	177117

We hold the complexity by a tree pruning mechanism which obtains detection radius through the close-form expression for the SD expected complexity R.Gowaikar and B.Hassibi, 2007. And the Increasing Radii Algorithm (IRA) mechanism is used in the method to reduce the SER at the stable expected complexity.

The proposed method benefits from both the available training symbols inserted in the data frame structure of wireless standards as LTE and WiMAX and the redundancy introduced in the space-time code to enhance channel estimation quality. Our method offers a closed-form solution and performs channel estimation in the time domain in two consecutive steps. First, the subspace containing the true channel vector is estimated from the extended covariance matrix of the received data in a fully blind fashion, and then, the true channel vector is recovered from the obtained subspace using available training symbols. The parsimonious channel characterization that we use decreases the number of parameters required to be estimated. On the one hand, it results in a performance improvement as compared to the frequency domain channel estimation methods by coherent processing over all subcarriers. On the other hand, the bandwidth efficiency is enhanced by training overhead reduction as compared to the pure training-based approaches. Moreover, the proposed method is able to eliminate all nonscalar ambiguities inherent in blind channel estimation techniques in two practically important cases, the systems involving single-antenna receivers and the systems involving rotatable codes.	channel state information;code;coherence (physics);compaq lte;download;frame (networking);mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;occam's razor;overhead (computing);spectral efficiency;subcarrier	Julia Vinogradova;Nima Sarmadi;Marius Pesavento	2011	2011 4th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2011.6135911	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Robotics	45.9367762342211	79.76122512029062	178028
73a1788fef81d9dea4d8cf357809567161126dfb	advances in single carrier block modulation with frequency domain processing	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	This special issue focuses on single carrier block modulation (SC-BM) with frequency domain processing. This class of modulation and multiple access schemes complements the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and its variations. For example, LTE (the long term evolution of the 3GPP standard), and LTE-Advanced, employ OFDMA in the downlink (base stations to mobiles) and SC-FDMA, a version of SC-BM in the uplink (mobiles to base stations). The main reason for adapting the technology of SC-FDMA for uplink LTE is the fact that OFDMA has high “peak-to-average power ratio” (PAPR), which is a disadvantage for mobile devices that are limited by power availability. Besides its advantage of low PAPR, SC-BM technology has a similar performance/complexity to that of OFDMA, and simple frequency domain equalization methods for combating dispersive channels. There were 17 papers submitted to this special issue. All had merits, but the review process reduced the number of accepted papers to 9. The accepted papers cover a number of novel and advanced aspects of single carrier block modulation with frequency domain processing: near-optimal nonlinear and iterative equalization techniques; applications to CDMA, MIMO and ARQ; channel estimation; and application to free-space optical transmission. Following is a summary of the papers. In the paper “Iterative Successive Interference Cancellation for Quasi-Synchronous Block Spread CDMA Based on the Orders of the Times of Arrival”, Wang, Bocus, and Coon [1] describe an interference cancellation scheme based on the times of arrival of the signals from different users, and they show that for practical channels this ordering criterion is equivalent to ordering with respect to decreasing average SINR. In “Complexity Reduced MLD Based on QR Decomposition in OFDM MIMO Multiplexing with Frequency Domain Spreading and Code Multiplexing”, Nagatomi, Kawai, and Higuchi [2] propose a reduced-complexity maximum likelihood signal detection method for MIMO-OFDM systems with frequency-domain spreading and code multiplexing. They show how to exploit signal orthogonalization based on QR decomposition of the product of the channel and spreading code matrices in the frequency domain to obtain significant complexity reductions. In “Frequency-domain Block Signal detection with QRM-MLD for Training Sequence-aided Single-carrier Transmission”, Yamamoto, Takeda and Adachi [3] propose replacement of the cyclic prefix with a known training sequence. The object is to improve BER performance of an equalization scheme which uses QR decomposition with M-algorithm detection, while keeping the number of surviving paths low for reduced complexity. The scheme is especially effective for 16QAM and 64QAM modulation. The paper “Joint Iterative Tx/Rx MMSE-FDE and ISI Cancellation for Single-carrier Hybrid ARQ with Chase Combining” by Takeda and Adachi [4] applies transmitter and receiver equalization and iterative intersymbol interference cancellation to a system with hybrid ARQ transmission, Chase combining and antenna diversity. The equalizer parameters at both transmitter and receiver are optimized for each retransmission. The paper “Novel Techniques of Single Carrier Frequency Domain Equalization for Optical Wireless Communications” by Acolaste, Bar-Ness, and Wilson [5] investigates the application of single-carrier frequencydomain equalization to diffuse optical wireless communications and demonstrates its advantages over OFDM in terms of reduced PAPR and improved error rate in the presence of LED nonlinearity. In the paper “Semi-Blind Channel Estimation for IFDMA in Case of Channels with Large Delay Spreads”, Sohl and Klein [6] propose a subspace-based channel estimation algorithm which can cope with large delay spreads.

I N T R O D U C T I O N We consider a fast frequency hopping / multiple frequency shift keying (FFH/MFSK) multiple access (MA) system with M users that hop over 2” frequency channels with L hops (or chips) per symbol. Each user is assigned a unique Lchip address code for hopping over the 2K frequencies. The frequency channel occupied by a user on a given hop is determined by finite-field addition of the user’s address code and its transmitted symbol, as illustrated in Figure 1. For example, Figure la shows that during hop 1, users 1, 3, and 4 all transmit on frequency 3, user 2 transmits on frequency 7, and user 5 transmits on frequency 1. Figure l b displays the same information in a different way, where the numbers in each time-frequency (T-F) cell indicate the users that are transmitting in that cell. For example, users 1, 3, and 4 collide at frequency 3 during hop 1. The receiver detects the A4 user symbols by shifting the elements of the T-F matrix in Figure l b using finite-field subtraction of the address code for each user, yielding the “despread matrices” in Figures IC-lg. (The details of the finite field addition and subtraction are explained in Section 2.) Note that additive noise and fading are omitted from this example, so the receiver can reliably detect which T-F cells in the despread matrices contain user energy. Symbols are identified by complete rows in the despread matrices. Note from Figures Ic-If that the symbols for users 1, 2, 3, and 4 are recovered unambiguously, but the symbol for user 5 is ambiguous since two complete rows are present in the despread matrix. Row 6 is correct for user 5 , and the spurious row 4 is caused by multiuser interference. We will show in Section 2 that the structure of the multiuser interference can be exploited to correctly recover the symbol for user 5 . When additive noise and fading are present, additional errors occur because of T-F cell inserBrian M. Sadler Army Research Laboratory Adelphi, MD tions (detected energy where no user is present) and deletions (missed detection in T-F cells containing users). We assume that the users are symboland chip-synchronized in this paper, and extensions to the asynchronous case will be described elsewhere. The FFH/MFSK MA system considered in this paper was introduced by Viterbi [l]. Bit error rate (BER) formulas and optimum parameter design for this system are presented by Goodman, Henry, and Prabhu [2]. “Conventional detectors’’ (CD) are studied in [l] and [2] that do not exploit the structure of the multiuser interference. The CD first applies a threshold to detect energy in each cell of the received T-F matrix, then symbol decisions are made by examining the rows in the thresholded despread matrices that contain the most “hits”. The BER formulas in [l] and [2] for CD include the effects of multiuser interference as well as additive noise and fading through probabilities of insertion and deletion. The analysis in [l] and [2] is based on random address codes for the users. Einarsson [3] developed an algebraic approach to address code assignment that guarantees minimum interference among M 5 2K users. Multiuser detection for the FFH/MFSK MA system is considered in [4]-[18]. Timor [4, 51 proposed multiuser detectors that exploit the structure of Einarsson’s address codes. Fiebig [6] evaluated Timor’s multiuser scheme with additive noise and fading and demonstrated degraded performance compared with the noiseless case. Su, Hsiao, and Hung [7] proposed a modification of Timor’s scheme for improved performance in additive noise, and they also showed that Einarsson’s address codes perform almost as well with asynchronous users as with synchronous users. The multiuser detection schemes in [8]-[18] are valid with arbitrary address codes, i.e., they do not depend on the structure of Einarsson’s address codes. The MKI scheme presented by Mabuchi, Kohno, and Imai [8] achieves good performance but requires high complexity that grows exponentially with the number of users. The MKI scheme and Timor’s approach in [4][7] do not require knowledge of the received amplitudes for the user signals. Halford and Brandt-Pearce [9] proposed a method that exploits knowledge of the received signal amplitudes. The complexity of their scheme grows linearly with the number of users, and the algorithm incoherently cancels user signals from the received data. However, the energy of each user must be known precisely for the cancellation, which may be difficult to achieve in fading environments. Fiebig presents multiuser detection schemes in [lo]-[12]. Fiebig’s reduction of candidate matrices (REC) method in [ll] and [12] achieves nearly optimum performance with low complexity on interference-only channels (no additive noise). REC is no longer a maximum likelihood (ML) solution when noise and fading are present, and it suffers performance degradation on channels with noise and fading. In this paper, we present the ML multiuser detector for channels with additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading. We show that our algorithm improves 0-7803-6596-8/00/$10.00	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bit error rate;catastrophic interference;channel (communications);code;coherence (physics);download;elegant degradation;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);key (cryptography);linear algebra;loss of significance;matrix multiplication;modulation;multi-user;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;sensor;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Richard J.

The performance analysis of such systems is normally based on Monte Carlo simulations which are rather time consuming and provide little insight for system performance bottle necks. In this paper, an exact closed form expression for the bit error rate (BER) of M-ary pulse amplitude modulated (MPAM) single carrier (SC) schemes as a function of analog to digital converter (ADC) word length is presented. This expression is then used for the performance evaluation of MPAM schemes perturbed by Gaussian and ADC quantization noise (QN) in various fading scenarios. The expressions presented can also be used to determine the system performance in the presence of other RF imperfections such as phase noise in addition to ADC noise and thus provide the system designer with a handy tool for RF system design and optimization.	analog-to-digital converter;bit error rate;handy board;mathematical optimization;modulation;monte carlo method;performance evaluation;phase noise;quantization (signal processing);radio frequency;simulation;systems design;x.690	Umar H.

Only when one relay node is able to correctly decode the OSTBC codeword of the source, it will forward source information to the destination with the same OSTBC codeword. The exact SER expressions of DF relaying with OSTBC are presented for M-PSK and M-C1AM modulations, respectively, over dissimilar Rayleigh fading channels. By virtue of the multinomial theorem and the law of total probability, the derived expressions are further deduced in closed form. Simulations demonstrate the proposed closed-form analytical results. It is pointed out that such results have seldom appeared in literatures before.

Shannon in 1948, channel capacity has been regarded as the fundamental information-theoretic performance measure to predict the maximum information rate of a communication system. However, in contrast with the analysis of other important performance measures of wireless communication systems, a unified and general approach for computing the channel capacity over fading channels has yet to be proposed. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel and unified communication-theoretic framework for the analysis of channel capacity over fading channels. It is shown that the framework can handle various fading channel models, communication types, and adaptation transmission policies. In particular, the specific contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We introduce a transform operator, called the E i-transform, which is shown to provide a unified tool to compute the channel capacity with either side information at the receiver or side information at the transmitter and the receiver, directly from the moment-generating function (MGF) or the MGF and the truncated MGF of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) at the receiver, respectively; (2) we show that when either a channel inversion or a truncated channel inversion adaptation policy is considered, the channel capacity can readily be computed from the Mellin or the Hankel transform of the MGF of the received SNR, respectively; (3) a simple yet effective numerical method for the analysis of higher order statistics (HOS) of the channel capacity with side information at the receiver is introduced; and (4) some efficient and ad hoc numerical methods are explicitly introduced to allow the efficient computation of the proposed frameworks. Numerical and simulation results are also shown and compared to substantiate the analytical derivation.	a mathematical theory of communication;channel capacity;computation;hoc (programming language);information theory;numerical method;peak information rate;profiling (computer programming);shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter	Marco Di Renzo;Fabio Graziosi;Fortunato Santucci	2010	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2030894	computer simulation;binary erasure channel;transmitter;electronic engineering;spatial correlation;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;channel state information;fading;precoding;channel capacity;statistics	Mobile	40.83221330811458	75.01371491380431	179085

The proposed algorithm is an extension of the simulation-based algorithm for calculating information rates of channels with memory. We modify the algorithm by taking into account the fading coefficients. The capacity of CPM over Rayleigh fading channels is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation based on the assumptions that the input symbols at the CPM modulator are independent and uniformly distributed. We consider both the cases where the receiver has perfect knowledge of the channel state information as well as the receiver does not.	algorithm;channel state information;coefficient;modulation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;rf modulator;rayleigh fading;simulation	Rongting Chen;Fan Wei;Mengyu Huang;Bing Li;Baoming Bai	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542958	fading distribution;electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;rayleigh fading;channel state information	EDA	40.735893176280634	76.27848142343234	179327

The proposed SoD FDE-aided FTNS detector has low decoding complexity that linearly increases upon increasing the FTNS block length and, hence, is particularly beneficial for practical long-dispersion scenarios. Furthermore, extrinsic information transfer charts are utilized for designing a near-capacity three-stage-concatenated turbo FTNS system, which exhibits an explicit turbo cliff in the low-signal-to-noise-ratio region, hence outperforming its conventional two-stage-concatenated FTNS counterpart.	adobe framemaker;algorithm;block code;chart;concatenation;interference (communication);iteration;nyquist rate;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver	Shinya Sugiura;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2336984	electronic engineering;performance;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;signal-to-noise ratio;frequency domain;transceiver	Mobile	46.39264336224334	74.97962276246955	179865

We present three criteria: maximum channel gain, maximum capacity and max-min post-SNR, for selecting the optimal transmit antennas when linear, coherent receiver is used over a slowly varying channel. Simulation results suggest that the max-min post-SNR criterion outperforms the other selection methods in a variety of modulation modes, such as QPSK, 8PSK and 16QAM. Compared with BLAST-TAS, under the same spectral efficiency, LDC-TAS shows significant diversity advantage.

Predetection equal gain combining (EGC) and selection combining (SC) are considered. The fading is assumed to be flat and slow, and random spreading sequences are considered. The spectrum raised cosine (SRC) and Beaulieu-Tan-Damen (BTD) pulse shapes are employed. The improved Gaussian approximation for multiple access interference is employed with characteristic function and Fourier series methods for the performance analysis. Our results are valid for arbitrary diversity order and arbitrary Nakagami fading parameter and the computational complexity does not grow with the diversity order.

The scheme advocated was designed for enhancing the throughput, reliability and coverage area in a cooperative communication system. A twin-antenna Relay Node~(RN) is employed for assisting a pair of users, where each user is equipped with a single-antenna mobile unit. During the first transmission period, both users transmit their TTCM-encoded signals to the RN. The twin-antenna RN then detects these signals using various SDMA-based detection algorithms. Iterative SDMA and TTCM detection is invoked at the RN, which then broadcasts the re-encoded TTCM signals to both users during the second transmission period. Finally, each user retrieves the opposite user's signals received from the RN. Our proposed scheme outperforms the non-cooperative TTCM scheme by approximately 5.3~dBs at a BER of $10^{-6}$, when communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);concatenation;internet relay chat;mud;modulo operation;performance;rayleigh fading;ruby document format;signal-to-noise ratio;standard database management analysis;throughput;trellis quantization;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Wei Liang;Soon Xin Ng;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093297	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;integrated circuit	Mobile	44.52833496152016	77.2238309179986	180801

We consider a multiuser MIMO uplink environment, where each user carries Mt transmit antennas, but is allocated only one signature sequence. Compared with the conventional V-BLAST, the modified scheme gains advantage mainly in two aspects: firstly, it is able to recover the transmitted information from only one receive antenna, whereas the conventional V- BLAST requires that Mr ges Mt (Mr is the number of receive antenna); secondly, the modified system could achieve the maximum possible diversity gain Mr of V-BLAST at the cost of limited multiplexing gain, whereas the diversity gain is only Mr - Mt + 1 in conventional V-BLAST with ZF detector. The exact closed-form expression of bit error rate (BER) is derived for an Mt times Mr modified system with ZF strategy. And further explanation for the performance difference between the modified and conventional scheme is given from the spatial correlation point of view. Finally, we compare the performance of our proposed system with the conventional scheme by computer simulations which validate the analytical results.	blast;bit error rate;cs-blast;computer simulation;mimo-ofdm;maximal set;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;point of view (computer hardware company);pseudorandom number generator;telecommunications link;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Shihai Shao;Youxi Tang;Ting Kong;Shaoqian Li	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.921	computer simulation;spatial correlation;real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;spatial multiplexing;statistics	Mobile	42.091807096011934	81.32861703898135	181324

The existing constellation extension (CE) schemes do not need to transmit side information. In this paper, we propose an improved CE scheme for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals with 16-QAM modulation. The proposed CE scheme has four extendable constellation points, the four corners in the 16-QAM constellation, and each extendable constellation point has two possible extended constellation points. The proposed CE scheme, when compared with previous related CE schemes, has fewer extendable constellation points and more corresponding extended constellation points, resulting in better BER performance with almost the same PAPR reduction. Computer simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	delta-sigma modulation;extensibility;frequency divider;multiplexing;norm (social);power architecture platform reference;simulation;spectral efficiency;transmitter;x.690	Chin-Liang Wang;Shun-Sheng Wang;Yi-Ching Huang	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956702	computer simulation;electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;degradation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;constellation diagram;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	EDA	46.22597074606824	79.64718311552338	182775

The inner detector consists of a sub-optimal maximum a- posteriori symbol-by-symbol decoding algorithm with a successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme. The complexity of the inner detector is not more complex than the corresponding detector for a memoryless modulation scheme. The inner decoder together with a standard BCJR forms the iterative decoding loop. The SIC scheme is used to eliminate the intentional interference caused by symbols stacked beyond their orthogonality limit. As compared to prior work, the iterative decoder has been adapted to make the FTN technique feasible for hardware implementation. The results show that such modifications does not affect the performance of the receiver. The receiver has been evaluated under various other FTN system parameters to determine the performance.	bcjr algorithm;bell laboratories layered space-time;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;modulation;nyquist rate;operating point;simplified instructional computer;spectral efficiency	Deepak Dasalukunte;Fredrik Rusek;Viktor Öwall	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502554	soft-decision decoder;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	Robotics	46.01283442618072	74.80720623961763	183611

The employment of multiple active antennas instead of a single active antenna is proposed for increasing the achievable throughput and the joint design of the antenna selection and classic transmit symbol is explored, while maintaining the compelling advantages of SM. This framework combines the bit-to-antenna mapping and classic bit-to-constellation mapping into a single function, which defines the joint-alphabet and the joint optimization of the amplitude-phase modulation and its constellation for transmission over multiple active antennas. The conventional SM system is also interpreted within our framework. An example design is proposed, which aims for a high spectral efficiency of 11 b per channel use, achieving a gain of up to 5 dB over generalized SM (GSM).	channel use;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;radio frequency;spectral efficiency;throughput	Pranav S.

We tackle this problem and present a novel receiver consisting of a single filter and a subsequent sequence detector. This receiver outperforms the conventional discriminator detector by more than 4 dB for typical Bluetooth channels. Thereby, the proposed sequence detection (SD) algorithm is of favorable low complexity, as it operates on a two-state trellis, and is highly robust against channel phase variations caused by low-cost local oscillators. Different from previously published work on SD, we take possible variations of the Bluetooth modulation parameters into account. Hence, the presented receiver design is an attractive solution for practical Bluetooth devices.	adaptive algorithm;bluetooth;decibel;discriminator;filter design;finite-state machine;interference (communication);modulation;performance per watt;quantum phase estimation algorithm;trellis quantization;zero suppression	Mani Jain;Lutz H.-J.

The receiver is capable of demodulating all overlapping, unit-length packets, provided that the T-length packet headers do not overlap, and at most K packets overlap at any one time. If one of these conditions is violated, the remainder of the busy period is assumed to be unresolvable. Assuming that the aggregate packet arrival process is Poisson, the authors analyze the throughput as a function of the total offered load (/spl lambda/), the maximum number of resolvable overlapping packets (K), and the fractional header duration (T). They derive an iterative expression for the throughput for K=2 or 3, generalizable to larger K, which permits solution of the throughput to arbitrary accuracy. A closed form solution is given for the case K=2 and T=0.5. The authors provide bounds on the throughput for arbitrary K, /spl lambda/, and T, which are more convenient than the exact approach for T>0 or large K. Numerical results illustrate the improvement in throughput due to multiuser detection, and suggest a technique for finding the minimum complexity multiuser receiver (minimum K) as a function of other system parameters. >	throughput	David Brady;Lazaros F.

ISOT allows $K$ symbols to be simultaneously transmitted without increasing channel bandwidth, and the symbol transmission interval can be decreased to $Ts/K$, assuming that $Ts$ is the symbol duration. In additive white gaussian noise(AWGN) channel, we study the ISOT system which symbol rate is greater than system bandwidth. Though inter-symbol overlapping transmission doesn't increase channel bandwidth, the spectrum efficiency can be increased by $K$ times in theory. Simulation results show that ISOT can achieve higher spectrum efficiency compared with high dimension modulation, even if low dimension BPSK or QPSK modulation is used. Furthermore, we integrate ISOT with single-carrier frequency domain equalization(SC-FDE) and evaluate its BER performance. Simulation results show that ISOT integrated with SC-FDE has significant performance improvement comparing to SC-FDE with ^{K}$-QAM, while ISOT uses QPSK modulation to transmit $K$ symbols simultaneously. Simulation also shows that the more the symbols overlapping, the more the performance improvement. Inter-symbol overlapping transmission scheme can be used in mobile device and used as a uplink transmission technology in mobile communication systems, such as B3G or 4G, to provide higher spectrum efficiency.	additive white gaussian noise;adobe framemaker;carrier frequency;interference (communication);mobile device;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Menghui Yang;Tonghong Li;Weikang Yang;Xin Su;Jing Wang	2009	2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing	10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.38	electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;communication	Mobile	43.9806424216658	80.51086395815585	184965

The theoretical bit-error-rate (BER) expressions conditioned on the number of users and the sequence length (and the number of resolvable paths for multipath frequency-selective fading) are obtained. The theoretical approximation of the BER for the system using long-sequence-length complete complementary codes is investigated as well. The simulations are conducted over flat-fading and two-path frequency-selective fading channels and have been used to verify the theoretical analysis. The results show that the proposed CC-ST-CDMA system has a comparable BER performance with complete complementary code-based multicarrier direct-sequence code-division multiple access (CC-MC-DSCDMA) for a flat-fading channel.

Such knowledge is of significant importance to estimate several concerns associated with the non-linearity of power amplifiers, e.g., required back-off level or clipping distortion in amplified signals. However, existing works often rely on Monte-Carlo simulations, since analytical derivation of the statistical distribution of SC signals is a complex problem involving combined dependency of a constellation format and a pulse shape. In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose two new analytical methods based on the uniform distribution approximation of discrete signal points. The derived expressions can be easily evaluated and serve as tight upper bounds for high-order pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).	amplifier;approximation;convolution;discrete-time signal;distortion;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;polynomial;pulse-width modulation;simulation;star catalogue	Makoto Tanahashi;Hideki Ochiai	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.03.091023	computer simulation;telecommunications;calculus;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method;quadrature modulation	Mobile	41.553731503821446	76.94370292043229	185655

MIMO systems have been shown to yield a tremendous capacity for a single link with white Gaussian noise. In a cellular environment, there will often be co-channel interference from other cells, which becomes the dominating channel impairment. Here space-time layered architectures and turbo processing techniques are combined with multiuser detection techniques for combating intercell interference. Among various multiuser detection methods examined, linear MMSE and successive interference cancellation have been shown to be feasible and effective. Based on these two multiuser detection schemes, one of which may outperform the other for different settings, an adaptive detection scheme is developed.	bell laboratories layered space-time;information theory;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;scheme;telecommunications link;turbo code	Huaiyu Dai;Andreas F.

Different from previous studies, these results hold for arbitrary orders of M and L as well as for any real values of fading severity index m 2 0.5. A simple procedure for deriving an exact closed-form expression for the MGF of SNR when the fading index assumes a positive integer m value is also outlined. These MGFs are then used to derive the average symbol error probability (ASEP) for a broad class o f binary and M-ary modulations employing coherent SClMRC receiver. Analytical expressions for computing the outage rate oferror probability and the average combined output SNR are also derived. Finally, computationally efficient but approximate solutions for the M G F of SNR are presented.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;bitwise operation;coherence (physics);downtime;generalized selection;power dividers and directional couplers;signal-to-noise ratio	Annamalai Annamalai;Chintha Tellambura	2000		10.1109/WCNC.2000.904632	telecommunications;cumulative distribution function;word error rate;computer science;noise;probability of error;mathematics;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;moment-generating function;statistics;approximation theory;modulation	Theory	40.38119053188615	76.00729974233488	186532

However, the residual inter-chip interference (ICI) is produced after MMSE-FDE and degrades the BER performance. Recently, we showed that frequency-domain ICI cancellation can bring the BER performance close to the theoretical lower bound. To further improve the BER performance, transmit antenna diversity technique is effective. Cyclic delay transmit diversity (CDTD) can increase the number of equivalent paths and hence achieve a large frequency diversity gain. Space-time transmit diversity (STTD) can obtain antenna diversity gain due to the space-time coding and achieve a better BER performance than CDTD. In this paper, we point out that the performance difference between CDTD and STTD is mainly due to the residual ICI. We theoretically show that the introduction of ICI cancellation into DS-CDMA/MMSE-FDE gives almost the same BER performance for CDTD and STTD. This is confirmed by computer simulation.	adobe framemaker;bit error rate;computer simulation;data rate units;eb-eye;eb/n0;elegant degradation;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mean squared error;rake;throughput;x.690	Kazuaki Takeda;Yohei Kojima;Fumiyuki Adachi	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.225	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;space–time code;frequency domain;statistics	Mobile	44.69712803323005	78.61051770487693	186783

Depending on the channel realization, the receiver decides the optimal beamforming vector on each subcarrier, and informs the transmitter through a rate-limited feedback link. Exploiting the fact that the channel responses across OFDM subcarriers are correlated, we propose two methods to reduce the amount of needed feedback. One is recursive feedback encoding that selects the optimal beamforming vectors sequentially across the subcarriers, and adopts a smaller-size time-varying codebook per subcarrier depending on prior decisions. The other is trellis-based feedback encoding that selects the optimal beamforming vectors for all subcarriers at once along a trellis structure via the A. The trellis-based feedback encoding outperforms the recursive feedback encoding at the expense of encoding complexity at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that our trellis-based approach outperforms an existing interpolation-based alternative, as the latter incurs diversity loss at high SNR	beamforming;codebook;elegant degradation;feedback;horner's method;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interpolation;mimo;mimo-ofdm;recursion (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter;trellis quantization	Shengli Zhou;Baosheng Li;Peter Willett	2005	GLOBECOM '05.

Assuming perfect knowledge of channel state information at the receiver, the scheme has been shown to exploit multipath diversity in addition to spatial diversity and coding gain. In this paper, we remove the assumption of ideal channel estimation and investigate the performance of the scheme in the presence of magnitude or phase error estimates. We show that the diversity advantage of the scheme relies heavily on accurate channel estimation and quantify the degradation associated with imperfect channel estimates. Results indicate that a phase error of up to 10 degrees or an amplitude error below 15% are tolerable, such that the diversity advantage of the scheme is maintained. Within these limits, the iterative process provides significant performance gains in the f is t and second iterations, while diminishing returns are observed for more than two iterations. Finally, we compare our simulation results with outage probability analysis bounds.	channel state information;coding gain;convolutional code;downtime;elegant degradation;iteration;mimo;multipath propagation;simulation;trellis quantization	Ran Gozali;Brian D.

In this paper, a ZCZ-CDMA system with binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) modulation called BFSK-ZCZ-CDMA is proposed. This system is characterized by using a pair of balanced ZCZ codes for spreading and transmitting the two spread components over the respective keying carrier frequencies. Its bit error rate performance, compared with those of existing BPSK-ZCZ-CDMA, ASK-ZCZ-CDMA, and CDMA systems using the other spreading codes, is evaluated in theory and simulation. The bit error rate performance of the three ZCZ-CDMA systems over additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels are formulated. It is proved that BFSK-ZCZ-CDMA is much more robust in anti-fading performance and low transmit power in such an environment that fading distributions on the keying frequencies are independent mutually. Fading versus frequency characteristics are also investigated. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.		Jincheng Huang;Shinya Matsufuji;Takahiro Matsumoto;Noriyoshi Kuroyanagi	2012	Int. J.

The OFDM PAPR problem is addressed and investigated using SLM reduction technique. Next, an OFDM system with a multi-h CPFSK mapper is considered and its performance is evaluated in terms of the upper and lower bounds on bit error rate probability, and a closed form expression is obtained. Also, the system performance is examined over Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels. The simulation and analytical results show that the performance of the system is superior than the OFDM system with BPSK and single-h CPFSK mappers.	bit error rate;carrier recovery;itil;modulation;power architecture platform reference;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Emammer Shafter;Abdulbaset M.

The downlink MU-MIMO system is constructed as a transmitter with 6 antennas and receivers with 2 antennas, and the maximum number of users(receivers) is 3. In computer simulation, MU-MIMO transmission system can be realized by using the BD (Block Diagonalization) algorithm, and each user can receive signals without any signal interferences between the other users. BER (Bit Error Rate) performance and channel capacity according to modulation schemes and the number of streams are simulated in spatially correlated multipath fading environment. In field experiment, received power and downlink throughput in UDP layer are measured on the mobile WiMAX system developed at Azumino City in Japan. Compared with the simulated and experimented results, the measured maximum throughput performance in downlink has almost the same performance with the simulated throughput. It is confirmed that the experimental mobile WiMAX system for MU-MIMO transmission is actually performed for increasing the total channel capacity of the system.	algorithm;bit error rate;blu-ray;channel capacity;computer simulation;data rate units;experiment;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;maximum throughput scheduling;modulation;multi-user mimo;multipath propagation;performance evaluation;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Kazuhiro Yamaguchi;Takaharu Nagahashi;Takuya Akiyama;Hideaki Matsue;Kunio Uekado;Takakazu Namera;Hiroshi Fukui;Satoshi Nanamatsu	2015	2015 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2015.7057890	wimax;throughput;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;bit error rate;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;channel capacity;computer network	Mobile	41.77148018864248	81.03896600758281	187298

0b8277ffe6f0ae504ce27f28f8c1795b5571042b	evaluation of cooperative diversity techniques using stc for future s-dmb services	cooperative diversity;antenna diversity;spatial diversity;space time code;transmit diversity;space time coding	This paper presents an evaluation of various cooperative diversity techniques applied to future satellite digital multimedia broadcasting (S-DMB) systems. The increasing importance of hybrid and/or integrated satellite and terrestrial networks is associated with the utilization of spatial diversity techniques such as antenna diversity using space-time coding. The space-time coding schemes can be expected to result in more diversity gain as the number of transmit antennas are increased. However, we cannot design a rate-1 scheme that achieves full diversity for more than two transmit antennas. To overcome this limitation, quasi-orthogonal schemes were proposed, at the expense of the decoder complexity and diversity gain. In this paper, we introduce an efficient quasi-orthogonal space time coding scheme, and evaluate various aspects associated with the application of the proposed scheme to satellite systems. The proposed scheme in this paper provides the full rate as well as maximum-likelihood decoding via simple linear detection.

Based on the improved approach for the interpath interference (U-IPI) introduced in [4], we propose analytical expressions for the bit and frame error rate (BEIUFER) at the output of the Viterbi decoder with soft decision decoding. The BER and FER of the forward traffic channel of an IS-95 system are then derived by computer simulation of the entire system and by numerical evaluation of analytic expressions. Results for several cases involving different numbers of antenna elements and different levels of interference from other cells are presented. The analytical models are shown to be most efficient in terms of computational cost while preserving excellent accuracy.	algorithmic efficiency;analytical engine;catastrophic interference;computation;computer simulation;convolutional code;error detection and correction;interference (communication);numerical analysis;performance evaluation;telecommunications link;viterbi decoder;x.690	Mario Rafael Hueda;Carmen E.

However, it may lose its interference-resistance feature and suffer performance degradation over asynchronous frequency-selective fading channels due to the fact that it is incapable of reconstructing ideal complementary cross-correlation functions at a receiver. Based on the analysis on combining and detection algorithms designed for CC-CDMA systems, this paper proposes a joint pre-equalization and adaptive combining scheme. Pre-equalization is used at a transmitter to either enhance diversity gain or compensate channel selectivity leveraged by a controlling parameter ζ, whereas a recursive least square (RLS) adaptive combining algorithm is employed at a receiver to determine the optimal combining coefficients, aiming at minimizing detection errors under different channel conditions. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of bit error rate (BER) and its adaptability to varying channel states.	algorithm;bit error rate;camera serial interface;code;coefficient;cross-correlation;elegant degradation;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);recursion;recursive least squares filter;selectivity (electronic);simulation;systems design;transmitter;x.690	Siyue Sun;Yin-Long Hu;Hsiao-Hwa Chen;Weixiao Meng	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2467967	code division multiple access;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;correlation;fading;transceiver	Embedded	45.729710042928176	78.38482452741405	189059

The efficiencies are analytically calculated using the transmitted power distributions. Several well-known multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) diversity techniques, power control rules, PA classes, and channel models are considered. The considered diversity techniques are maximum ratio combining, selection combining, transmitting antenna selection, and maximum ratio transmission. Also the probability of an OFDM symbol clipping caused by PA saturation is calculated for the system under study. The analytical results are verified using Monte Carlo simulations. The study shows that the input signal distribution, diversity techniques, and the power control cutoff value have a significant effect on the average PA efficiency. The highest average PA efficiency is achieved when input signal has constant amplitude and selection combining is used. The presented results can be applied for an arbitrary PA e.g. when comparing the efficiency of different PAs.	amplifier;baseband;channel (communications);mimo;monte carlo method;pa-risc;simulation;transmitter	Olli Apilo;Mika Lasanen;Aarne Mämmelä;Friedrich Jondral	2011	2011 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS)	10.1109/WTS.2011.5960854	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;diversity gain	Mobile	40.71027572707318	77.48481012485631	189263

Power estimation of the signal component is based on the power control (PC) subchannel symbol whose power is independent of the vocoder frame rate which can vary. An effective method of removing PC bit modulation and equalizing channel variation is proposed to coherently combine PC symbols. Power estimation of the noise component is accomplished by a differential approach to reduce the effect of errors introduced by fading and by increasing the noise sample size. Performance of the estimation algorithm is verified through computer simulations. Results show that the long term average frame error rate (FER) performance of the proposed algorithm is less than 1.5 dB from that of perfect SNR estimation.	signal-to-noise ratio	Scott S H Tsai;Young C.

The effect is quantified in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM). It is shown that using independent phase noise sources improves EVM performance in the main lobe. It is further shown that when forming beams using antenna amplitude attenuation (tapering) for groups of correlated noise sources, lowest EVM is obtained when correlated noise sources are assigned to tapered amplitudes in a way which minimizes the differences between the sums of the tapering coefficients of the groups. Bounds for the variance of the phase noise in the main lobe are provided. Further a method achieving secure communication by forming a secure beam by adding uncorrelated phase noise to the antenna elements is presented.	acoustic lobing;beamforming;coefficient;phase noise;secure communication	Thomas Hähne;Ville Ranki	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.092810.091059	gradient noise;gaussian noise;effective input noise temperature;noise spectral density;error vector magnitude;noise;secure communication;earned value management;telecommunications;noise temperature;computer science;antenna noise temperature;mathematical model;interference;noise figure;noise floor;beamforming;phase noise;statistics	Visualization	40.94212632051931	77.81929006440957	189378

Similar to that of the traditional generalized spatial modulation (GSM), a subset of the entire transmit antennas is selected for transmission at each time slot. Nevertheless, in the proposed TCGSM scheme, the bits in the spatial domain are first coded by the trellis encoder before antenna selection. The purpose is to combat the correlation of the MIMO channel and hence improve the system performance. We give the detailed system model as well as the trellis encoding/decoding algorithm for the proposed scheme. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through both theoretical analysis and simulations. The results indicate that the proposed scheme is spectral efficient and robust against the channel correlation.	algorithm;encoder;mimo;modulation;monte carlo method;power of two;simulation;spectral efficiency;trellis quantization	You Zhou;Dongfeng Yuan;Xiaotian Zhou;Haixia Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE 79th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2014.7023130	gsm;electronic engineering;convolutional code;telecommunications;space–time trellis code;computer science;correlation;computer network;modulation	Mobile	43.75574685366931	78.07375505686475	190293

The achievable performance with signal space diversity (SSD) is analyzed and a closed form expression for the upper bound of average probability of bit error (Pb) for M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) in Rayleigh fading channel is presented. The problem of calculating Pb of coherent MPSK over a Rayleigh fading channel has been studied previously in the literature. A solution based on the nearest neighbors was given. In this paper we show that the results with the nearest neighbor approximation represent an expurgated bound and are only valid for a small range of rotational angles. Exact pair-wise error probability (PEP) is derived for Rayleigh fading channels. It is shown that Gray signal constellation mapping is not necessarily the best option for a system employing coordinate interleaving and constellation rotation. Rotation angles are optimized by finding the minimum of the upper bound of Pb. It is shown that the new derived bound is tight for the entire range of rotational angles at high signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the performance of the system in case of phase estimation error is also investigated by simulations.	approximation;backup rotation scheme;bit error rate;coherence (physics);forward error correction;key (cryptography);modulation;profiling (computer programming);quantum phase estimation algorithm;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;solid-state drive	Nauman F.

Using powerful set partitioning, these codes are able to combine the coding advantage of STTC's together with the advantage diversity of orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC). The system we propose is named super quasi orthogonal horizontal layered space time trellis code (SQOHLSTTC). It consists in a powerful STBC based STTC originally derived for a three transmit antenna system, together with an original block based decoding algorithm which enables to use a higher number of transmit antennas. The decoding of SQOHLSTTC combines group interference suppression and group interference cancellation techniques.

It is seen that performance is clearly degraded by the presence of nonuniform spatial distributions of interference. The degree of impairment is related to the actual shape of the distribution and becomes more significant when large amounts of interfering power are concentrated in one or more angular directions. As compared to a reference case with a uniform distribution of equivalent interfering power, the mean acquisition time could increase by factors of up to four. Some effective approaches to compensate for the loss of performance due to the uneven nature of interference are also studied. First, the effect of search strategies in the delay and angular domains on acquisition performance is assessed. A searching algorithm up-ranking angular cells according to the amount of associated interference is proposed as one solution to reduce the performance gap. It is shown that applying this search strategy can considerably reduce the mean acquisition time. Finally, two adaptive schemes based on setting integration times or threshold values according to the level of interference prevailing in each angular cell, are discussed. The former approach returns performance figures similar to those obtained with the uniform equivalent interference distribution while the latter provide moderate performance gains.	adaptive quadrature;angularjs;elegant degradation;interference (communication);misuse case;search algorithm	Marcos D.

By upper bounding the pairwise error probability (PEP) expression, we show that the system with channel estimation error (CEE) still achieves full diversity. The loss in coding gain (LCG) and the loss in performance (LP) expressions are derived. It is shown that while equal power training performs about 3 dB worse than the perfect CSI case, the optimal power training performs between the two depending on the number of subcarriers assigned per OFDM word.

A new closed-form expression is derived for the conditional characteristic function of the cochannel interference. Furthermore, a new BER expression involving only a single integration is derived invoking the characteristic function approach and hypergeometric functions of two variables. The accuracy of our BER expression is confirmed by our simulation results for various spreading sequence lengths and various Ricean K-factors. By contrast, the standard Gaussian approximation (SGA) overestimates the BER of Rayleigh fading channels, when there is no line-of-sight (LOS) component and it under-estimates the BER, when the LOS component becomes stronger.	approximation;bit error rate;characteristic function (convex analysis);interference (communication);k-factor (cisco);line-of-sight (missile);modulation;rayleigh fading;simulation;synthetic genetic array;x.690	Xiang Liu;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.437	code division multiple access;electronic engineering;characteristic function;hypergeometric function;bit error rate;telecommunications;phase-shift keying;sequence;mathematics;statistics;approximation theory	Embedded	40.86486103201224	75.53631205250421	192132

In this paper, a modified maximum-likelihood decoding method with the utilization of a multiplexer at the transmitter and a demultiplexer at the receiver to isolate each transmitted signal at the corresponding receiver is presented. With this modified approach, the STTC-OFDM gives a better frame error rate (FER) performance than the traditional one over the Rayleigh frequency selective fading channels. The Doppler impact is additionally considered for the aggregate system to contrast the proposed methodology and the existing STTC-OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the modified STTC-OFDM framework enhances the FER performance by almost 4 dB at the FER value of 10-2 where the Doppler frequency equals to zero at the receiver. Even if a Doppler frequency exists in the system, the proposed scheme still gives a better performance than the existing STTC-OFDM systems.	aggregate data;decoding methods;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;multiplexer;multiplexing;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;transmitter;trellis quantization	Samet Yildiz;Hen-Geul Yeh	2016	2016 24th Signal Processing and Communication Application Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2016.7495975	electronic engineering;real-time computing;geography;telecommunications	HPC	43.94281482211086	79.18135167052885	192437

Software simulated results for frequency collisions between piconets operating in both synchronous and asynchronous modes with typical up and downlink loading factors are presented (for time-bounded and non-time bounded electronic devices). The significance of this interference on the data throughput in a number of example scenarios is investigated using a state-of-the-art indoor space-time propagation model. These results are then compared with measured channel data taken in the test environment using a MEDAV RUSK BRI channel sounder.

Optical code division multiple access (CDMA) is one of the solutions to transmit several data streams simultaneously in the system. We propose a visible-light communication system using optical CDMA with red-green-blue (RGB) multichip LEDs. The proposed method has advantages of reducing the number of LEDs since each multi-chip device includes three light sources and of cancelling multi-user interferences without using colored filters. Computer simulation shows the validity of the proposed scheme.	bit error rate;card security code;computer simulation;diode;magic user interface;multi-user;multiplexing	Shinichiro Miyazaki;Tomoko K.

The evaluation is limited to different open loop transmit diversity techniques using two, three and four transmit antennas without any knowledge of the wireless channel at the transmitter. The achievable data rates through multiantenna techniques are evaluated as link level throughputs with a UTRA FDD downlink model for HSDPA, using a conventional RAKE receiver with one and two receiving antennas. The model includes H-ARQ, while the dynamic link adaptation is not modelled explicitly. The results show that most of the performance gain is achieved with additional receiving antenna, while the gain from transmit diversity is rather limited and in some cases even negative.	mimo;network packet;telecommunications link;transmitter	Kari Majonen;Markku J.

The proposed scheme is assumed to be applied to the uplink of Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. Since the transmission rates of IoT applications are small, each uplink connection may occupy less than 12 subcarriers that corresponds to one resource block (RB) of the LTE. Since the length of the data sequence in time domain is short so that CDD may provide limited frequency diversity. The proposed scheme shifts the phases of the data symbols in time domain and spreads each subcarrier component over multiple subcarriers. Thus, more diversity gain can be realized with CDD. Numerical results obtained through computer simulation shows that the proposed scheme improves the performance by about 5 - 7 dB at the bit error rate (BER) of 104 for the data sequence length of 4.	bit error rate;cdd;carrier frequency;compaq lte;computer simulation;frequency divider;internet of things;subcarrier;telecommunications link;x.690	Yuka Enjoji;Yukitoshi Sanada	2015	2015 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2015.7432812	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Arch	43.75248255306283	81.01926685950401	193904

For conventional intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) MIMO-OWC with Gaussian noise, repetition code (RC), which transmits the same pulse amplitude modulation symbols, has been proved to be the diversity-optimal space-only constellation. However, different from IM/DD MIMO-OWC with Gaussian noise, the output of SPAD MIMO-OWC is Poisson distributed due to the photon-counting nature of SPADs. For such a system, the maximum likelihood function is difficult to provide a useful insight into energy-efficient signal designs. In this letter, we develop a vector-version Anscombe root transform-based receiver, for which the minimum Hellinger distance of transmitted constellation dominates the error performance. Then, an energy-efficient space constellation is attained by maximizing the worst case minimum Hellinger distance for a fixed average transmitted optical power within the non-negative orthants of a multidimensional space. Comprehensive simulations indicate that our proposed space constellation significantly outperforms RC, which is the best space constellation currently available for this system.	best, worst and average case;diode;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;optical wireless;repetition code;simulation	Ling-Han Si-Ma;Jian Zhang;Bin-Qiang Wang;Yan-Yu Zhang	2017	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2650234	telecommunications;manganese;mathematics;adaptive optics	EDA	39.8348317129914	74.5502975471726	193915

Our analysis demonstrates that NBI may be an issue in some instances. In addition, we suggest three NBI suppression schemes for combating NBI in UWB TH systems. Single-link performance of these schemes in conjunction with a Rake-type receiver structure is estimated for both the ideal all-Rake receiver and the simpler partial-Rake receiver in an indoor environment. Two UWB pulse shapes that meet the Federal Communications Commission rules for UWB communications are considered in the investigation.	approximation algorithm;complexity;frequency band;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;information systems research;interference (communication);multipath propagation;rake;simulation;ultra-wideband;zero suppression	Xiaoli Chu;Ross D.

A shift in frequency caused by such channel leads to a loss of orthogonality between users. In this paper, we propose a DFT-SOFDM scheme augmented by MIMO and a new technique to overcome the adverse effects caused by Doppler shift. Repeated Alamouti orthogonal space time block codes are used for transmission of localized MIMO DFT-SOFDM signal. We derive the Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) combining and estimation scheme that ensures superior BER performance compared to the conventional Maximal-Ratio Receive Combining (MRRC) scheme. The proposed receiver provides a performance gain of 8.6 dB for a 4 users system at BER= 10-3. This gain improves with increased number of users. MRRC gives an error floor due to multiple access interference, which increases with system load.	code;decibel;discrete fourier transform;doppler effect;elegant degradation;error floor;interference (communication);load (computing);mimo;mimo-ofdm;maximal set;multiplexing;selectivity (electronic);simulation;telecommunications link;transceiver;x.690	Meng Wah Chia;Boon Sim Thian;Tjeng Thiang Tjhung	2008	2008 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Pervasive Computing	10.1109/ISWPC.2008.4556171	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	44.80857473015839	77.14241924941804	194063

The proposed system can provide a low cost, flexible, and high-bandwidth access network for multiple users. To investigate the system performance, we consider a special case of dual-hop WDM-FSO system taking into account the effects of all noises, interchannel crosstalk, as well as path loss and geometric spreading of optical beam over atmospheric turbulence channels. In addition, pulse position modulation (PPM) is employed for improving the overall performance. Our results show that OAF technique combined with PPM scheme can be a good solution for mitigating the effect of atmospheric turbulence. Moreover, the required amplifier gain corresponding to a specific value of BER, transmission distance, and turbulence strength is quantitatively discussed. Finally, the adverse effect of interchannel crosstalk in the upstream transmission is also evaluated.	access network;amplifier;crosstalk;modulation;multi-user;numerical analysis;optical fiber;turbulence;wavelength-division multiplexing;x.690	Phuc V.

Such an iterative (turbo) process is difficult to describe in a closed form so the performance evaluation is often done by means of extensive numerical simulations. Analytical methods for performance evaluation have also been proposed in the literature, based on Gaussian approximation of the output of the linear signal combiner. In this paper, we propose to use mutual information to parameterize the logarithmic likelihood rations (LLRs) at the input/output of the decoder, casting our approach into the framework of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis. We find the EXIT functions of the front-end (FE) receiver analytically, i.e., using solely the information about the channel state. This is done, decomposing the FE receiver into elementary blocks described independently. Our method gives an insight into the principle of functioning of the linear turbo receivers, allows for an accurate calculation of the expected bit error rate in Part of the work presented in this paper was submitted to the 15th IEEE International symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC) 2004, Barcelona, Spain, and to 17th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004, Niagara Falls.

However, their high performance critically requires log likelihood ratio computations with prohibitive complexity. This challenge will be addressed in this paper. We first use the assumption of Gaussian transmit symbols to show the equivalence among several existing algorithms. We next develop a non-Gaussian approximation for high-order constellations, which paves the way for interference cancellation-based detectors.

The irradiance fluctuations of the received signal are modeled by the K distribution convenient in strong atmospheric turbulence conditions. The hardware imperfections of PSK demodulator are taken into account, which are presented through the phase noise modeled by Tikhonov distribution. Numerical results are presented and confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. The numerical results illustrate the effects of atmospheric turbulence strength and phase noise on SEP performance. The existence of hardware imperfections, presented through phase noise, degrades the FSO system performance to a large extent.	k-distribution;modulation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;phase noise;pre-shared key;simulation;subcarrier;subscriber identity module;symantec endpoint protection;turbulence	Milica I.

Furthermore, we develop closed form expression for bandwidth and dimension of the signal after the chirp pulse compression that was lacking before. Two usual types of non-coherent IR-UWB detection are considered - energy detection of PPM-modulated symbols and sample-wise differential detection of DPSK-modulated symbols. These detection schemes show deterioration of bit error probability performance with an increase of the dimension of the signal in detection. The performance of the aforementioned detection schemes improves significantly when chirp pulse compression is applied, i.e. when dimension of the signal in detection is reduced. As we show, this performance enhancement happens in noise as well as in multi-user interference.	bit error rate;burst error;burst transmission;chirp;chirp z-transform;coherence (physics);interference (communication);modulation;multi-user;pulse compression;ultra-wideband;waveform	Igor Dotlic;Ryu Miura	2012	The 15th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications		telecommunications;chirp spread spectrum	Arch	43.86915471925065	76.79688246823387	196022

The chip weighting waveforms under consideration are designed for multiple-access interference (MAI) rejection. Assuming that the received chip waveforms are rectangular, new expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the decision variable are derived when different weighted despreading sequences (WDS’s) are used in the receiver. The novelty of the derived expressions is that each of the expressions, when the system parameters are given, is determined only by one parameter of the adjustable chip waveforms employed. As a result, we can simply tune the parameter to its optimal value in real-time for MAI rejection without knowing the other users’ spreading codes, timing, and phase. The criterion for tuning the parameter is to maximize the SINR of the decision variable based on the relative strength between the additive Gaussian white noise and the MAI. Numerical results show that when the multiple-access interference is significant, the receivers using WDS’s outperform significantly the conventional receiver using a rectangular despreading sequence. Brief analysis for bandlimited spreading signals is also provided to reveal the practical implications of the proposed technique.	additive white gaussian noise;bandlimiting;code;coherence (physics);intelligence amplification;interference (communication);optimization problem;real-time clock;rejection sampling;remote desktop services;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Yuejin Huang;Tung-Sang Ng	1999	IEEE Trans.

Wideband wave propagation models however, include algorithms to characterize the radio channel. For digital radio systems the BER of the unprotected radio channel is an important parameter. In the approach presented in this paper, the influence of multipath propagation on different digital modulation schemes is investigated. The calculations are based on a 3D wave propagation model, which yields a Fieldstrength-DelaySpectrum (FDS). The FDS is defmed by amplitudes and delays of incident waves, which contribute to intersymbol interference due to multipath propagation. Two algorithms for computation of the BER evaluating the FDS, for both linear and non-linear digital modulation schemes are presented. This paper focuses on GMSKand PSK-modulation schemes, which are used in digital mobile radio systems (DCSlSOO, GSM, DECT) as well as in digital audio broadcast systems (DAB). An analysis of the performance of the different modulation schemes in difficult terrain is shown.	algorithm;computation;digital enhanced cordless telecommunications;elegant degradation;family computer disk system;interference (communication);modulation;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;pre-shared key;software propagation;x.690	Thomas Kürner;Dieter J.

In particular, noncoherent approaches based on decision-feedback equalization (DFE) are presented and assessed. On the one hand, sorted decision-feedback differential detection (DFDD) is attractive for the detection of a particular user over a transmission burst. On the other hand, noncoherent DFE (nDFE) over the users, purely based on statistical channel knowledge, is rewarding. Up to now, DFDD has been used inside the nDFE scheme; the transmission bursts of the users are detected in sequence and the sortings of nDFE and DFDD are optimized individually. In this paper, we present a noncoherent detection scheme where joint user/temporal sorting is carried out. The suited choice of the receive windowing is discussed. Numerical results quantifying the performance gains over stateof-the-art noncoherent schemes and coherent BLAST, taking the non-perfect channel knowledge due to finite-length training sequences into account, are presented.	blast;channel state information;coherence (physics);computation;computational complexity theory;concatenation;feedback;forward error correction;iteration;marginal model;microsoft windows;multi-user mimo;numerical method;sorting;telecommunications link	Robert F.

The error probability for such a system depends on the spreading sequence, the autocorrelation function of the fading process, the received signal-to-noise ratio, and the number of taps in the Rake receiver. The focus of the paper is on the effect of the spreading sequence on the performance of each of two systems. One system employs noncoherent detection of differentially-encoded binary direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals and a post-detection diversity-combining Rake receiver which uses equal-gain combining. The other system employs coherent detection of binary direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals and a post-detection diversity-combining Rake receiver with perfect gain estimates for the channel. A simple sequence selection criterion is introduced, and the sensitivity of the performance of the system to the choice of the spreading sequence is examined. It is shown that significant performance differences result from different choices of the spreading sequence. It is also shown that, given a moderate range of delay spreads, sequences can be found that yield low bit error probabilities over that range. These are found to be robust with respect to the delay spectrum for the channel, the number of taps in the Rake receiver, the Doppler spread, and the signal-to-noise ratio.	rake	Daniel L.

2f1ad0a1bfb8867f01b8a4df463e71a4532e39a0	clipping noise-aided message passing algorithm for scma-ofdm system		Sparse code multiple access combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SCMA-OFDM) is a promising wireless air-interface technology for fifth generation (5G) networks to support massive connections. The existing problem for SCMA-OFDM system is that the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is unbearable high. The clipping method is often adopted to reduce the PAPR. However, the clipping brings extra noise to the SCMA-OFDM system. Due to the conventional message passing algorithm (C-MPA) didn’t consider the clipping noise, it will cause the C-MPA decoding to be inaccurate and degrade the bit error rate performance. To tackle this issue, a novel clipping noise-aided MPA scheme, named CNA-MPA, which take both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the clipping noise into consideration for decoding accurately is proposed. Simulation results show that the analysis of the clipping noise is accurate and the proposed CNA-MPA scheme leveraging both the AWGN and clipping noise can handle the phenomenon of the performance deterioration occurred in the C-MPA scheme at high Eb/N0 regime.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bit error rate;clipping (computer graphics);eb/n0;fifth generation computer;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;message passing;multiplexing;netware;neural coding;power architecture platform reference;requirement;simulation;sparse;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lin Yang;Xubin Lin;Xinying Ma;Kun Song	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2864265	bit error rate;message passing;real-time computing;additive white gaussian noise;computer science;decoding methods;clipping (audio);algorithm;phenomenon;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	HPC	46.199069970799265	79.73827360437126	198688

Albeit this is achieved at the cost of requiring an increased transmit power, they are particularly beneficial, for example in cooperative communication scenarios, where the employment of channel estimation for all the mobile-to-mobile links may become unrealistic. In pursuit of high bandwidth efficiency, differential amplitude and phase shift keying (DAPSK) was devised using constellations of multiple concentric rings. In order to increase resilience against the typical high-Doppler-induced performance degradation of DAPSK and/or enhance the maximum achievable error-free transmission rate for DAPSK modulated systems, multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) may be invoked. However, the complexity of the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) MSDD increases exponentially with the detection window size and hence may become excessive upon increasing the window size, especially in the context of iterative detection aided channel coded system. In order to circumvent this excessive complexity, we conceive a decomposed two-stage iterative amplitude and phase (A/P) detection framework, where the challenge of having a non-constant-modulus constellation is tackled with the aid of a specifically designed information exchange between the independent A/P detection stages, thus allowing the incorporation of reduced-complexity sphere detection (SD). Consequently, a near-MAP-MSDD performance can be achieved at a significantly reduced complexity, which may be five orders of magnitude lower than that imposed by the traditional MAP-MSDD in the 16-DAPSK scenario considered.	channel state information;elegant degradation;information exchange;iteration;iterative method;key (cryptography);modulation;modulus robot;spectral efficiency;transceiver	Li Wang;K.

Mutual coupling not only affects the signal through correlation but also the thermal noise-a critical factor omitted from previous work. We study a two-antenna array by applying the Nyquist's thermal noise theorem. Simulation results shows that mean MIMO channel capacity is underestimated if the noise correlation due to mutual coupling effect is not accounted for. We present results for both cases when the transmitter does and does not know the channel realizations	channel capacity;johnson–nyquist noise;mimo;mutual exclusion;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;simulation;transmitter	Snezana Krusevac;Predrag B.

It is able to provide excellent performance comparing to the conventional turbo coded modulation schemes. In this paper, we consider the design of the PCM schemes with high modulation order, e.g., 256QAM or 1024QAM etc. Different with the legacy PCM of low modulation order, the coded bits in high-order PCM with all-zero frozen-sequence will demonstrate obvious correlations which lead to catastrophic performance loss. In order to evaluate this loss, we introduce a quantitative metric, named the bit conditional mutual information (BCMI), to analyze the correlation. Then a new PCM scheme based on the constrained frozen-sequence is proposed to eliminate the correlations among the coded bits. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can ensure the performance of PCM and significantly outperform that of the turbo coded modulation schemes.	compaq lte;conditional mutual information;modulation;simulation;spectral efficiency	Jincheng Dai;Kai Niu;Jiaru Lin	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292223	real-time computing;quadrature amplitude modulation;modulation;conditional mutual information;electronic engineering;computer science;polar;modulation order;spectral efficiency	Arch	44.81617083042234	80.51822936670258	199119
c510b3b891881ee06f9ce7539d612757f4f7158e	analysis and simulations of mmw transceiver for system-in-package communications		This paper uses an analytical approach to provide a performance analysis of a millimeter-wave short-range link for System in Package (SiP) applications. Thanks to an analytical modeling of the real Si-integrated antenna, an easy-to-use expression of the Intersymbol Interference (ISI) is derived and used to estimate the performance of the communication system. The performance of two different low-complexity binary constellations (bipolar and unipolar symbols) and four different pulse shapes, i.e., No-Return-to-Zero (NRZ), Return-to-Zero (RZ), Manchester (MAN) and Root-Raised-Cosine (RRC) are compared to highlight the different performance in relation to the tight area and power constraints.	computer simulation;system in package;transceiver	Sergio Saponara;Gabriele Ciarpi;Filippo Giannetti	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-93082-4_13	intersymbol interference;constellation;communications system;electronic engineering;system in package;transceiver;binary number;computer science	HPC	40.496214464403174	80.01572031006866	199194

The expression involves a single integral with finite limits and finite integrand. A closed-form expression is also derived for the average symbol error probability for binary phase-shift keying.	interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation	Debang Lao;Alexander M.

108a179d5a9d8c4611e5a171d4fbbcf244aa600a	new combining scheme in stbc single carrier block transmission system	frequency selective fading;diversity combine;single carrier frequency domain equalization sc fde;space time block codes stbc	A new diversity combining algorithm is presented in this paper with high performance in the STBC single carrier (SC) block transmission MISO system with two transmit antennas and one receive antenna. The decision on the transmitted signal is made by STBC-based SC frequency domain equalizer (STBC-SC-FDE), and then the line of sight (LOS) component under Rician fading channels or the component with highest power under Rayleigh fading channels in the received signal is obtained by cancelling the multipath signals reconstructed by the initial detecting solution and the channel impulse response (CIR) from the received signal. Then, the LOS or the strongest component is combined using STBC-like combining scheme. The new algorithm can achieve the performance advantages dramatically over STBC-SC-FDE which is verified by computer simulations carried out in the SUI-4 and TU wireless communication link.

Besides considering the standard, we also propose and study system performance enhancements through the application of Turbo and Repeat-Accumulate (RA) codes, as well as OFDM bit-loading. Our methodology consists of (a) a study of the channel model developed under IEEE 802.15 for UWB from a frequency-domain perspective suited for OFDM transmission, (b) development and quantification of appropriate information-theoretic performance measures, (c) comparison of these measures with simulation results for the Multiband OFDM standard proposal as well as our proposed extensions, and (d) the consideration of the influence of practical, imperfect channel estimation on the performance. We find that the current Multiband OFDM standard sufficiently exploits the frequency selectivity of the UWB channel, and that the system performs in the vicinity of the channel cutoff rate. Turbo codes and a reduced-complexity clustered bit-loading algorithm improve the system power efficiency by over 6 dB at a data rate of 480 Mbps.	algorithm;channel (communications);channel state information;data rate units;emoticon;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;information theory;multiplexing;performance per watt;profiling (computer programming);selectivity (electronic);simulation;turbo code;ultra-wideband	Chris Snow;Lutz H.-J.

The data are Reed-Solomon (RS) encoded and then modulate a carrier by means of M-ary frequency-shift-keying (MFSK) The indoor radio channel is described as a multipath (Rayleigh or Rician) slowly fading channel. The receiver uses predetection diversity by linearly combining the squared enveloped of the different hops of the same MFSK symbol. The bit error rate (BER) performane is evaluated, and how the performance is influenced by various parameters, such as the number of hops per symbol, the size of the symbol alphabet, the ratio of specular power to fading power, and the ratio of nonreference user power to reference user power, is investigated. >	modulation	Jiangzhou Wang;Marc Moeneclaey	1993	IEEE Trans.
