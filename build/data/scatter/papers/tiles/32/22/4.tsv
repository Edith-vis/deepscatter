87422f5d4f994b80ac84aa147d289cbcb9703b03	three-dimensional reconstruction of the bronchial tree in volumetric computerized tomography: application to computerized tomography bronchography	3d modeling;laser marking;lung;computerized tomography;three dimensional reconstruction;tomography;radiometric corrections;diseases and disorders	We present a new method for computerized tomography (CT)-based investigation of pulmonary airways. The developed approach is based on a fully automated 3-D reconstruction of the bronchial tree from volumetric spiral CT data. The 3-D reconstruction procedure combines mathematical morphology-based 2-D segmentation, performed on axial images, together with 3-D topology-based restoration and filtering. The 3-D bronchial tree is reconstructed up to the sixth subdivision order and is investigated by using a volume-rendering technique, where bronchi voxels are assigned the gray-level value of their projection in the original CT images. Such a visualization modality, referred to as CT bronchography, provides radiologists with a perception of the sole 3-D bronchial tree structure and preserves the original data contrast. Tested on a data set corresponding to 20 clinical examinations, the proposed method shows robustness with respect to various pathologies such as stenosis, bronchiectasis, mucoid impactions, and infiltrative diseases. It emphasizes the interest in considering CT bronchography as a complementary tool for clinical diagnosis and follow-up of airway diseases.	ct scan;tomography	Catalin I. Fetita;Françoise J.

The task is, however, quite challenging, especially for 3D objects, because suspicious ROIs are usually soft-tissue structures, which include a various organs and anatomical objects while sharing a small intensity dynamic range in CT images. Furthermore, the ROIs usually vary significantly in size, shape, and boundary conditions. Among considerable efforts contributed to addressing the problem, live wire, also known as intelligent scissors, has been recognized as an efficient and robust tool for dealing with a wide range of 2D ROIs. Such an approach provides full user control during the process while minimizing human interaction to optimally counterbalance automatic and manual approaches. In this work, we improve our previous live-wire-based segmentation of 3D objects and the experiment results show its efficiency and robustness.	boundary case;ct scan;counterbalance device component;dynamic range;organ;physical object;region of interest;semiconductor industry;user interface;biologic segmentation	Kongkuo Lu;Zhong Xue;Stephen T.

A novel level-set segmentation process is developed that simultaneously delineates and tracks the boundaries of the left ventricle muscle. By encoding prior knowledge about cardiac temporal evolution in a parametric framework, an expectation-maximization algorithm optimally tracks the myocardial deformation over the cardiac cycle. The expectation step deforms the level-set function while the maximization step updates the prior temporal model parameters to perform the segmentation in a nonrigid sense.	coherence (physics);expectation–maximization algorithm;heart ventricle;hypoplastic left heart syndrome;left ventricular structure;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;muscle;myocardium;segmentation action;biologic segmentation	Michael Lynch;Ovidiu Ghita;Paul F.

(restauration and shape recognition inside images with poisson noise: application tothe analysis of neurons acquired by fluorescence microscopy)		While studying the brain, biologists and doctors focus on some small protrusions on the dendrites which go by the name of dendritic spines. These spines play an important role in the synaptic transmission process. They are observed using a fluorescent confocal microscope. Observed images are hard to exploit because 1) they are degraded by diffractionrelated blur and noise, 2) they present a large morphological diversity and 3) one dendrite may show an important density of spines. This thesis is then divided into three parts : the first part presents a theoretical optimization framework that is then applied to deconvolution under Poisson noise. The second part considers shape comparison using morphological information by graph kernels. The third part proposes a framework that deploys the image analysis tools developed in the previous chapters to get automatically morphological information about the observed spines.

Unfortunately, existing methods for segmenting spinal images are still limited to one specific structure, in one specific plane or from one specific modality (S(3)). In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Regression Segmentation, that is for the first time able to segment M(3) spinal images in one single unified framework. This approach formulates the segmentation task innovatively as a boundary regression problem: modeling a highly nonlinear mapping function from substantially diverse M(3) images directly to desired object boundaries. Leveraging the advancement of sparse kernel machines, regression segmentation is fulfilled by a multi-dimensional support vector regressor (MSVR) which operates in an implicit, high dimensional feature space where M(3) diversity and specificity can be systematically categorized, extracted, and handled. The proposed regression segmentation approach was thoroughly tested on images from 113 clinical subjects including both disc and vertebral structures, in both sagittal and axial planes, and from both MRI and CT modalities. The overall result reaches a high dice similarity index (DSI) 0.912 and a low boundary distance (BD) 0.928 mm. With our unified and expendable framework, an efficient clinical tool for M(3) spinal image segmentation can be easily achieved, and will substantially benefit the diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases.

Histology slices are first scanned into computer as a sequence of image files with a histology film scanner. An initial 3D alignment of the images is obtained through the histological similarity matching between neighboring slices. Further optimization is achieved by applying optimal affine transformation to each slice according to feature curve smoothing. Considering the intrinsic smoothness of the physical features, we compute the transformation to refine the selected features based on NURBS splines. Consequently, volume reconstruction is further optimized. We also present new evaluation methods to prove that our reconstruction scheme can achieve a high accuracy.	film scanner;intrinsic dimension;mathematical optimization;non-uniform rational b-spline;programming paradigm;smoothing;spline (mathematics);usability	Yunhao Tan;Jing Hua;Ming Dong	2007	2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2007.356952	iterative reconstruction;spline;computer vision;index term;radiology;surface reconstruction;feature extraction;computer science;pattern recognition;sequence;affine transformation;mathematics;data visualization;computer graphics (images)	Vision	45.73655519629988	-77.25797207184208	178839

In this paper, we propose the use of phase congruency as a more robust detection method, as it is based on a multiscale intensity-invariant measure. We show the application of phase congruency for the detection of cortical sulci from T2 weighted MRI. Sulci represent important landmarks in the structural analysis of the brain, as their location and orientation provide valuable information for diagnosis and surgical planning. Results show that phase congruency outperforms previous techniques, even in the presence of intensity bias fields due to magnetic field inhomogeneity.	feature detection (computer vision);gradient;phase congruency;structural analysis	Marius George Linguraru;Miguel Ángel González Ballester;Nicholas Ayache	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39903-2_90	computer vision;magnetic field;morphological analysis;computer science;invariant measure;artificial intelligence;feature detection;mathematics;structural analysis	Vision	42.2132933160603	-77.79235827753149	178869

The intensity in homogeneity correction and MR intensity standardization techniques are used first to make the MR image intensities have a tissue-specific meaning. The mean intensity vector and covariance matrix of each brain tissue are then estimated and fixed. Vectorial scale-based fuzzy connectedness and certain morphological operations are utilized to geernate the brain intracranial mask. The fuzzy membership value of each voxel for each brain tissue is then estimated within the intracranial mask via a multivariate Gaussian model. Finally, a maximum likelihood criterion with spatial constraints taken into account is utilized in classifying all voxels in the intracranial mask into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. This method has been tested on 10 clinical MR data sets. These tests and a comparison with the method of C-means and fuzzy C-means clustering indicated the effectiveness of the method.© (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

5036be4c7ad13dea56734f16bcfcf55efdc12350	visual comparison of 3d medical image segmentation algorithms based on statistical shape models		3D medical image segmentation is needed for diagnosis and treatment. As manual segmentation is very costly, automatic segmentation algorithms are needed. For finding best algorithms, several algorithms need to be evaluated on a set of organ instances. This is currently difficult due to dataset size and complexity. In this paper, we present a novel method for comparison and evaluation of several algorithms that automatically segment 3D medical images. It combines algorithmic data analysis with interactive data visualization. A clustering algorithm identifies regions of common quality across the segmented data set for each algorithm. The comparison identifies best algorithms per region. Interactive views show the algorithm quality. We applied our approach to a real-world cochlea dataset, which was segmented with several algorithms. Our approach allowed segmentation experts to compare algorithms on regional level and to identify best algorithms per region.	algorithm;cluster analysis;image segmentation;interactive data visualization;scalability;visual comparison	Alexander C Geurts;Georgios Sakas;Arjan Kuijper;Meike Becker;Tatiana von Landesberger	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21070-4_34	computer vision;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	39.96721518098133	-77.3583808384684	179413

Blood Vessel edge detection in retinal images is very important in medical image processing. A lot of algorithms have been suggested for extracting medical image edges, and however, obtaining continuous edges with less over-detection points is difficult for edge extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for blood vessel edge detection by integrating wavelet with fractal. First, accurate edges are extracted by employing wavelet technique. Then, continuous edges are obtained based on fractal technique.

Since the endoscope is usually guided by free-hand, it is difficult to ensure a sequence of seamless frame transitions. Also 2-D panoramic images showing an extended field of view (FOV) do not provide always reliable results, since their interpretations are limited by potentially strong geometric distortions. To overcome these limitations and provide a direct verification method, we develop a gap detection algorithm using graphs. Exploiting the motion information of the applied zig-zag scan, we construct a graph representation of the video sequence. Without any explicit global image visualization our graph search algorithm identifies reliably frame discontinuities, which would lead to holes and slit artifacts in a panoramic view. The algorithm shows high detection rates and provides a fast method to verify frame discontinuities in the whole video sequence. Missed regions are highlighted by local image compositions which can be displayed during the intervention for assistance and inspection control.	composition;distortion;endoscope device component;endoscopes;field of view in video games;frame (physical object);graph (abstract data type);graph - visual representation;graph traversal;imagery;interpretation process;morphologic artifacts;organ;robustness (computer science);seamless3d;search algorithm;urinary bladder;verification of theories	Alexander Behrens;Masato Takami;Sebastian Gross;Til Aach	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091636	computer vision;simulation;visualization;edge detection;inspection;field of view;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;signal processing;graph;robustness	Vision	42.41714412712127	-74.68636873933978	180511

This measure parallels the well known Shannon entropy but has the following advantages: (1) it is more general than the Shannon Entropy as its definition is valid in the discrete and continuous domains, (2) it possess more general mathematical properties and (3) it can be easily computed from sample data and these computations asymptotically converge to the true values. Based on CRE, we define the cross-CRE (CCRE) between two random variables, and apply it to solve the image alignment problem for parameterized (3D rigid and affine) transformations. The key strengths of the CCRE over using the mutual information (based on Shannon's entropy) are that the former has significantly larger tolerance to noise and a much larger convergence range over the field of parameterized transformations. We demonstrate these strengths via experiments on synthesized and real image data.	alignment;block nested loop;computation;converge;crisscross heart;cross-validation (statistics);cumulative trauma disorders;diffusion weighted imaging;entropy (information theory);experiment;feature learning;jamie wilkinson;large;mathematics;modality (human–computer interaction);motion;muscle rigidity;mutual information;national center for research resources;neuroscience discipline;non-maskable interrupt;numerous;parallels desktop for mac;probability density;science of neurosurgery;shannon (unit);synthetic data;theory;united states national institutes of health;whole earth 'lectronic link;cell transformation	Fei Wang;Baba C.

In general, the matching between control points is unknown, however. An automated algorithm is used to determine the matching pairs of control points in the two images as follows. Using two control points from each image, rigid global transform (RGT) coefficients were calculated for all possible combinations of control point pairs. The set of RGT coefficients was then exhaustively searched and the cluster of coefficients associated with the matched control point pairs identified. This cluster was identified by calculating the Euclidean distance between each set of RGT coefficients and its Rth nearest neighbor and then using the EM algorithm to identify matched pairs of control points. Once control point pairs were established, registration of the two images was achieved by using linear regression to optimize the bilinear or 2nd order polynomial. Two examples of registration are shown. The first is an example of cross-modal image registration using an optical image and a fluorescein angiogram of an eye. The second examples shows an example of the registration of two images of an infant eye captured thirteen days apart.	control point (mathematics);image registration	Conor Heneghan;P.

In this paper, we propose a new adaptive method for the automatic segmentation of the optic disk in digital color fundus images, using mathematical morphology. The proposed method has been designed to be robust under varying illumination and image acquisition conditions, common in eye fundus imaging. Our experimental results based on two publicly available eye fundus image databases are encouraging, and indicate that our approach potentially can achieve a better performance than other known methods proposed in the literature. Using the DRIVE database (which consists of 40 retinal images), our method achieves a success rate of 100% in the correct location of the optic disk, with 41.47% of mean overlap. In the DIARETDB1 database (which consists of 89 retinal images), the optic disk is correctly located in 97.75% of the images, with a mean overlap of 43.65%.	blood vessel;cerebrovascular disorders;computation;database;diabetes mellitus;eighty nine;excretory function;experiment;eye color;galaxy morphological classification;hemorrhage;locus;mad;mathematical morphology;mathematics;mean squared error;morphologic artifacts;optic disk;performance tuning;population parameter;preprocessor;retina;retinal diseases;smoothing (statistical technique);structure of fovea centralis;structure of fundus of eye;benefit;biologic segmentation	Daniel Welfer;Jacob Scharcanski;Cleyson M.

f8937c2e245522ad3275e5b2954d8db0e540fed4	local neuron radius estimation in volumetric microscopy images		Accurate estimation of local neuron size of complex 3D neuron structures imaged by microscopy is very important for quantification of neuronal morphology, such as neuron tracing applications. Previously, the Rayburst sampling algorithm was developed to estimate the neuron size in volumetric microscopy images. However, it requires an accurate detection of the neuron centerline, which is not easy and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose to estimate the neuron local radius of any region of interest in a given neuron, by first detecting its corresponding neuron centerline point using Multistencils Fast Marching (MSFM) method and then estimating the local neuron radius by the Rayburst sampling algorithm. The experimental results on different datasets show that the proposed method could obtain very accurate local neuron radius efficiently.	algorithm;fast fourier transform;mathematical morphology;neuron;region of interest;sampling (signal processing);sensor	Min Liu;Keran Liu;Chao Wang;Huiqiong Luo	2018	2018 25th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2018.8451155	computer vision;region of interest;computer science;fast marching method;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;microscopy;neuron	Vision	41.24578703144244	-74.75766507701563	181881

This method is based on a multi-class discrete deformable model strategy, starting from a topologically correct model, and guiding its evolution in a topology-preserving fashion. Validations on a commonly used cerebral image database provide promising results and justify the further development of a general methodological framework based on the concepts exposed in this preliminary work.	analysis of algorithms;computation;computational complexity theory;digital image;image segmentation;resonance;time complexity	Sanae Miri;Nicolas Passat;Jean-Paul Armspach	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69905-7_8	medical imaging;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;segmentation-based object categorization;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation;satisfiability	Vision	43.002183452223065	-74.29111797790513	182101

In this paper, we are interested in the connectivity induced by white matter fibers in the living human brain. Considering the data resolution, this question has to be addressed at the level of fascicles made up by a bunch of parallel fibers. We propose first an algorithm dedicated to the fascicle tracking in a direction map inferred from diffusion data. This algorithm takes into account the usual fan shaped merge of several fascicles in one larger bundle. Then, we propose a way of inferring a regularized direction map from diffusion data in order to get a robust tracking. The regularization stems from a priori knowledge on the white matter geometry embedded in a model of the bending energy of an equivalent spaghetti plate. Finally, we propose a study of the tracking behaviour according to the weight given to the regularization and some examples of the tracking results with real data.		Cyril Poupon;Christopher A.

In this paper, a new automatic algorithm for lesion segmentation based on the multi-channel MR images (T1w, T2w and FLAIR image) is proposed, which utilizes the unique and complementary intensity information of multi-channel MR images. In this method, the observed multi-channel MR images are modeled as a vector valued image. The image in each channel consists of two multiplicative components: a smooth varying bias filed vector and a piecewise approximately constant true image vector. An energy function of this vector valued image is defined in term of the property of true image and bias field. The energy minimization is proposed for seeking the optimal segmentation result of lesions. Our method is applied to the real multi-channel MR images and compared with two sets of manual segmentation followed by the quantitative evaluation. The experimental results show that our approach is effective and robust for the lesion segmentation.	acronis true image;algorithm;energy minimization;feature vector;image registration;mathematical optimization;preprocessor	Jingjing Gao;Chunming Li	2013	2013 Seventh International Conference on Image and Graphics	10.1109/ICIG.2013.182	computer vision;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;segmentation-based object categorization;mathematics;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation;energy minimization;neurophysiology	Vision	44.23804452992842	-80.12954571075406	182752

In this paper, we apply our approach to the analysis of vessels in 2D X-ray angiography and 3D X-ray rotational angiography of the brain. Other variational methods proposed in the literature encode the medial structure of vessel trees as a skeleton with associated vessel radii. In contrast, our method provides a dense smooth level set map which sign provides the segmentation. The ridges of this map define the segmented regions skeleton. The differential structure of the smooth map (in particular the Hessian) allows the discrimination between tubular and other structures. In 3D, both circular and non-circular tubular cross-sections and tubular branching can be handled conveniently. This algorithm allows accurate segmentation of complex vessel structures. It also provides key tools for extracting anatomically labeled vessel tree graphs and for dealing with challenging issues like kissing vessel discrimination and separation of entangled 3D vessel trees.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;calculus of variations;encode;hessian;image segmentation;medial graph;rotational angiography;site map	Shérif Makram-Ebeid;Jean Stawiaski;Guillaume Pizaine	2011		10.1117/12.878126	computer vision;mathematical optimization;variational method;level set;finite element method;cross section;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	45.45200110436014	-75.63463841295209	183514

This paper presents a novel algorithm for automated segmentation of lungs based on modified convex hull algorithm and mathematical morphology techniques. Sixty randomly selected lung HRCT scans with different abnormalities are used to test the proposed algorithm, and experimental results show that the proposed approach can accurately segment the lungs even in the presence of disease patterns, with some limitations in the apices and bases of lungs. The algorithm demonstrates a high segmentation accuracy (dice similarity coefficient = 98.62 and shape differentiation metrics dmean = 1.39 mm, and drms = 2.76 mm). Therefore, the developed automated lung segmentation algorithm is a good candidate for the first stage of a computer-aided diagnosis system for diffuse lung diseases.	base;ct scan;coefficient;computer assisted diagnosis;congenital abnormality;convex hull;high-resolution computed tomography;image resolution;lung diseases;mathematical morphology;randomness;segmentation action;stage level 1;structure of parenchyma of lung;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Ammi Reddy Pulagam;Giri Babu Kande;Venkata Krishna Rao Ede;Ramesh Babu Inampudi	2016	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-016-9875-z	text mining;medical research;medicine;pathology;computer science;bioinformatics;data mining	Vision	39.44854045674276	-78.54889012768336	183554

Digital image processing enables rapid and consistent quantification of qualitative observations. The image processing model examined here provides a tool for the biologists to identify structures called retraction fibers (RF) that are formed during Epithelial-Mesenchyme Transition (EMT), an important developmental process which also occurs during cancer metastasis. Quantifying RF formation is an important tool for biologists studying cellular regulation of EMT. The dynamic EMT process is captured using time-lapse microscopy. We use computer vision algorithms to detect and track the RF in image sequences of cells undergoing EMT to generate statistical information such as the number of RF formed during a window, lifetime of the RF, and their geometric dimension. This information can in turn be used by the biologist to quantitatively measure the extent of EMT under different test conditions.	algorithm;automatic identification and data capture;computer vision;digital image processing;fiber (computer science);optical fiber;radio frequency	Meher T.

These dynamic events are critical for studying cellular processes such as the cancer drug effectiveness study. Typically, these events are quantified by imaging microtubule movements over time, which results in large data sets that require rigorous quantitative analysis. In most cases, the analysis was performed manually by the researcher. This process is tedious and prone to error and becomes a bottleneck in modern cancer research. Thus, an efficient, reliable, and rapid quantification method is in critical need. In this paper, we describe open contour-based tracking methods to automatically segment and track microtubule movements. We redefine the internal energy terms specifically for open snake, and examine different external energy terms for locating the end points of a microtubule. This algorithm has been validated using simulated images, untreated MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, and cells treated with the microtubule-targeting chemotherapeutic agent, Taxol.	algorithm;bottleneck (engineering);communication endpoint	Koon Yin Kong;Adam I.

cc83a215b75915d044cd6b06e2dfee839388f21a	semi-automated extraction of crohns disease mr imaging markers using a 3d residual cnn with distance prior		We propose a 3D residual convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with an integrated distance prior for segmenting the small bowel lumen and wall to enable extraction of pediatric Crohns disease (pCD) imaging markers from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MR images. Our proposed segmentation framework enables, for the first time, to quantitatively assess luminal narrowing and dilation in CD aimed at optimizing surgical decisions as well as analyzing bowel wall thickness and tissue enhancement for assessment of response to therapy. Given seed points along the bowel lumen, the proposed algorithm automatically extracts 3D image patches centered on these points and a distance map from the interpolated centerline. These 3D patches and corresponding distance map are jointly used by the proposed residual CNN architecture to segment the lumen and the wall, and to extract imaging markers. Due to lack of available training data, we also propose a novel and efficient semi-automated segmentation algorithm based on graph-cuts technique as well as a software tool for quickly editing labeled data that was used to train our proposed CNN model. The method which is based on curved planar reformation of the small bowel is also useful for visualizing, manually refining, and measuring pCD imaging markers. In preliminary experiments, our CNN network obtained Dice coefficients of 75 ± 18%, 81 ± 8% and 97 ± 2% for the lumen, wall and background, respectively.	artificial neural network;biological neural networks;coefficient;convolutional neural network;cut (graph theory);dilation (morphology);distance transform;experiment;incised wound;interpolation;intestines;intestines, small;pathological dilatation;pediatric crohn's disease;phenobarbital;programming tool;semiconductor industry;small intestinal wall tissue;structure of lumen of body system;thickness (graph theory);tracer;units of measure - lumen;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Yechiel Lamash;Sila Kurugol;Simon K.

We show using such a geometrical constraint helps to significantly reduce user interaction and improve the accuracy of segmentation results at the same time. We solve the proposed multiregion segmentation problem with the order constraints by means of convex optimization, resulting in a fast and reliable flow maximization approach which implicitly embeds the linear order prior without introducing extra computation load. In this regard, a new fully parallelized continuous max-flow algorithm is proposed and implemented using GPGPU to segment a 3D volume within one second. We demonstrate our results over pathological trans-esophageal echocardiogram, cardiac CT and delayed enhancement MRI data sets.	algorithm;ct scan;computation;computed tomography of the heart;convex optimization;dvd region code;entropy maximization;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;image segmentation;mathematical optimization;maximum flow problem;modality (human–computer interaction);parallel computing;source-to-source compiler	Martin Rajchl;Jing Yuan;Eranga Ukwatta;Terry M.

Methods: Preoperative virtual planning for this type of surgery has been performed by manual adjustment of many parameters, or based upon a single feature of the reconstruction. We propose a novel planning procedure formulated as a nonconvex minimization problem of an objective function using the multilateral shape descriptors. Results: A retrospective study was designed and 120 reconstruction plans were reproduced using computed tomography images with oral surgeons. The proposed automated planning model was quantitatively compared with both the existing model and the surgeons’ plans. Conclusion: The results show that the developed framework attains stable automated planning that agrees with the surgeons’ decisions. Significance: This method addresses tradeoff problems between symmetric reconstruction and restoration of the native contour of the mandible.

This method has two levels, the first one is an iterative algorithm based on the minimization of an objective function. The density is introduced in this objective function where the distances between points become relatively uniform in high dimensional spaces. In such cases, the density of cluster may give better results. The idea of the second level is to find the clusters in each subspace individually. We applied the proposed method to medical tomography scan image without Intravenous or IV contrast dye. Then we compare the results with the same image with IV contrast. However in some cases, there are risks associated with this injection, where the mortality risk is low but not null. This method can reduce the use of this injection. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method gives good results in medical tomography image.	algorithm;cluster analysis;clustering high-dimensional data;embedded system;iterative method;loss function;optimization problem;synthetic intelligence;tomography	Amel Boulemnadjel;Fella Hachouf	2012	2012 3rd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)	10.1109/IPTA.2012.6469519	computer vision;minimisation;mathematical optimization;machine learning;mathematics;iterative method;statistics	EDA	43.7125934652767	-74.24770955155998	185634
fd2c896e5c0f21f75003322ff6f5116bd0105e92	symba: diffeomorphic registration based on gradient orientation alignment and boundary proximity of sparsely selected voxels		We propose a novel non-linear registration strategy which seeks an optimal deformation that maps corresponding boundaries of similar orientation. Our approach relies on a local similarity metric based on gradient orientation alignment and distance to the nearest inferred boundary and is evaluated on a reduced set of locations corresponding to inferred boundaries. The deformation model is characterized as the in- tegration of a time-constant velocity field and optimization is performed in coarse to fine multi-level strategy with a gradient ascent technique. Our approach is computational efficient since it relies on a sparse se- lection of voxels corresponding to detected boundaries, yielding robust and accurate results with reduced processing times. We demonstrate quantitative results in the context of the non-linear registration of inter- patient magnetic resonance brain volumes obtained from a public dataset (CUMC12). Our proposed approach achieves a similar level of accuracy as other state-of-the-art methods but with processing times as short as 1.5 minutes. We also demonstrate preliminary qualitative results in the time-sensitive registration contexts of registering MR brain volumes to intra-operative ultrasound for improved guidance in neurosurgery.	gradient descent;voxel	Dante De Nigris;D.

This paper presents a template based approach with multi-expert refinement to automatic rodent brain extraction. We first build the brain appearance model based on the learning exemplars. Together with the template matching, we encode the rodent brain position into the search space to reliably locate the rodent brain and estimate the rough segmentation. With the initial mask, a level-set segmentation and a mask-based template learning are implemented further to the brain region. The multi-expert fusion is used to generate a new mask. We finally combine the region growing based on the histogram distribution learning to delineate the final brain mask. A high-resolution rodent atlas is used to illustrate that the segmented low resolution anatomic image can be well mapped to the atlas. Tested on a public data set, all brains are located reliably and we achieve the mean Jaccard similarity score at 94.99% for brain segmentation, which is a statistically significant improvement compared to two other rodent brain extraction methods.	atlas autocode;atlases;cervical atlas;clinical use template;encode;genetic translation process;image resolution;information privacy;jaccard index;numerous;refinement (computing);region growing;rough set;segmentation action;silo (dataset);template matching;biologic segmentation;brain segmentation	Weimin Huang;Jiaqi Zhang;Zhiping Lin;Su Huang;Yuping Duan;Zhongkang Lu	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591619	computer vision;radiology;medicine;shape;computer science;artificial intelligence;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;mathematics;image segmentation	Vision	42.37168523208355	-77.99531382796124	186053

One computational tool of particular interest in the analysis of MR images of the cerebral cortex has been the automatic extraction of surfaces. Recently, enhanced MR images have been produced whose quality presented the opportunity to extract several of these surfaces from the same volume. We present preliminary data using this approach to visualize the boundaries of the cortex from the dura to the white matter. A series of isosurfaces were extracted from a signM-enhanced T1 MRI. The lower MR-intensity isosurfaces featured cortical vessels and dura, in contrast to higher intensity isosurfaces, in which the deeper structure of the superficial gyri became apparent. Two surfaces were chosen, one representative of the outer cortical surface and the other of the inner grey/white boundary, and their separation was computed to construct a """"cortical thickness map.""""

We propose a new multi-label local ranking strategy for template selection based on the locally normalised cross correlation (LNCC) and an extension to the classical STAPLE algorithm by Warfield et al. [15]. It addresses the known problem of local vs. global image matching and the bias introduced in the performance estimation due to structure size. Results show a significant improvement in terms of segmentation accuracy for key brain areas when compared to state-of-the-art brain parcelation algorithms and reduced discontinuity and fragmentation between structures due to the MRF derived smoothness.	algorithm;ct scan;cross-correlation;fragmentation (computing);image registration;iterative method;markov random field;medical imaging;multi-label classification;propagation of uncertainty;reflections of signals on conducting lines;region of interest;software propagation	Manuel Jorge Cardoso;Marc Modat;Sébastien Ourselin;Shiva Keihaninejad;David M.

The GGM consists of a fixed number of vertices that can be registered non-linearly to an individual anatomy so that for each individual we have a clearly defined set of landmarks that is spread across the cortex. This allows us to obtain a regionalized estimation of intersubject variability. Since the GGM is stratified into different levels of depth, it also allows us to estimate variability as a function of depth. As another application of a polygonal line representation underlying the generic gyral model, we present a cortical parcellation scheme that can be used to regionalize cortical measurements.	anatomic structures;generic drugs;generic group model;heart rate variability;inter-rater reliability;registration;spatial variability	Gabriele Lohmann;D.

In this article, we present a new fully automated approach for accurate, robust, and efficient lung separation using 3-D CT scans. Our method follows a hysteresis setting that utilizes information from both lung regions and background gaps. First, original segmentation is separated by subtracting the gaps between left and right lungs, which are enhanced with Hessian filtering. Second, the 2-D separation manifold in 3-D image space is estimated based on the distance information from the two subsets. Finally, the separation manifold is projected back to the original segmentation in order to produce the separated lungs through optimization for addressing minor local variations. An evaluation on over 400 human and 100 small animal 3-D CT images with various abnormalities is performed. The proposed scheme successfully separated all connections on the candidate CT images. Using hysteresis mechanism, each phase is performed robustly and 3-D information is utilized to achieve a generic, efficient, and accurate solution.	behavior;ct scan;computation (action);computer-aided design;congenital abnormality;distance transform;generic drugs;handling (psychology);hessian;hysteresis;lung diseases;mathematical optimization;projections and predictions;quantitation;radiology;scanning;segmentation action;short;shortest path problem;structure of parenchyma of lung;biologic segmentation;manifold	Ziyue Xu;Ulas Bagci;Colleen B Jonsson;Sanjay Jain;Daniel J.

Segmentation of the CA from X-ray angiograms is a very challenging problem due to the changes in contrast in the sequence in addition to the CA's complex topology. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical segmentation method that extends the Vessel Walker model using a temporal prior and multiscale information to extract CA with a higher level of accuracy. In this method, the vessel located in frame It at time t is extracted by utilizing the segmentation result at frame It-1 together with Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features and a shape matching technique.

MDB is the minimum distance between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer and the Optic Nerve Head (ONH) surface. It is an effective biomarker for early detection of glaucoma. Our proposed method is the first automatic method for computing the Minimum Distance Band (MDB). This method uses the approximate location of three benchmark reference (TBMR) layers of the retina that help to reduce the search space. This approach is highly accurate in detecting the boundary layers even in the presence of pathology. The terminal points of the RPE serve as the ONH region. The accuracies of ONH and MDB are tested against 13 manually graded optic disc centred SD-OCT volumes (11 B-scan per volume) of Glaucoma patients as a gold standard. Our method is very effective with mean and standard deviation of the error of the ONH width and MDB of 5.36±5.55 and 14.96±17.75 respectively. The precision, recall and F1 score for the ONH region are 94.90, 98.14 and 96.49 respectively.	algorithmic trading;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);ct scan;color gradient;f1 score;mathematical optimization;online and offline;pigment;sacral nerve stimulation;sensor;virtual retinal display	Md.

The segmentation is posed as a probabilistic optimization problem in which the optimal time-dependent surface is obtained for the myocardium of the heart in a discrete space of locations built upon simple geometric assumptions. For this purpose, first, the left ventricle is detected by a set of image analysis tools gathered from the literature. Then, the segmentation solution is obtained by the Maximization of the Posterior Marginals for the myocardium location in a Markov Random Field framework which optimally integrates temporal-spatial smoothness with intensity and gradient related features in an unsupervised way by the Maximum Likelihood estimation of the parameters of the field. This scheme provides a flexible and robust segmentation method which has been able to generate results comparable to manually segmented images for some derived cardiac function parameters in a set of 43 patients affected in different degrees by an Acute Myocardial Infarction.	expectation–maximization algorithm;gradient;heart ventricle;image analysis;left ventricular structure;leukemia, myelocytic, acute;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization;myocardial infarction;myocardium;optimization problem;patients;resonance;unsupervised learning;biologic segmentation	Lucilio Cordero-Grande;Gonzalo Vegas-Sánchez-Ferrero;Pablo Casaseca-de-la-Higuera;J.

6c8b25b674d8e95af4ea82b5eb1bbe47c8efc915	manifold learning for density segmentation in high risk mammograms		There is a strong correlation between relative mammographic breast density and the risk of developing breast cancer. As such, accurately modelling the percentage of a mammogram that is dense is a pivotal step in density based risk classification. In this work, a novel method based on manifold learning is used to segment high-risk mammograms into density regions. As such, finer details are present in the segmentations and more accurate measures of breast density are produced. A set of high risk (BI-RADS IV) full field digital mammograms with density annotations obtained from radiologists are used to test the validity of the proposed approach. By exploiting the manifold structure of the input space, segmentations with average accuracy of 87% when compared with radiologists’ segmentations can be obtained. This is an increase of over 12% compared with segmentation in the high-dimensional space.	bi-rads;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;nonlinear system;radiology;semiconductor industry	Harry Strange;Erika R.

These T2*w hypointensities are typically segmented semi-automatically, which is time consuming, associated with a high intra-rater variability and low inter-rater agreement. To address these limitations, we developed a fully automated, unsupervised segmentation method for basal ganglia T2*w hypointensities. This method requires conventional, co-registered T2*w and T1-weighted (T1w) volumes, as well as region-of-interest (ROI) masks for the basal ganglia and adjacent internal capsule generated automatically from T1w MRI. The basal ganglia T2*w hypointensities were then segmented with thresholds derived with an adaptive outlier detection method from respective bivariate T2*w/T1w intensity distributions in each ROI. Artefacts were reduced by filtering connected components in the initial masks based on their standardised T2*w intensity variance. The segmentation method was validated using a custom-built phantom containing mineral deposit models, i.e. gel beads doped with 3 different contrast agents in 7 different concentrations, as well as with MRI data from 98 community-dwelling older subjects in their seventies with a wide range of basal ganglia T2*w hypointensities. The method produced basal ganglia T2*w hypointensity masks that were in substantial volumetric and spatial agreement with those generated by an experienced rater (Jaccard index = 0.62 ± 0.40). These promising results suggest that this method may have use in automatic segmentation of basal ganglia T2*w hypointensities in studies of small vessel disease and ageing.	aging;anomaly detection;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia diseases;bead dosage form;biological markers;bivariate data;connected component (graph theory);contrast media;doping (semiconductor);heart rate variability;inter-rater reliability;internal capsule of brain;jaccard index;magnetic resonance imaging;masks;morphologic artifacts;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;physiologic calcification;region of interest;registration;sample variance;semiconductor industry;vein matching;biologic segmentation	Andreas Glatz;Mark E.

We present a robust framework to build reliable SSMs from a dataset with outliers and incomplete data. Our method is based on Point Distribution Models (PDMs) and makes use of recent advances in sparse optimisation methods to deal with erroneous correspondences. For validation, we apply the proposed approach to a dataset of 43 (including 24 corrupt) CT scans taken during routine clinical practice. We show that our method is able to improve the quality of the skull SSM in terms of generalization ability, specificity, compactness and robustness to missing data in comparison to standard and state-of-the-art algorithms.	algorithm;ct scan;image analysis;mathematical optimization;medical image computing;medical imaging;missing data;sensitivity and specificity;sparse matrix;statistical model	Benjamín Gutiérrez;Diana Mateus;Ehab Shiban;Bernhard Meyer;Jens Lehmberg;Nassir Navab	2014	2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867858	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Vision	46.23501729686827	-76.85661020747014	191444

This approach combines two recent frameworks for elastic functional data analysis and elastic shape analysis. The proposed trajectory registration framework enables matching and averaging to quantify spatio-temporal deformations while taking into account their dynamic specificities. A key ingredient of this framework is a tracking method that optimizes the evolution of curves extracted from sequences of consecutive images to estimate the spatio-temporal deformation fields. Automatic estimation of such deformations including spatial changes (strain) and dynamic temporal changes (phase) was tested on simulated examples and real myocardial trajectories. Experimental results show significant improvements in the spatio-temporal structure of trajectory comparisons and averages using the proposed framework.	functional data analysis;generative model;shape analysis (digital geometry);simulation	Chafik Samir;Sebastian Kurtek;Justin Strait;Shantanu H.

Three brain tissues are of interest: CSF (CerebroSpinal Fluid), GM (Gray Matter), WM (White Matter). Firstly, we de-noise the images using a newly proposed versatile wavelet-based filter, and segment the images with minimum error global thresholding. Subsequently, we combine a spatial-feature-based FCM (Fuzzy CMeans) clustering with 3-D clustering-result-weighted median and average filters, so as to further achieve a locally adaptive enhancement and segmentation. This integrated strategy yields a robust and accurate segmentation, particularly in noisy images. The performance of the proposed method is validated by four indices on MRI brain phantom images and on real MRI images.	algorithm;cluster analysis;fuzzy cognitive map;imaging phantom;resonance;thresholding (image processing);unsupervised learning;wavelet	Jing-Hao Xue;Aleksandra Pizurica;Wilfried Philips;Etienne E.

31eac1ce7ccaa1d4e7d8c7df9c6a56a245b46848	automated tract extraction via atlas based adaptive clustering		Advancements in imaging protocols such as the high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) and in tractography techniques are expected to cause an increase in the tract-based analyses. Statistical analyses over white matter tracts can contribute greatly towards understanding structural mechanisms of the brain since tracts are representative of connectivity pathways. The main challenge with tract-based studies is the extraction of the tracts of interest in a consistent and comparable manner over a large group of individuals without drawing the inclusion and exclusion regions of interest. In this work, we design a framework for automated extraction of white matter tracts. The framework introduces three main components, namely a connectivity based fiber representation, a fiber bundle atlas, and a clustering approach called Adaptive Clustering. The fiber representation relies on the connectivity signatures of fibers to establish an easy correspondence between different subjects. A group-wise clustering of these fibers that are represented by the connectivity signatures is then used to generate a fiber bundle atlas. Finally, Adaptive Clustering incorporates the previously generated clustering atlas as a prior, to cluster the fibers of a new subject automatically. Experiments on the HARDI scans of healthy individuals acquired repeatedly, demonstrate the applicability, reliability and the repeatability of our approach in extracting white matter tracts. By alleviating the seed region selection and the inclusion/exclusion ROI drawing requirements that are usually handled by trained radiologists, the proposed framework expands the range of possible clinical applications and establishes the ability to perform tract-based analyses with large samples.	a fibers;angularjs;atlases;automatic group;cervical atlas;cluster analysis;concentrate dosage form;exclusion;experiment;extraction;protocols documentation;radiology;region of interest;repeatability;requirement;sensitivity and specificity;tissue fiber;tract (literature);type signature;white matter;statistical cluster	Birkan Tunç;William A.

A sparse coding method is used to estimate image similarity measures among images to registered, yielding asymmetric, groupwise image similarity measures for each image to other images in the group. Based on the asymmetric groupwise image similarity measures among different images, a directed graph is built for learning a manifold of images so that a group center image can be identified and each image can be registered to the center image following a directed shortest path which decomposes a large deformation between two images into a series of small and anatomically meaningful deformations. The groupwise image similarity measures are progressively updated, so does the directed graph, facilitating accurate alignment of a group of images following directed shortest paths derived from the dynamic directed graphs. Compared with state of the art graph based registration methods, our method is more robust and able to achieve better registration accuracy.	directed graph;graph theory;image registration;neural coding;shortest path problem;sparse matrix	Zhenyu Tang;Di Jiang;Yong Fan	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556519	database index;computer vision;manifold;computer science;image registration;graph theory;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;accuracy and precision;neural coding;compressed sensing	Vision	42.634184869333566	-76.90852537215994	194423

Differentiating and localizing the spinal cord internal structure (i.e., gray matter vs. white matter) is critical for assessment of therapeutic impacts and determining prognosis of relevant conditions. Fortunately, new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences enable clinical study of the in vivo spinal cord's internal structure. Yet, low contrast-to-noise ratio, artifacts, and imaging distortions have limited the applicability of tissue segmentation techniques pioneered elsewhere in the central nervous system. Additionally, due to the inter-subject variability exhibited on cervical MRI, typical deformable volumetric registrations perform poorly, limiting the applicability of a typical multi-atlas segmentation framework. Thus, to date, no automated algorithms have been presented for the spinal cord's internal structure. Herein, we present a novel slice-based groupwise registration framework for robustly segmenting cervical spinal cord MRI. Specifically, we provide a method for (1) pre-aligning the slice-based atlases into a groupwise-consistent space, (2) constructing a model of spinal cord variability, (3) projecting the target slice into the low-dimensional space using a model-specific registration cost function, and (4) estimating robust segmentation susing geodesically appropriate atlas information. Moreover, the proposed framework provides a natural mechanism for performing atlas selection and initializing the free model parameters in an informed manner. In a cross-validation experiment using 67 MR volumes of the cervical spinal cord, we demonstrate sub-millimetric accuracy, significant quantitative and qualitative improvement over comparable multi-atlas frameworks, and provide insight into the sensitivity of the associated model parameters.	atlases;cns disorder;cervical segment of spinal cord;contrast-to-noise ratio;cross infection;cross-validation (statistics);distortion;estimated;forecast of outcome;gray matter;heart rate variability;loss function;magnetic resonance imaging;morphologic artifacts;neck;nervous system structure;numerous;spatial variability;video-in video-out;white matter;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Andrew J.

65e702b8b4ab00506e5e09dc38e26bdb39df6351	segmentation of branching vascular structures using adaptive subdivision surface fitting	image segmentation;arteries;magnetic resonance imaging;modeling;blood vessels	This paper describes a novel method for segmentation and modeling of branching vessel structures in medical images using adaptive subdivision surfaces fitting. The method starts with a rough initial skeleton model of the vessel structure. A coarse triangular control mesh consisting of hexagonal rings and dedicated bifurcation elements is constructed from this skeleton. Special attention is paid to ensure a topological sound control mesh is created around the bifurcation areas. Then, a smooth tubular surface is obtained from this coarse mesh using a standard subdivision scheme. This subdivision surface is iteratively fitted to the image. During the fitting, the target update locations of the subdivision surface are obtained using a scanline search along the surface normals, finding the maximum gradient magnitude (of the imaging data). In addition to this surface fitting framework, we propose an adaptive mesh refinement scheme. In this step the coarse control mesh topology is updated based on the current segmentation result, enabling adaptation to varying vessel lumen diameters. This enhances the robustness and flexibility of the method and reduces the amount of prior knowledge needed to create the initial skeletal model. The method was applied to publicly available CTA data from the Carotid Bifurcation Algorithm Evaluation Framework resulting in an average dice index of 89.2% with the ground truth. Application of the method to the complex vascular structure of a coronary artery tree in CTA and to MRI images were performed to show the versatility and flexibility of the proposed framework. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

In spite of issues in contour initialization, boundary concavities and high-level computation, active contour models (snakes) are popular and successful method for segmentation among researchers. Segmentation process in snakes consists of calculation of energy and deformation of contour. In this paper, we present a new deformation method for active contour model, multi-resolution deformation based on wavelet ensuring powerful time reduction, high accuracy supported by stable results in convergence of an initial contour to target boundary in medical image segmentation.	aatf gene;active contour model;computation;contour line;convergence (action);ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;high- and low-level;image analysis;image segmentation;medical image;multiresolution analysis;numerous;snakes;wavelet;biologic segmentation	Sung Won Yoon;Chungkeun Lee;Jin Kwon Kim;Myoungho Lee	2007	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-007-9124-6	image texture;wavelet;computer vision;range segmentation;image analysis;computer science;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;active contour model;region growing;image segmentation;minimum spanning tree-based segmentation;scale-space segmentation;segmentation;computer graphics (images)	Vision	44.941483373349044	-74.07121837173356	196657
b0c3729c89d29774918d2dc2628e697e5de50fb5	a novel mra framework based on integrated global and local analysis for accurate segmentation of the cerebral vascular system		A novel, fully automated segmentation framework that can extract cerebral blood vessels larger than 1 mm diameter from time-offlight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) scans was developed. The segmentation framework consists of the following main steps: 1) Following bias correction, the TOF-MRA image is modeled as a a three-dimensional (3-D) generalized Gauss-Markov random field (GGMRF) where pairwise interactions between the 26-neighborhood voxels enhance the homogeneity of brain and vascular tissues while preserving the 3-D edges between them. 2) To automatically extract the region of interest, a novel approach was developed to remove the skull from TOF-MRA images based on the integration of the Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) model of TOF-MRA visual appearance with a geometric deformable model (brain isosurface) that preserves brain topology during the extraction process. 3) The initial vascular system is extracted using Bayes classifier following the estimation of the marginal probability density of TOF-MRA voxel values for both blood vessels and other brain tissues, modeled as a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG). 4) To enhance the extraction of small vessels, a seed-generation refinement algorithm was used to identify points within regions likely to contain small vessels overlooked by the previous step. 5) Finally, a 3-D region-growing connected components algorithm was applied to extract the final, connected vascular tree. The proposed approach was tested on in-vivo data (200 TOF-MRA data sets), and qualitatively and quantitatively validated by an MRA expert (ground truth). The proposed approach resulted in high segmentation accuracy with 86% Dice similarity coefficient, and 10% absolute volume difference.	algorithm;coefficient;connected component (graph theory);ground truth;interaction;isosurface;marginal model;markov chain;markov random field;refinement (computing);region growing;region of interest;resonance;video-in video-out;voxel	Heba Kandil;Ahmed Soliman;Luay Fraiwan;Ahmed Shalaby;Ali H.

dcdbfc07ce4be6a7c1482c0018694b62b70adce1	automatic 3d segmentation of individual facial muscles using unlabeled prior information		Segmentation of facial soft tissues is required for surgical planning and evaluation, but this is laborious using manual methods and has been difficult to achieve with digital segmentation methods. A new automatic 3D segmentation method for facial soft tissues in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images was designed, implemented, and tested. A region growing algorithm based on local energy functions, using intensity similarities among neighboring regions as criteria, was developed. This local energy function includes the neighborhood relationships not only in the same dataset but from other training datasets. This approach differs from previous studies where the prior information was represented as manual segmented atlases. In this study, a consensus of many datasets, none of which was labeled a priori, is used to guide the segmentation. The method was tested in MRI scans for adult facial structures. MRI scans were obtained from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative database. Comparison was made to results from expert manual segmentation and region growing techniques. The volumetric overlap between automated 3D segmentation results and the ground truth was 82.6% for masseter and 78.8% for temporalis tissues. A new automated method to segment various facial soft tissues was implemented and the results compared with standard region growing results. The proposed method shows 3.9% improvement in accuracy over the standard method. Reduction in segmentation errors was consistently achieved in MRI scans.

We construct an atlas of the hippocampus as a mean shape and develop statistical models to characterize quantitative and qualitative normal shape variation. We also develop a localization tool to identify local contrasts in the anatomy of different populations. The tool is applied to the detection, characterization and visualization of anatomical differences such as local enlargement and gains in volume on the right hippocampus of blind subjects.	anatomic structures;bend minimization;cervical atlas;computational anatomy;decompression sickness;enlargement procedure;first-order predicate;imagery;internationalization and localization;population;statistical model	Xinyang Liu;Washington Mio;Yonggang Shi;Ivo D.

fb86b55f4e066bacf9d98aeddda839adfbb82726	a deep boltzmann machine-driven level set method for heart motion tracking using cine mri images	deep boltzmann machine;distance regularized level-set evolution;generative shape model;heart motion tracking;mri-guided radiation therapy	Heart motion tracking for radiation therapy treatment planning can result in effective motion management strategies to minimize radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. However, automatic heart motion tracking is challenging due to factors that include the complex spatial relationship between the heart and its neighboring structures, dynamic changes in heart shape, and limited image contrast, resolution, and volume coverage. In this study, we developed and evaluated a deep generative shape model-driven level set method to address these challenges. The proposed heart motion tracking method makes use of a heart shape model that characterizes the statistical variations in heart shapes present in a training data set. This heart shape model was established by training a three-layered deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) in order to characterize both local and global heart shape variations. During the tracking phase, a distance regularized level-set evolution (DRLSE) method was applied to delineate the heart contour on each frame of a cine MRI image sequence. The trained shape model was embedded into the DRLSE method as a shape prior term to constrain an evolutional shape to reach the desired heart boundary. Frame-by-frame heart motion tracking was achieved by iteratively mapping the obtained heart contour for each frame to the next frame as a reliable initialization, and performing a level-set evolution. The performance of the proposed motion tracking method was demonstrated using thirty-eight coronal cine MRI image sequences.		Jian Wu;Thomas R.

We propose to segment the lymph node regions without directly including them in the atlas registration process; instead, they are segmented using the dense deformation field computed from the registration of the atlas structures with distinct boundaries. This approach results in robust and accurate segmentation of the lymph node regions even in the presence of significant anatomical variations between the atlas-image and the patient's image to be segmented. We also present a quantitative evaluation of lymph node regions segmentation using various statistical as well as geometrical metrics: sensitivity, specificity, dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance. A comparison of the proposed method with two other state of the art methods is presented. The robustness of the proposed method to the atlas selection, in segmenting the lymph node regions, is also evaluated.	active contour model;atlas autocode;coefficient;contour line;hausdorff dimension;image registration;sensitivity and specificity	Sai Subrahmanyam Gorthi;Valerie Duay;Nawal Houhou;Meritxell Bach Cuadra;Ulrike Schick;Minerva Becker;Abdelkarim Allal;Jean-Philippe Thiran	2009	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2011104	computer vision;radiation therapy;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Vision	41.24795817038573	-78.9721712564807	198015

In contrast to other approaches for segmenting brain structures, its design allows for parallel segmentation of individual brain structures within a flexible and robust hierarchical framework such that accurate adaptation and volume computation can be achieved within a minute of processing time. Furthermore, adaptation is driven by local and not global contrast, potentially relaxing requirements with respect to preprocessing steps such as bias-field correction. Detailed evaluation experiments on more than 1000 subjects, including comparisons to FSL FIRST and FreeSurfer as well as a clinical assessment, demonstrate high accuracy and test-retest consistency of the presented segmentation approach, leading, for example, to an average segmentation error of less than 0.5 mm. The presented approach might be useful in both, research as well as clinical routine, for automated segmentation and volume quantification of subcortical brain structures in order to increase confidence in the diagnosis of neuro-degenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, or clinical applications for other neurologic and psychiatric diseases.

While NC image evaluation is typically performed through manual inspection by an expert, computer-aided approaches of capillary inspection can reduce the time required for diagnosis. The aim of NC image analysis is usually to extract the skeletons of the capillaries present in the image which form the basis of further analysis for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an improved binarisation technique for NC image analysis that addresses the challenge of non-uniform background by employing a Difference-of-Gaussian approach before thresholding, coupled with a post-processing stage to remove smaller image artefacts. Based on two previously published NC skeletonisation algorithms, we demonstrate that our technique leads to significantly better skeleton extraction on different types of NC images.	algorithm;circuit complexity;difference of gaussians;ground truth;image analysis;image noise;logical connective;otsu's method;pipeline (computing);thresholding (image processing);video post-processing;visual inspection	Niraj P.

The modeling suite incorporates knowledge about the breast tissue characteristics, compression eeects, and mammogram acquisition process. Given a speciic segmentation task, this information is utilized by the system to invoke proper operators from the image processing suite. The paper discuses the segmentation system in context of a spe-ciic segmentation task involving identiication of the bro-glandular tissue. 1: Introduction This paper describes a model-based system for task-driven mammogram segmentation. The system is designed to perform various segmentation tasks, including to globally segment a mammogram into anatomic regions, e.g., bro-glandular and adipose tissue, or to perform a more detailed partitioning, e.g., to detect ductal network or speciic abnormalities. The utility of mammogram segmentation is multifold and it includes detection of abnormalities and increasing sensitivity to detection of cancerous changes through identiication of anatomical structures associated with high incidence of cancer which can subsequently be subjected to detailed analysis by the detection algorithm. The conceptual design of the proposed segmentation system is outlined in Figure 1. The input to the system consists of mammograms to be segmented (with the information about acquisition and digitization parameters) and segmentation objective. The system encompasses two parts: the modeling suite and the image processing suite. Mammogram segmentation is achieved by the image processing suite, which contains various operators, including wavelets, fractals, and operators capturing intensity, scale-space, textural, shape, and structural image properties. Appropriate operators are selected based on the speciied task and the input provided by the modeling suite. The modeling suite contains a breast model which incorporates general knowledge about 3-D arrangement of diierent tissues, their anatomic, histologic, and radiographic characteristics, and general knowledge about mammogram acquisition (including eeects of attenuation and overlapping projections).

Intensity-based volume registration methods can align subcortical structures well, but the variability in sulcal folding patterns typically results in misalignment of the cortical surface. Conversely, surface-based registration using sulcal features can produce excellent cortical alignment but the mapping between brains is restricted to the cortical surface. Here we describe a method for volumetric registration that also produces an accurate one-to-one point correspondence between cortical surfaces. This is achieved by first parameterizing and aligning the cortical surfaces using sulcal landmarks. We then use a constrained harmonic mapping to extend this surface correspondence to the entire cortical volume. Finally, this mapping is refined using an intensity-based warp. We demonstrate the utility of the method by applying it to T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs).

The WN presented here is a member of fixed-grid WNs that is formed with no need of training. In this WN, after formation of wavelet lattice, determining shift and scale parameters of wavelets with two screening stage and selecting effective wavelets, orthogonal least squares algorithm is used to calculate the network weights and to optimize the network structure. The existence of two stages of screening increases globality of the wavelet lattice and provides a better estimation of the function especially for larger scales. R, G, and B values of a dermoscopy image are considered as the network inputs and the network structure formation. Then, the image is segmented and the skin lesions exact boundary is determined accordingly. The segmentation algorithm were applied to 30 dermoscopic images and evaluated with 11 different metrics, using the segmentation result obtained by a skilled pathologist as the ground truth. Experimental results show that our method acts more effectively in comparison with some modern techniques that have been successfully used in many medical imaging problems.	dermoscopy;ground truth;large;least squares;medical imaging;ordinary least squares;stage level 1;wn, rat strain;wavelet analysis;weight;wordnet;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Amir Reza Sadri;Maryam Zekri;Saeed Sadri;Niloofar Gheissari;Mojgan Mokhtari;Farzaneh Kolahdouzan	2013	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2227478	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;mathematics;skin;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Vision	39.74147088377424	-77.19395434395307	199280

In this paper, an improved statistical approach to extracting whole cerebrovascular tree in time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography is proposed. Firstly, in order to get a more accurate segmentation result, a localized observation model is proposed instead of defining the observation model over the entire dataset. Secondly, for the binary segmentation, an improved Iterative Conditional Model (ICM) algorithm is presented to accelerate the segmentation process. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can obtain more satisfactory segmentation results and save more processing time than conventional approaches, simultaneously.	blood supply aspects;discriminative model;extracellular matrix;iterated conditional modes;iterative method;resonance;science of neurosurgery;segmentation action;silo (dataset);algorithm;angiogram;biologic segmentation	J.

In this paper, we propose a novel patch-driven level sets method for segmentation of neonatal brain images by taking advantage of sparse representation techniques. Specifically, we first build a subject-specific atlas from a library of aligned, manually segmented images by using sparse representation in a patch-based fashion. Then, the spatial consistency in the subject-specific atlas is further enforced by considering the similarities of a patch with its neighboring patches. Finally, this subject-specific atlas is integrated into a coupled level set framework for surface-based neonatal brain segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on 20 training subjects using leave-one-out cross validation, and on 132 additional testing subjects. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.	cross-validation (statistics);image quality;image segmentation;patch (computing);sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Li Wang;Feng Shi;Gang Li;Weili Lin;John H.

A multi Gabor feature map of the liver tumor image is computed to describe the homogeneity of patches in a nonlocal way, and the nonlocal comparisons between pairs of patches are used to calculate the active contour energy. The whole energy function is minimized via a level set method to give the final segmentation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method leads to good liver tumor segmentation with a good robustness to initialization condition. Experiment results show the proposed method can provide segmentation close to manual results, with the mean overlap error (OE) less than 23.86%.	active contour model;aharonov–bohm effect;image segmentation;mathematical optimization;nonlocal lagrangian;radio frequency	Bin Chen;Yang Chen;Guanyu Yang;Jingyu Meng;Rui Zeng;Limin Luo	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351504	computer vision;pattern recognition;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation	Robotics	40.0159619495546	-78.38398802275567	199855
b0b74f82136857125a0c31cfa01b3c4e8ce708b5	bayesian principal geodesic analysis in diffeomorphic image registration		Computing a concise representation of the anatomical variability found in large sets of images is an important first step in many statistical shape analyses. In this paper, we present a generative Bayesian approach for automatic dimensionality reduction of shape variability represented through diffeomorphic mappings. To achieve this, we develop a latent variable model for principal geodesic analysis (PGA) that provides a probabilistic framework for factor analysis on diffeomorphisms. Our key contribution is a Bayesian inference procedure for model parameter estimation and simultaneous detection of the effective dimensionality of the latent space. We evaluate our proposed model for atlas and principal geodesic estimation on the OASIS brain database of magnetic resonance images. We show that the automatically selected latent dimensions from our model are able to reconstruct unseen brain images with lower error than equivalent linear principal components analysis (LPCA) models in the image space, and it also outperforms tangent space PCA (TPCA) models in the diffeomorphism setting.	atlases;bayesian network;cervical atlas;dimensionality reduction;dimensions;estimation theory;factor analysis;heart rate variability;image registration;inference;latent variable model;mixture model;population parameter;principal component analysis;principal geodesic analysis;resonance;sample variance;shape context;spatial variability;statistical model;registration - actclass	Miaomiao Zhang;P.
