b7fc2c8398eba99583239e82408c41de641a1771	guest editors’ foreword		The papers in this issue were selected as among the best theoretical contributions among the papers at the Seventh International Meeting on DNA-Based Computers, held from June 10–13, 2001 at the University of South Florida. The papers were invited for submission to this issue. They have undergone standard refereeing procedures for acceptance to TOCS. The paper “P Systems with Global Rules” by Andrei Păun describes a computing framework, namely membrane computing, inspired by the functioning of cells. In the particular model presented here, a single set of rules determines the way objects in each membrane-bounded region are processed. Păun shows that this restricted model is capable of generating all recursively enumerable languages. The paper “Programmed Mutagenesis Is Universal” by Julia Khodor and David Gifford describes a DNA computation method that uses cycles of DNA annealing, ligation, and polymerization to implement programmatic rewriting of DNA sequences, and shows the universality of this model. Furthermore, the experimental efficiency of a programmed mutagenesis system is discussed in the paper, based on laboratory simulations of a unary counter. The paper “Characterizing the Micronuclear Gene Patterns in Ciliates” by Andrzej Ehrenfeucht, Tero Harju, Ion Petre, and Grzegorz Rozenberg examines the computational processes of gene assembly in ciliates, which can be considered a form of DNA computation in vivo. They identify three simple molecular operations that are employed in assembling genes in ciliates. For each subset of the set of three operations, they characterize the micronuclear gene patterns that can be assembled using this subset of operations. We are very grateful to the authors and referees for their timely work in preparing and reviewing the manuscripts. We thank the authors for their contributions.	computation;julia;marian petre;membrane computing;p system;program counter;recursively enumerable language;rewriting;simulated annealing;simulation;unary operation;universal turing machine;video-in video-out	Mitsunori Ogihara;Anne Condon	2002	Theory of Computing Systems	10.1007/s00224-002-9000-1		Comp.	-48.38539792192167	-13.083819451271722	152723

0b16560c174c2540f20f97e78f5b03d1403e9169	special issue in computing and visualization in science (cvs) related to the european multigrid conference, emg 2010	european multigrid conference;special issue	With great pleasure we present the special issue in CVS related to the European Multigrid conference, which took place on the island Isola d’Ischia in Italy from 19 to 23 September, 2010. The conference was organized by Alfio Borzi (at that time at the Università degli Studi del Sannio, in Benevento, Italy, now at the University of Würzburg, Germany), and Cornelis Oosterlee, from the CWI—Center for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, and the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. In fact, we have two special issues in two journals, as both organizers are handling editors of different journals. Next to this issue in CVS, we will have a second one in the journal Numerical Mathematics: Theory, Methods and Applications (NM-TMA). Both issues appear at approximately the same time, and contain seven contributions each, which makes fourteen special issue publications related to EMG2010 in total. The EMG conference series provides a forum for researchers to present and discuss recent advances on the development, theory, and application of multigrid, multilevel, and multiscale methodologies. Previous EMG conferences were held in Cologne (1981, 1985), Bonn(1990), Amsterdam (1993), Stuttgart (1996), Gent (1999), Hohenwart (2002), Scheveningen (2005), Bad Herrenhalb (2008).

3359bf07485bbc8b92298a8978cdcbb1e5bf8a16	"""guest editors' foreword to the special issue devoted to the international conference """"numerical computations: theory and algorithms"""" june 17-23, 2013, falerna, italy"""		http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2015.02.043 0096-3003/ 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. This special issue of the Applied Mathematics and Computation contains 23 high-quality research papers dealing with a number of areas of applied mathematics, computer science, and pure mathematics. The papers included in this special issue are based on the presentations carefully selected by the guest editors among the talks delivered at the international conference ‘‘Numerical computations: Theory and Algorithms (NUMTA)’’ held in June 17–23, 2013, Falerna, Italy. The NUMTA 2013 has been organized by the University of Calabria, Rende (CS), Italy and the N.I. Lobachevski State University of Nizhni Novgorod, Russia, in cooperation with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, USA. The two universities have a twenty years long collaboration in the framework of the international research and educational program ‘‘Italian–Russian University’’ and the NUMTA 2013 was one of the major events organized jointly by the two institutions. The guest editors participated actively in the organization of the conference: the Program Committee of the NUMTA 2013 was chaired by Yaroslav D. Sergeyev, the Organizing Committee by Dmitri E. Kvasov, and Renato De Leone took part in both Committees and was one of the plenary lecturers. The goal of the NUMTA 2013 was the creation of a multidisciplinary round table for an open discussion on numerical modeling nature by using traditional and emerging computational paradigms. Participants of this conference discussed several aspects of numerical computations and modeling from foundations of mathematics and computer science to advanced numerical techniques. Four main bulks of papers can be distinguished in the special issue. The first group of articles is related to computations with infinities and infinitesimals. This group of articles reflects the fact that during the Conference special attention (four plenary lectures and a series of regular talks) was dedicated to a recently introduced methodology working with infinities and infinitesimals numerically. The new methodology evolves Cantor’s ideas in a more applied way and introduces infinite numbers that possess both cardinal and ordinal properties as the usual finite numbers. Thanks to a promptly introduced positional numeral system with an infinite radix called ‘‘grossone’’ (this number has been introduced as the number of elements of the set of natural numbers) it becomes possible to write down in a unique framework different infinities and infinitesimals and to execute numerical computations with all of them on a new kind of a computational device called the Infinity Computer. The second group of papers in the special issue studies optimization problems: global and local, single-objective and multi-objective, discrete and continuous, sequential and parallel problems are here considered. Then, the third group of articles is dedicated to solving differential equations numerically and the fourth group contains a number of papers dedicated to mathematical modeling of physical phenomena. The guest editors have a pleasant duty to thank all the individuals and institutions who helped them in making this special issue published. First of all, the guest editors on behalf of the Program and Organizing Committees of the NUMTA 2013 thank the sponsors of the Conference for their generous support.

The workshop was organized in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB), the flagship conference of the ACM SIGBio, as in previous years. The CNB-MAC workshop aims to provide an international scientific forum for presenting recent advances in computational network biology that involve modeling, analysis, and control of biological systems and system-oriented analysis of large-scale OMICS data. CNB-MAC 2017 was co-chaired by Drs. Byung-Jun Yoon, Xiaoning Qian, and Tamer Kahveci. The workshop featured 14 oral presentations, which were carefully selected by the workshop chairs based on thorough reviews by the technical committee members. The final presentations at the workshop included 12 original research, one review, and one extended abstract. With the generous support provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Student Travel Grants have been awarded to student authors of outstanding research papers and posters that have been invited for presentation at CNB-MAC 2017. Dr. Ranadip Pal served as the award chair for CNB-MAC 2017, and 9 awardees were selected by the award committee after a careful review of the applications and the submitted work.	aclarubicin;artificial neural network;awards;bioinformatics;biological network;biological system;c++builder;chairs;computation;computational biology;ibm notes;informatics (discipline);macrophage-1 antigen;mycobacterium avium complex;nephrogenic systemic fibrosis;omics;ppp3r1 gene;ppp3r1 wt allele;paper;qian-wang-hong-bai-san	Byung-Jun Yoon;Xiaoning Qian;Tamer Kahveci;Ranadip Pal	2018		10.1186/s12859-018-2058-9	computational biology;biological network;bioinformatics;computational and statistical genetics;computer science	Visualization	-48.54504425275498	-12.922972710289503	186202

The current article presents the game-theoretic values for rectangular boards up to a surface of 30 intersections under Chinese rules. The result was achieved by improving the αβ-based solver MIGOS. Moreover, the article identifies errors in published human solutions by comparing them with our computer solutions.	computer go;game theory;solver	Erik C. D. van der Werf;Mark H. M.

In order to promote this new paradigm, the Molecular Robotics Research Group was established in the Systems and Information Division of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers (SICE) in 2010. The group consists of researchers from various fields including chemistry, biophysics, DNA nanotechnology, systems science and robotics, challenging this emerging new field. Last year, the group proposed a research project focusing on molecular robotics, and it was recently awarded a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (FY2012-16), one of the large-scale research projects in Japan, by MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JAPAN). Here, we wish to clarify the fundamental concept and research direction of molecular robotics. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive view of molecular robotics based on the discussions held in the Molecular Robotics Research Group.	molecular nanotechnology;programming paradigm;robot;robotics;systems science	Satoshi Murata;Akihiko Konagaya;Satoshi Kobayashi;Hirohide Saito;Masami Hagiya	2012	New Generation Computing	10.1007/s00354-012-0121-z	computer science;geography of robotics;future of robotics;educational robotics;developmental robotics	Robotics	-50.95238078990306	-12.396096616279324	192588

The conferencewas organized in a beautiful French city of Montpellier, which is world-wide famous for its historical monuments and scientific tradition. It was held on the 17-20th of April 2016 and was supported by the local organizer and hosted by Aida Todri from LIRMM-CNRS. This time the conference was attended by 170 attendants from all over the world. It was a good time, that was devoted to technical sessions, poster presentations and last but not the least allowed exchanging the experience and knowledge between theworld class professionals through common social events and divers technicalmeetings. Traditionally on Sunday, a day before the official conference opening, 3 short training courses and workshops were organized, which were prepared for the both engineers and scientists. Over the next 3 days of the conference there were all together 22 regular sessions. All the session were organized and scheduled in parallel. Traditionally, the conference was technically sponsored by IEEE – CPMT and financially co-sponsored by a number of companies including: Philips Lighting, Robert Bosch GmbH, Siemens. Additionally, over the whole event exhibitors were presenting their products and had an uncountable number of fruitful discussions with the conference attendants. The annual EuroSimE conference is the only international conferencewith a direct focus on Thermal, Mechanical andMulti-Physics Simulations and Experiments in Micro-Electronics and Micro-Systems taking into account multi-physics and multi-scaling issues of micro and nano dimensions. Each year Technical Committeemakes a substantial effort to provide high quality papers, presentations, exhibitions and workshops in order to highlight the important research topics directed towards development problems, major technological and industrial trends, challenges and future roadmap. Nowadays in most of the leading electronic companies it is a common practice to use numerical prototypingmethods and tools. The reason for that is on one hand short-time-to-market, enhanced functionality and improved quality but on the second hand the improved profitability of the electronic industry.
