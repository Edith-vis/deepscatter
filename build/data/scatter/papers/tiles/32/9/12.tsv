This influence is tracked (through a generalized, Information-laden scientific Style of Reasoning denoting the Information-theoretical and Computational turn in science), with a focus on the information processing and transfer metaphors and descriptive tools prevalent in current physics. Implementation of Information-Theoretical concepts produces such mathematical physical developments as Black-Hole Thermodynamics (BHTD) and the Black-Hole War. The treatment of physical systems as information processing systems drives such branches of physics as Quantum Information Theory (QIT). The common Informational basis of computation and communication brings about a foundational shift in scientific reasoning with deep – potentially problematic as well as intriguing – philosophical ramifications. Models of computation and of physics 1 Scientific Revolutions through a New Style of Reasoning Conceptions (Rolf Landauer, 1991) of physical reality as an Information1 -processing system permeate current science -from rigorous statistical analysis (thermodynamics of black holes), through semantic aspirations to world-views such as Extreme Digital Ontology. Information processing ontologies are heralded as new Galilean world-systems of Info-Computationalism.2 As pervasive (Gleick, 2011) and perhaps overused a concept as it is – Information is heralded by some as 'the new language of science' (Baeyer, 2004). Even if accepted, this role requires a finer tuned description, offered by Hacking’s Styles of Reasoning. This brand of metaconcepts (Hacking, 1992, 2004) enables a description of a science imbued with information processing and transmission terminology. Hacking’s Styles (adopted from Crombie3) come about through scientific revolutions, quieter than paradigm-shifts or the great scientific revolutions of the 20 th century, but with deep impact on science and society. 1 The term “Information” will – unless explicitly defined otherwise – refer to the leanest technical definition in binary digits that constitute the units of digitized information in modern computation and computation theories (C.E. Shannon, 1948). 2 Cf. (Dodig-Crnkovic and Burgin 2011, 149–184): “A Dialogue Concerning Two World Systems: Info-Computational vs. Mechanistic”, for an outline of internal conceptual differences between different modes of scientific modelling – those infused with Information and the classical world system of energy and matter. The emphasis here is more on the confluence of Information’s various uses and the way they change physical modelling – and reciprocally redefining elements of computation. 3 (Hacking, 1982), p.161 – the list includes: simple mathematical postulations; experimentation; modeling; taxonomy; statistical reasoning; and historical-genetic development. Styles are discursive ('reasoning' rather than Crombie’s conceptual 'thinking') meta-concepts in science, describing motifs of epistemic sense-making (for the scientific, epistemic and social spheres); broad cross-disciplinary motifs in scientific and institutional spheres. Styles permeate many aspects of scientific research and their respective sociological, political and cultural setting. Unlike other meta-concepts that organize the scientific weltanschauung , different styles can co-exist with previously established ones. The criteria for a new Style, and its associated 'revolution' (Schweber and Watcher, 2000; Hacking, 1993) include a new scientific vocabulary as well as a wider social and conceptual context – an impact on multiple disciplines and new institutions relying on the standards for rationality given by the meta-conceptual frame of the style. 20 A. Voronkov (ed.), Turing-100 (EPiC Series, vol. 10), pp. 20–33 Hacking's Styles of Reasoning as listed by Hacking (Hacking, 1982) (following the historical outline laid out by Crombie (1995)) are meta-concepts that arrange the scheme of ideas and practices in science and society. Not precisely paradigm-shifts closer to Foucalts epistemes They are the conceptual schemes in which (In Hacking’s words) researchers: “ ...researchers look actively for problems to formulate and solve, rather than for an accepted consensus without argument. The varieties of scientific method so brought into play may be distinguished as: (a) the simple postulation established in the mathematical sciences, (b) the experimental exploration and measurement of more complex observable relations, (c) the hypothetical construction of analogical models, (d) the ordering of variety by comparison and taxonomy, (e) the statistical analysis of regularities of populations and the calculus of probabilities, and (f) the historical derivation of genetic development. The first three of these methods concern essentially the science of individual regularities, and the second three the science of the regularities of populations ordered in space and time.” The rise of a Style of Reasoning manifests in a Hacking-Type Revolution (Coined by Schweber (2000, p. 583)), which is the process of the new Style’s asserting itself. I posit that the computationcommunication turn marks the rise of a new Style of Reasoning, involving its own revolution, a process with distinct features of scientific agendas, new semantic fields, institutions and social influence. In a nutshell, it is an emplacement rather than replacement revolution (Humphreys, 2011, p. 132). The latter is the more prominent kind, where the old system is abandoned in concept, theory or practice. The former is a change in the way science is done that does not forgo the existing methods and ideas. The existing disciplines are not replaced but rather slide into the new world-system, driven by a new terminology like a Munchousian wolf substituting the horse from within in midstride, pulling the carriage all the way to St. Petersburg. There is no incommensurable gap between the two world-systems, and yet a new language takes over.4 According to Hacking (1992, pp. 130–157), a new Style boasts new sentences, new objects of research, and criteria for law-like regularities. Reasoning – unlike Crombie’s thinking – relates to multiple levels of scientific discourse: the conceptual, experimental, sociological. Schweber & Watcher (2000, p. 585) recognized in the computational (Information-processing) revolution the rise of a new Style: “We are witnessing another Hacking type revolution, which for lack of a better name we call the ‘complex systems modeling and simulation’ revolution, for complexity is one of its buzzwords and mathematical modeling and simulation on computers constitute its Style of Reasoning”. I propose that this Style and its associated Hacking-type revolution be incorporated into the ubiquity of Information-Theoretical and Information-Processing terminology in science (Baeyer, 2004), creating a generalized form of the shift based on Information concepts: That is, a HackingType revolution of Information-laden science, with digitized Information as its Style. Digitized Information relates to the entire gamut of modern communication and computation. This revolution is subtle but pervasive; at its core the concept of Information in science and society, from the practice 4 Hacking's criteria for such subtle revolutions are (Hacking, 1982, 1992), used by Schweber & Watcher (2000, p. 583): i) They transform a wide range of scientific practices and they are multi-disciplinary. In a Hacking-type revolution something happens in more than one discipline; a multiplicity of scientific disciplines are transformed. ii) New institutions are formed that epitomize the new directions. iii) They are linked with substantial social change. After a Hacking-type revolution there is a different feel to the world, there is a marked change in the texture of the world. iv) Because they are “big” there can be no complete, all-encompassing history of a Hacking type revolution.

It presents some mild criticisms of this view, some based on the EPR and Wigner’s friend scenarios, and some based on the quantum theory of measurement. A few alternative suggestions for implementing a subjectivist interpretation of probability in quantum mechanics conclude the chapter. “M. Braque est un jeune homme fort audacieux. [...] Il méprise la forme, réduit tout, sites et figures et maisons, à des schémas géométriques, à des cubes. Ne le raillons point, puisqu’il est de bonne foi. Et attendons.” Thus commented the French art critic Louis Vauxcelles on Braque’s first oneman show in November 1908, thereby giving cubism its name. Substituting spheres and tetrahedra for cubes might be more appropriate if one wishes to apply the characterisation to qBism — the view of quantum mechanics and the quantum state developed by Chris Fuchs and co-workers (for a general reference see either the paper in this volume, or Fuchs (2010)). In this note, I shall not comment on other possible analogies, nor shall I present an exhaustive critical review of qBism (for an excellent one, see Timpson ∗Department of Philosophy, University of Aberdeen, and Institut d’Histoire et de Philosophie des Sciences et des Techniques (CNRS, Paris 1, ENS).

More and more academic publications reporting on experiments on SH can be found. A comprehensive clustering of concepts and approaches is largely missing. Based on an extensive review of SH literature, this paper proposes a framework that decomposes the SH research into four domains and 15 sub-domains. The framework is applied to visualize the state of the art of SH research, and to outline future challenges. The framework helps researchers to identify gaps in SH research.	cluster analysis;experiment;home automation;robotics;sensor;ubiquitous computing;wearable computer	Sam Solaimani;Harry Bouwman;Nico Baken	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21535-3_25	embedded system;home automation;computer science;data mining;operations research	HCI	-49.66364020753059	-22.664580069452565	149784

Yet, literature is by in large independent of the particular medium that is the book, as reminds us the age-old oral tradition or the contemporary research of the Oulipo. The incursion of the computer into literature has the important merit to have liberated it from the shackles of the book. The shattering of established points of references has essentially reintroduced all the issues at stake in the field of literature. In this way, the new medium emancipates the different possibilities of expression that opens up new areas of production, from the poetics of kinetics to combined, participative, hypertextuel, generative or spectacular literature, all this without taking account hitherto unknown forms of writing that are still to appear.

The idea that word length plays an important role in linguistic self-regulation was already introduced by G.K.

Development of assistive exoskeletons began in the 1960's but older designs lacked design for human factors and ergonomics and had low power energy density and power to weight ratios. Advancements in technology have spurred a broad spectrum of research aimed at enhancing human performance and assisting in rehabilitation. The review underwent a holistic and extensive search and provides a reflective snapshot of the state of the art in exoskeleton design as it pertains to the incorporation of exoskeletons for ergonomic intervention. Some of the remaining challenges include improving the energy density of exoskeleton power supplies, improving the power to weight ratio of actuation devices, improving the mechanical human-machine interface, and dealing with variability between users.

One of the first links between the medical arts and the electrical world was created by Mr. L. Galvani, who stimulated frog legs to move when a voltage was applied to their muscles. That effect was not fully pursued at the time and the stethoscope remained for a long time the most important and most impressive instrument a physician had to rely upon to determine the medical condition of his patients. However, in the period after the discovery of radio waves by Heinrich Hertz and before the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube (now the electron tube) by John Ambrose Fleming, Willem Einthoven (Fig. 1) invented the cardiograph. This took place after he thoroughly investigated the physiology of the human body, using the basic understanding of physics as available at that time. This fundamental new medical instrument was a major achievement that gave a new dimension to the understanding of potential heart problems. It tremendously improved the quality of human life. The modern version of the cardiograph with all its new electronic advancements is still a basic diagnostic instrument for the medical profession. After finishing his education as a medical doctor, Einthoven would soon follow his ambition to investigate the effects of the newly gained knowledge on electricity and applying the physics of the human physiology, as well as the use of their tools and instruments. Einthoven was appointed professor at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands at the age of 25. Most of his studies were directed towards electrophysiology on human behavior, in particular how to make this science beneficial to the patients; studies on the bronchia and, in particular, on the eye were included. New experiments he undertook were directed toward investigations on electricity within corporal bodies. Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/JPROC.2006.886022 Fig. 1. Prof. Dr. W. Einthoven.

VRef makes it possible for users to post their information needs to a virtual space accessible to all system users. Information needs are addressed by reference librarians or by automated agents that use knowledge about problems solved successfully in the past. Whereas reference librarians have pre-assigned roles in this interaction, other users may volunteer their expertise and participate in the solution of open questions. The interaction among users playing different roles is recorded so successful responses form a valuable knowledge repository that can be reused and enriched by users and their agents. VRef facilitates the transition from the traditional reference desk on to the more dynamic role of a digital reference librarian.		J.

54da5a297915556dbd72fb62e5bdcf7f73d3b174	colin allen and marc bekoff, species of mind: the philosophy and biology of cognitive ethology	colin allen;cognitive ethology;marc bekoff	The new field of cognitive ethology owes much to the collaborative efforts of Colin Allen (a philosopher) and Marc Bekoff (a cognitive ethologist). In the past several years, this dynamic duo has published a series of articles defending, clarifying, and extending the cognitive ethological program (see, e.g., Bekoff and Allen, 1992; Allen and Bekoff, 1994, 1995). Species of Mindmarks their first book project together, and it is, to my knowledge, the first and only book-length effort to expound the fundamental tenets of cognitive ethology. For this reason alone, it is a book that belongs on the shelves of anyone interested in questions about nonhuman animal minds, but, happily, there are other reasons to recommend it. The book consists of a preface and nine chapters. In these chapters, Allen and Bekoff describe the basic goals of cognitive ethology, trace its roots from Darwin through Konrad Lorenz, Nikolaas Tinbergen, and Donald Griffin, defend it against charges that it is a hopelessly imprecise and “soft” science, respond to specific philosophical worries about representational content, and consider how and whether cognitive ethologists should study nonhuman animal (henceforth, ‘animal’) consciousness. The most challenging and interesting chapters are Chapter 5, “From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Ethology”; Chapter 6, “Intentionality, Social Play, and Communication”; and Chapter 7, “Antipredatory Behavior: From Vigilance to Recognition to Action”. Chapter 9, “Toward an Interdisciplinary Science of Cognitive Ethology: Synthesizing Field, Laboratory, and Armchair Approaches”, is also notable, but its detailed response to Cecilia Heyes and Anthony Dickinson’s (1990) skepticism concerning intentional explanation in the context of several studies of food-approaching behavior in chicks and rats seems out of step with the measured generality of the rest of the book. Though every chapter in the book stands fairly well on its own, one might fail to detect a couple of very sensible themes unless one reads several chapters. One of these themes concerns pluralism. The authors announce in the Preface that they “favor pluralism in all areas” (p. xii), and they’re not kidding. They are pluralists about how to describe behavior (pp. xvi, 48), about whether investigations of animal minds should take place in the laboratory or the field (pp. 12,13), about what it means to be a naturalist about the mind (p. 10), and about how to understand intentionality (pp. 14, 168). While some might see all this pluralism as waffling, it seems appropriate given cognitive ethology’s fledgling status. It’s too early in the game to overlook any potential route to a clearer understanding of animal minds.	animal consciousness;cecilia r. aragon;darwin;intentionality;marc (archive);mind;pluralism (philosophy)	Lawrence A.

7bdefa59a4dd92c8a22848bee49ed715219f573f	review of curious emotions, by ralph ellis; john benjamins publishing, 2005 (advances in consciousness research series).		At first glance, this does not look like the kind of book which would help cognitive science researchers, as Ralph Ellis is Professor of Philosophy at Clark Atlanta University and has written mainly on consciousness, affect, motivation and thinking. But Ellis’ long-term interest in the philosophy of mind makes his observations refreshingly different. He emphasises a viewpoint and approach that few have explored, making some specific suggestions which might prove fruitful research areas. Most cognitive science research (Arkin, 1998; Arleo, Smeraldi, & Gerstner, 2004; Weber, Wermter, & Zochios, 2004) takes a reactive view, where data in the environment triggers an agent to respond in some way. Ellis turns this on its head. For him it is the agent which is always active within a relatively passive environment. The agent is no tabula rasa but already has purposes of its own. Citing evidence from neuroscience and psychology, he presents a ‘‘biological organism’’ constructed as a self-organising system.	bruce ellis;cognitive science;consciousness;philosophy of mind;self-organization;weber problem	Christopher Willmot	2006	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/j.cogsys.2005.12.002	psychology;psychoanalysis;cognitive science	NLP	-55.25851723442562	-22.067136762775476	170430

17f7f921846c6dd8a59467d0abd0316bd84d0023	in this issue		Drinking water for immunocompromised rodents may be acidified and sterilized by autoclaving to eliminate potentially harmful contaminants. Once autoclaved, water bottles are often stored for a period of time before use. In the Laboratory Animal Resource Center at Indiana University School of Medicine, opened bags of autoclaved water bottles were being stored for only 2 d before being emptied, cleaned, refilled and sterilized again. Peveler, Crisler and Hickman carried out a study to determine whether this storage period was appropriate. They measured the pH and looked for organic contamination in autoclaved water bottles stored for various periods of time. The pH of autoclaved drinking water generally remained stable during storage. Furthermore, only one instance of organic contamination was detected in bottles stored for up to 119 d in opened bags in a room with individually ventilated cages. These findings suggested that the quality of autoclaved drinking water could be maintained during longer storage periods. As a result, the acceptable storage period for autoclaved water bottles in opened bags at the authors’ facility was extended to 21 d. See page 211		Warren Harrison;Victor R.

Neurosciences are being used in different realms, from theoretical to philosophical, and it is creating new approaches to established fields. We believe that all social sciences should look at how the neurosciences could contribute to their field. We view Information Systems as a conjunction of a Technical System and a Social System, and therefore we think that there is the need to analyze whether the neurosciences can contribute to the field. We propose two different approaches of how neurosciences could contribute to the IS field. The first one analyzes parallelisms between Neuroeconomy and Information Systems, and the second one applies the Neurophilosophical Methodology in an attempt to ground Pragmatism’s premises.

6c918d9c5077517298f38e0ee0df8b81ff40fd44	the standard theory of conscious perception		The Standard Theory shows how top-down a ention transforms sensory input into conscious percepts by prioritizing the former with respect to a ‘subject-level standard’–a standard rooted in the subject. According to the Standard Theory, this transformation brings about both the informational content of perception, as flagged by James, and the determination of a shared perceptual space, as flagged by Merleau-Ponty. Thus, the Standard Theory is an account of how the subject brings about the structure of conscious perception through the activity of top-down a ention.

New algorithms and high performance computing are making things possible which we could only have imagined earlier. Though the enhancements in AI are making life easier for human beings day by day, there is constant fear that AI based systems will pose a threat to humanity. People in AI community have diverse set of opinions regarding the pros and cons of AI mimicking human behavior. Instead of worrying about AI advancements, we propose a novel idea of cognitive agents, including both human and machines, living together in a complex adaptive ecosystem, collaborating on human computation for producing essential social goods while promoting sustenance, survival and evolution of the agents’ life cycle. We highlight several research challenges and technology barriers in achieving this goal. We propose a governance mechanism around this ecosystem to ensure ethical behaviors of all cognitive agents.

We have dealt with rather different subjects; and our styles, or angles of approach, have also tended to be different. But it was apparent to both of us, from very soon after we became acquainted (in Cleveland, in the fall semester of 1967), that our views of what philosophy should be – of what deserves to be regarded as serious engagement with serious philosophical questions – had a deep kinship. I hope the present paper will serve, in part, as testimony to that fact. The phrase “the enterprise of knowledge” is used by Isaac as the title of a deeply interesting book, and is intended by him to indicate the keynote of his view of epistemology, expressed pungently also in the opening words of that book, which argue that knowledge should not be considered “a matter of pedigree”: “Epistemologists ought to care for the improvement of knowledge rather than its pedigree. They ought to ask” [not what justifies the claims of a subject X to know something, but] “what X (who may be a person or a group) should do, given his knowledge at a time t , to render that knowledge more efficient in performing its functions” – a process, he immediately goes on to make clear, that may involve improving that state of knowledge itself, by expanding it or by correcting it.1 As to the phrase “the enterprise of understanding”, I use “understanding” here to refer to the grasp of ideas, or concepts; the enterprise I mean, then, is that of the clarification of ideas. And I want to suggest – what may, stated in generality, appear merely banal – that the two enterprises, that of knowledge and that of understanding, are inextricably intertwined: let me say, “Understanding without knowledge is empty; knowledge without understanding is impossible”. As to the matter of pedigree, I think I know what Isaac means, and do not disagree; but I also think that questions about pedigree do have a role to play – and I should say even more than one	c date and time functions	Howard Stein	2004	Synthese	10.1023/B:SYNT.0000029946.38831.c9	international data encryption algorithm;sensation;comprehension;enterprise system;enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;enterprise modelling;philosophy;epistemology;integrated enterprise modeling;cimosa;enterprise architecture management;mathematics;enterprise data management;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;perception;concept;enterprise planning system;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system;enterprise life cycle	NLP	-54.675352544066136	-22.568490443548427	189531

However, in its back-end there is much more: associated to each article are the edit history and talk pages, which together entail its full evolution. These spaces can typically reach thousands of contributions, and it is not trivial to make sense of them by manual inspection. This issue also affects Wikipedians, especially the less experienced ones, and constitutes a barrier for new editor engagement and retention. To address these limitations, Contropedia offers its users unprecedented access to the development of an article, using wiki links as focal points.	focal (programming language);internet;mediawiki;wiki;wikipedia	Erik Borra;David Laniado;Esther Weltevrede;Michele Mauri;Giovanni Magni;Tommaso Venturini;Paolo Ciuccarelli;Richard Rogers;Andreas Kaltenbrunner	2015			computer science;machine learning;data mining;brand;multimedia;world wide web;data visualization	Web+IR	-49.47481503068788	-23.578248637559614	193292
a2da9ffa1b280063a71b22d48816d362f2f8d607	logic and the foundations of the theory of games and decisions: introduction*		This special issue of Knowledge, Rationality and Action contains a selection of papers presented at the sixth conference on “Logic and the Foundations of the Theory of Games and Decisions” (LOFT6), which took place in Leipzig, in July 2004. The LOFT conferences have been a regular biannual event since 1994.1 The first conference was hosted by the Centre International de Recherches Mathematiques in Marseille (France), the next four took place at the International Center for Economic Research in Torino (Italy) and the most recent one was hosted by the Leipzig Graduate School of Management in Leipzig (Germany). The LOFT conferences are interdisciplinary events that bring together researchers from a variety of fields: computer science, economics, game theory, linguistics, logic, mathematical psychology, philosophy and statistics. In its original conception, LOFT had as its central theme the application of logic, in particular modal epistemic logic, to foundational issues in the theory of games and individual decision-making. Epistemic considerations have been central to game theory for a long time. The expression interactive epistemology has been used in the game-theory literature to refer to the analysis of what individuals involved in a strategic interaction know about facts concerning the external world as well as facts concerning each other’s knowledge and beliefs. What is relatively new is the realization that the tools and methodology that were used in game theory are closely related to those already used in other fields, notably computer science and philosophy. Modal logic turned out to be the common language that made it possible to bring together different professional communities. The insights gained and the methodology employed in one field can benefit researchers in a different field. Indeed, new and active areas of research have sprung from the interdisciplinary exposure provided by the LOFT conferences.2 Over time the scope of the LOFT conferences has broadened to encompass other tools, besides modal logic, that can be used to shed light on the general issues of rationality and agency. Topics that have fallen within the LOFT umbrella include epistemic and	computer science;epistemic modal logic;game theory;loft (3d);rationality	Giacomo Bonanno	2005	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-005-1346-x	mathematics;algorithm	Theory	-55.523636805724216	-20.31351706305731	193326
