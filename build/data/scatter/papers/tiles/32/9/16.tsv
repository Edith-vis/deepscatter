The novelty of this project is that it is geared towards integrating several existing systems built on heterogeneous platforms and operating environments under different administrative zones. In order to provide a user-centric view of the information resources and address the issue of scalability of the system, the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been used. The project aims at providing """"one-stop"""" access to various information resources for the benefit of the rural community that constitutes the largest section of the Indian population. The paper focuses on the implementation details and also discusses about several services that are available at the moment to the rural mass."""	information needs;scalability;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented infrastructure	Manas Ranjan Patra;Rama Krushna Das	2007		10.1145/1328057.1328070	geography;knowledge management;environmental resource management;management science;rural management	DB	-48.91633117002376	7.908014643225705	185425

To assess the current state of power electronics education, a study of curricular offering in power electronics in the U.S. universities is conducted. The study shows that there is a lack of course offering in semiconductor power devices with a lack of critical topics such as thermal management, temperature effects, reliability, power packaging, modeling, systems integration, and failure analysis. To remedy these deficiencies, new power electronics tracks/concentrations for undergraduate and graduate programs are proposed. The proposed curricular modifications are designed to be rigorous to meet the future needs of the power electronic industry, but flexible enough to be easily adopted by different institutions.	electrical engineering;failure analysis;power glove;power electronics;power semiconductor device;system integration;thermal management (electronics)	Ibrahim M.

During the last decade many efforts have been made to get closer to this ideal scenario, but the way of information processing within the CNC did not change too much. The paper summarises the requirements of an intelligent CNC evaluating the different research efforts done in this field using different artificial intelligence (AI) methods. In the second part of the paper a low cost concept for intelligent systems named Knowledge Server for Controllers (KSC) is introduced. It allows more devices to solve their intelligent processing needs using the same server that is capable to process intelligent data. In the final part this concept is used in an open CNC environment to build up an intelligent CNC. The preliminary results of the implementation are also introduced.	artificial intelligence;information processing;requirement;server (computing)	J.

In fact, given the characteristics of current disputes, technology-based conflict resolution may be a quite efficient approach. However, in this shift of paradigm, there are also threats that should be considered. Specifically, in this paper we deal with the problem of the lack of important context information when parties communicate in a virtual setting. In that sense, we propose the addition of a monitoring framework capable of measuring the level of stress of the parties in a non-invasive way. This information will be used by the platform and the mediator throughout the complete conflict resolution process to adapt strategies in real-time, resulting in a context-aware and more efficient approach.	programming paradigm;real-time clock;threat (computer)	Davide Carneiro;José Carlos Castillo;Paulo Novais;Antonio Fernández-Caballero;José Neves;María T.

aa9c4973289a1636ddb8d5b766906ffe0031eb87	gridmap: enhanced security in cued-recall graphical passwords		Despite their widespread usage, text-based passwords are vulnerable to password cracking as users tend to choose weak passwords. This is mainly because the more secure a password is, the harder it is for a user to remember it. As a promising alternative, various graphical password systems, which take advantage of the fact that humans are more sensitive to visual information than verbal text, have been proposed over the past decade. However, graphical passwords come with their own vulnerabilities, such as high susceptibility to shoulder surfing and hotspots. In this paper, we develop a new cued-recall graphical password system called GridMap by exploring (1) the use of grids with variable input entered through the keyboard, and (2) the use of geopolitical maps as background images. As a result, GridMap is able to achieve high keyspace and resistance to shoulder surfing attacks. To validate the efficacy of GridMap in practice, we conduct a user study with 50 participants. Our experimental results show that GridMap works well in domains in which a user logs in on a regular basis, and provides a memorability benefit if the chosen map has a personal significance to the user.

Solaris and Windows NT are used to illustrate these implementations. This course covers the major aspects of OS functionality and addresses both OS design issues and user level programming issues. The area of inter-process communication is not conceptually difficult for students to grasp, but the actual implementation and use of these concepts requires some practice. For the past three years, the author has experimented with the use of multi-player games as a mechanism for teaching students these programming constructs. This paper reports on these experiences.	experience;inter-process communication;operating system;windows nt	Donna S.

The optimal management of the telemedical assistance process in emergency situations, taking into consideration different communication and material resources availability, is still a major problem in telemedicine. In this paper we propose an ontology-based architecture model enabling an intelligent pervasive telemedicine tasks management. The aim of this methodological approach is to optimize the messages exchange between the different actors who are geographically located in different environments, to assure high level of quality of services delivered by the healthcare providers and consequently enable a more rapid and reliable telemedical assistance, especially in case of emergency scenarios.	anytime algorithm;display resolution;high-level programming language;pervasive informatics;ubiquitous computing	Ebrahim Nageba;Jocelyne Fayn;Paul Rubel	2009	2009 3rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare		xml;quality of service;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;operating system;rdf;ontology;database;world wide web;ubiquitous computing;health care;server	Robotics	-50.01628115978768	10.841173658218263	188443

Many users enter personal details about themselves but have poor understanding of theats such as identity theft and stalking. There is a need to educate and assist users in understanding how their personal data is exposed to other users. In this paper, we introduce the concept of negotiated audit which gives users of social networks valuable feedback about how their data is being used. Our design has three levels of auditing for both sharing and browsing data: no audit, complete audit and anonymous audit. Users can classify their data as requiring some level of auditing and can also set their browsing preference to one of the auditing levels. Users can only see some data if their browsing preference is compatible with the data's audit level thus giving rise to negotiation of how much users are willing to reveal about their activities and how much data they will be able to access. We provide a mathematical model and describe a simple social networking prototype called Sh@re that implements negotiated audit.	access control;cns;flow network;ibm notes;mathematical model;personally identifiable information;privacy;prototype;social network;upload	Alejandro Gutierrez;Apeksha Godiyal;Matt Stockton;Michael LeMay;Carl A.

Such tools, redesigned for the electronic sphere, could enhance digital legal information systems. This paper illustrates this kind of redesign, through a case study of one such tool---the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, which connects regulations to the statutes that authorize them.	digital environment;information system	Robert C.

Hence, to realize the integration of heterogeneous CAD systems, the corresponding one-dimensional topological entities must be found in the target CAD system to match the source ones. This paper presents a method to gain one-dimensional topological entity matching. The method is based on two algorithms, i.e. combining algorithm and matching algorithm. The combining algorithm is adopted to combine the edges retrieved in a source CAD system. Then, for each combined edge, the matching edges are found by using the matching algorithm in a target CAD system. The experiments prove that our method is valid for both offline and online integrations.	algorithm;computer-aided design;entity;experiment;feature model;online and offline	Xiaoxia Li;Fazhi He;Xiantao Cai;Bo Ni	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 15th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2011.5960050	electronic design automation;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;cad;blossom algorithm;prototype;solid modeling;management;computational model;new product development;collaboration	Robotics	-49.30672916413685	10.876382115413985	190101

Integrating intelligence and information into products themselves is possible with, among others, auto-ID technologies (barcode, RFID, . . .). In this paper, a new kind of intelligent product is introduced, referred to as ‘‘communicating material’’ paradigm. Through this paradigm, a product is (i) capable of embedding information on all or parts of the material that it is made of and (ii) capable of undergoing physical transformations without losing its communication ability and the data that is stored on it. This new material is used in our study to convey information between the different actors of the PLC, thus improving data interoperability, availability and sustainability. Although ‘‘communicating materials’’ provide new abilities compared to conventional products, they still have low memory capacities compared to product databases that become larger and larger. An information dissemination framework is developed in this paper to select the appropriate information to be stored on the product, at different stages of the PLC. This appropriateness is based on a degree of data relevance, which is computed by taking into account the context of use of the product (actor’s expectations, environment, . . .). This framework also provides the tools to split information on all or parts of the material.

Furthermore, by display the real-time situation through view-interface and screen, the platform can record all the operational information and propose early warning as compared with the normal consumption. This platform has achieved a 99% user satisfaction rate every year, and the operation cost of one classroom has been reduced about 30% as compared with other universities.	authorization;intelligent control;internet;real-time transcription	Xiaoliu Zhong;Haixia Li;Shuqiang Song;Junhua Xu;Jing Du	2014	2014 International Conference on Intelligent Environments	10.1109/IE.2014.51	simulation;engineering;multimedia;computer engineering	Embedded	-53.59307453025074	8.500078533525864	195368

One of the courses is at the introductory level and the other at the intermediate/advanced level, playing an importance role for teaching embedded and cyber-physical systems. In common, the two courses have an experimentation kit that contains a low-cost FPGA (Spartan-3 from Xilinx) that is made available to each group of students throughout the whole semester for the advanced digital systems course, or during the second half of the semester in the case of the introductory course. The survey attempted to perceive the degrees of importance acknowledge by students to different aspects of the infrastructure to support the digital systems laboratories, confirming the importance to have access to experimentation with physical devices even outside laboratory classes.	cyber-physical system;digital electronics;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;systems design	Luís Gomes;Anikó Costa;Filipe Moutinho;Pedro Maló	2017	2017 IEEE 15th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/INDIN.2017.8104829	field-programmable gate array;engineering;academic year;computer engineering;systems design	EDA	-53.92151895342505	4.519015966007444	195914

However, a logged station is still vulnerable to imposters when the user leaves her computer without logging-off. Keystroke dynamics methods can be useful for continuously verifying a user once the authentication process has successfully ended. However, current methods require long sessions and significant amounts of keystrokes to reliably verify users. We propose a new method that compactly represents the keystroke patterns by joining similar pairs of consecutive keystrokes. This automatically created representation reduces the session size required for inducing the user's verification model. The proposed method was evaluated on 21 legitimate users and 165 attackers. The results were encouraging and suggest that the detection performance of the proposed method is better than that of existing methods. Specifically we attained a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 3.47% and false rejection rate (FRR) of 0% using only 250 keystrokes.	authentication;event (computing);inductive reasoning;keystroke dynamics;password;rejection sampling;user (computing)	Tomer Shimshon;Robert Moskovitch;Lior Rokach;Yuval Elovici	2010	2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security	10.1109/CIS.2010.95	statistical classification;erbium;keystroke dynamics;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;data mining;authorization;world wide web;computer security;biometrics	Mobile	-50.73520673013126	6.379803899505859	197167
f695043b1995f390927911ee584a75752ad99bd4	towards multi-functional robot-based automation systems		Multi-functional robot cells will play an important role in smart factories of the future. Equipped with flexible toolings, teams of robots will be able to realize manufacturing processes with growing complexity. However, to efficiently support small batch sizes and a multitude of process variants, powerful software tools are required. This paper illustrates the challenges that developers face in multi-functional robot cells, using the example of CFRP production. The vision of a new programming environment for such future flexible automation systems is sketched.	audio feedback;automation;computer-aided design;distributed manufacturing;dynamic language runtime;integrated development environment;lars bak (computer programmer);multi-function printer;prototype;robot;schmidt decomposition	Andreas Angerer;Michael Vistein;Alwin Hoffmann;Wolfgang Reif;Florian Krebs;Manfred Schönheits	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)		control engineering;mobile robot;robot learning;simulation;engineering;process automation system;ubiquitous robot;personal robot;totally integrated automation;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	-54.651297402177015	10.93474933967382	197404

However, the threat of spoofing has raised palpable security concerns. In this paper, we examined a recently introduced novel behavioral biometrics technique, namely, fingerprint dynamics. The technique exploits individual’s behavioral characteristics observed from multi-instance finger scan events. The objective of this investigation was to study the spoof resistance capabilities of the fingerprint dynamics-based standalone identity verification system. We used a custom-built hardware unit to collect biometric samples from a total of 50 participants, in an environment that closely mimics the operational scenario. Data collection was done in several sessions per user, spread over a period of seven weeks. We performed an exhaustive analysis of several time-derived features, and selected a combination of best-performing features using genetic algorithm. We also conducted a systematic evaluation using support vector machine and  $k$ -nearest neighbor classifiers. We performed a series of verification experiments under three different and practically relevant attack scenarios, namely: 1) combined zero-effort and active imposter; 2) only zero-effort imposter; and 3) only active imposter. We find that the proposed technique exhibits promising results under all the three attack scenarios.	biometrics;experiment;fingerprint;genetic algorithm;identity verification service;support vector machine;synapomorphy	Ishan Bhardwaj;Narendra D.
