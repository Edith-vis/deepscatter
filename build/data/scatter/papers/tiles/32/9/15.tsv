03df32b0960a8aa31cfff844f2bb4105a72b8a1f	guest editorial - simulation for training foundations and techniques	guest editorial	Simulation is generally used for three purposes: problem solving, training, and education. TOMACS has published papers only on simulation for problem solving. We are pleased to present, for the first time, this issue on Simulation for Training: Foundations and Techniques. Our objective is to broaden the coverage of TOMACS and initiate the publication of trainingrelated simulation papers. During the last decade we have seen a significant increase in the use of modeling and computer simulation for training purposes. This usage is expected to increase even more in the future in military, industry, and education. For the Department of Defense (DoD), simulation remains to be the most cost-effective technique for training military personnel. The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (http://www.dmso.mil) was established to strengthen the use of simulation within the DoD and to promote cooperation among DoD components, to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in the use of simulation for training purposes. As stated in the U.S. Army Modernization Plan (Vol. 2, Annex P, Jan. 1993), “The training vision for the year 2000 and beyond is to produce a seamless simulation environment which allows actual combat systems, manned simulations, and other simulations to exercise on a virtual battlefield.” The ever-increasing use of simulations and simulators for training users and operators of complex systems has far exceeded the capabilities of the current technology. The challenges require not only extensions and advances in current methodologies, but the discovery or creation of innovative approaches and techniques to deal with the rapidly expanding expectations. This issue contains four papers addressing some of the challenges we face today. The first paper, “Performance and Reliability Analysis of Relevance Filtering for Scalable Distributed Interactive Simulation” by Bassiouni et al., deals with one of the major challenges facing the design and implementation of large-scale distributed interactive simulation (DIS) training exercises: meeting the bandwidth and communication requirements. After describing the DIS scalability problem, the authors present five bandwidth reduction techniques: dead-reckoning, relevance filtering, packet bundling, data compression, and quiescent entities. The distributed relevance filtering algorithms are analyzed, performance results are given, implementation considerations are presented, and migration to high-level architecture is discussed. The paper, “Terrain Database Interoperability Issues in Training with Distributed Interactive Simulation” by Schiavone et al., deals with another major challenge facing the design and implementation of DIS training exercises: terrain database correlation problem.

This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients’ vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users’ sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users’ side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way—which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users’ health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.	anytime algorithm;best practice;cloud computing;ftc fair information practice;health insurance portability and accountability act;holism;information privacy;internet;middleware;personalization;privacy law;recommender system;web service	Ahmed M.

Therefore, from academic and industrial viewpoints, increasing attention has been paid to complex vehicle correlative technologies with full consideration of issues like safety, robust performance, impact analysis, optimization, automation, motion control, etc. All aforementioned issues provide a basis for the design and operation of practical vehicle systems in order to achieve desired complex tasks.	optimizing compiler;signal processing	Hamid Reza Karimi;Dario Vangi;Hermann Steffan;Junmin Wang;Kalyana Chakravarthy Veluvolu	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694238	simulation;electrical engineering	Robotics	-53.81949522895457	2.105316007766614	160276
9c6c07d9743c217a092d16cc339f28426a589443	special issue on hierarchical fuzzy systems	fuzzy system	It is well known that fuzzy systems are one of the most successful applications of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic and that these kinds of applications are used in industries as well as all kinds of home appliances. However, the move from simple domains to complex ones increases the difficulty of building such systems. In particular, established techniques, such as the development of a flat set of rules, becomes inadequate, and new ones are being developed. This special issue of the International Journal of Intelligent Systems is devoted to hierarchical fuzzy systems, one promising technique for dealing with complex domains. The first two articles of this issue describe architectures of hierarchical fuzzy systems and some applications using these hierarchies. In the first article, Tunstel, de Oliveira, and Berman present an approach to hierarchical control design and synthesis. Details of their theoretical framework as well as discussions of practical design and implementation issues are given. ThenMagdalena describes a different architecture. The idea is to use the output of a level as a method to modify the control surface of the next level. The approach is based on the use of contextual information. While in the first two articles, the architecture of the system is built by domain experts, in the third one it is not. Tachibana and Furuhashi present a method to build the system (both the architecture and its rules) from examples. The next article by Kikuchi and Takagi describes the limitations of hierarchical systems. They show that not all functions can be decomposed using hierarchies with disjoint variables. The issue concludes with an article that reviews some of the latest results on hierarchical fuzzy systems and their construction. To finish this introduction, I thank the referees for their cooperation and Prof. Ronald Yager, editor of this journal, for providing me with the opportunity to edit this issue.	audio control surface;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;subject-matter expert	Vicenç Torra	2002	Int.

The availability of embedded and mobile smart computing systems opens new roads for the management of land and infrastructures by civil protection operators. To date, research has explored the use of social networks for the management of disasters connected to meteorological/hydrogeological events or earthquakes, but without emphasis on the importance of an integrated system. The main feature of the Whistland system proposed in this paper is to make synergistic use of augmented reality (AR), crowd-mapping (CM), social networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSN) by exploiting technologies and frameworks of Web 2.0 and GIS 2.0 to make informed decisions about the chain of events. The Whistland system is composed of a geo-server, a mobile application with AR and an analytics dashboard. The geo-server acts as the hub of the sensor and social networks. The abstracted concept in this sense is the transformation of the user domain into “intelligent sensors” for the whole scope of crisis management. The social network integration is made through an efficient pointer-like mechanism that keeps the storage requirement low through a mobile application based on an augmented reality engine and provides qualitative information that sensors are unable to capture. Real-time analyses, geo-searches and the capability to examine event histories with an augmented reality engine all help the stakeholders to understand better the state of the resources under observation/monitoring. The system has been extensively tested in the programmed maintenance of river basins, where it is necessary to log maintenance activities in order to keep the riverbank clean: a significant use-case in many countries affected by hydro-geological instability.	3d modeling;augmented reality;decision support system;embedded system;geographic information system;information retrieval;instability;internet of things;knowledge base;mobile app;natural language;plug-in (computing);pointer (computer programming);private network;prototype;real-time transcription;realityengine;sensor;server (computing);social network;synergy;the hub (forum);usb hub;web 2.0	Gioele Luchetti;Adriano Mancini;Mirco Sturari;Emanuele Frontoni;Primo Zingaretti	2017	ISPRS Int.

Companies like IBM and Cadence developed their in-house model checkers, and acted as driving forces behind the design of the IEEE-standardized temporal logic PSL. On the other hand, model checking C-, C#and .NETprogram code is an intensive research topic at, for instance, Microsoft and NASA. In this short paper, we briefly discuss three non-standard applications of model checking. The first example is taken from systems biology and shows the relevance of probabilistic reachability. Then, we show how to determine the optimal scheduling policy for multiple-battery systems so as to optimize the system’s lifetime. Finally, we discuss a stochastic job scheduling problem that —thanks to recent developments— can be solved using model checking.	computer hardware;job scheduler;model checking;reachability;relevance;scheduling (computing);software bug;software engineering;systems biology;temporal logic	Mehdi Jazayeri TU Wien	1991		10.1007/978-3-642-29320-7	operations research	SE	-54.33607336671447	0.8270827474505915	164892

For the first time, a workshop in the tradition of the software-pattern conference series (e.g. PLoP, EuroPLoP) was held jointly with the European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2014) in Vienna, Austria. The main objective of this workshop called MiniPLoP was to bring software architecture researchers closer to the pattern community and to introduce the writers' workshop format to them. Writers' workshop at PLoP conferences provide authors of pattern papers with high-density feedback given by peers within a limited timeframe. In addition, our workshop provided a forum to reect on the state of software architecture patterns and to discuss advances pattern research. This report contains an extended keynote abstract and summaries of the papers discussed during the workshop.	plop;software architecture;software design pattern	Neil B.

MSE fills a critical niche in enabling microelectronic systems educators to share in this excitement and exchange ideas on how to best prepare future microelectronics engineers. We challenge each other and our students to ever greater contributions. MSE’05 fulfills this mission by attracting valuable intellectual contributions from around the world and by providing a rare venue for microelectronic systems educators to focus on connecting with each other. Once again, MSE has a powerful lineup of invited speakers, technical papers, posters, and industry participants. Invited speakers include Reiner Hartenstein, University of Kaiserslautern; Mani Srivastava, University of California, Los Angeles; and Ralph Cavin, Semiconductor Research Corporation. Technical papers and posters from around the world provide useful examples and tools for improving microelectronics curricula, intensive teaching of system-on-a-chip (SoC) design, advancing the use of FPGAs, developing university and industry partnerships, teaching design verification, and the using system-level design tools. This will be the second year for an EDA panel session with representatives from top EDA vendors focused on improving the utilization and effectiveness of EDA software in the university environment. I thank the program committee (PC) for their diligence in identifying the highest quality papers for MSE’05 and for providing feedback for refinement of those papers. Each PC member reviewed from four to six papers, providing their comments and evaluations anonymously through an electronic conference management system. This enabled the organizing committee to efficiently select excellent papers that will be of the greatest interest to MSE participants. MSE will meet again in 2007, with paper submissions due in January 2007. Please consider how you might contribute to the ongoing vitality of MSE through future papers, serving on the program committee, and helping with the organization of MSE.	content management system;electronic system-level design and verification;field-programmable gate array;level design;media source extensions;niche blogging;organizing (structure);refinement (computing);semiconductor research corporation;system on a chip;venue (sound system)	Mark C.

5bef444f6a06c968e9834dbb764fb80a0bde6067	guest editorial for the special issue on source code analysis and manipulation, scam 2012	scam 2012;source code manipulation;source code analysis	This issue of the Journal of Software: Evolution and Practice concentrates on the bottom line in computer software engineering—the source code itself. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is directed toward other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only complete and precise description of the behavior of the system. The analysis and manipulation of source code thus remains a pressing concern. The three papers in this issue were selected and extended from the best papers presented at the 12th IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2012) held in Riva del Garda, Italy, in September 2012. The aim of the SCAM conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on the theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. It is the source code that contains the only truly precise description of the behavior of such systems. Many other conferences and workshops address the applications of source code analysis and manipulation. The aim of SCAM is to focus on the algorithms, tools, and techniques of source code analysis and manipulation themselves—what they can achieve and how they can be improved, refined, and combined. The SCAM 2012 conference received 40 regular paper submissions of outstanding quality, of which 16 papers were selected for presentation after review by at least three referees for relevance, soundness, and originality. For this special issue, seven of the very best of these were invited to submit extended and revised papers. However, this special issue was not meant to be closed only to invited papers. A public open call was published to invite outstanding papers by other authors on source code analysis and manipulation. In total, seven papers were submitted to this special issue. Each of the submissions was reviewed by a minimum of three expert referees. Following the first round of review, five papers were selected for final consideration in this special issue. The authors were asked to revise their papers in response to the referees’ comments, and the revised drafts were then reviewed for a second time for conformance to the referees’ comments. Following this second review, three papers were selected for publication in this special issue. The selected papers represent some of the very best work that has appeared at SCAM, and cover all of its main areas of interest, namely program transformation, represented by Chris Wilcox, Michelle Mills Strout, and James M. Bieman; feature location, represented by André L. Santos; and impact analysis, represented by Lajos Schrettner, Judit Jász, Tamás Gergely, Árpád Beszédes, and Tibor Gyimóthy. In the first paper, ‘An optimization-based approach to LUT program transformations’, Wilcox et al. present an approach to cope with the trade-off between performance and accuracy. In computational software, programmers may replace calls to mathematical primitives (especially trigonometric formulas) with accesses to tables that use precomputed data (look-up tables (LUT)). However, when this alternative design is adopted, it involves substantial manual effort that is prone to programming error. This paper presents an automatic approach to refactor a scientific-computation program to a program that uses LUT. The trade-off between speed and accuracy in using LUT is addressed as a multi-objective optimization problem. The paper by André L. Santos, ‘GUI Code Tracing Through Direct Program Interaction’, presents a novel approach to feature location in Graphical User Interface (GUI) code, that is, the identification of the portions of the program that are executed when a graphical widget is triggered.

Medical institutions moved towards this solution in order to improve the quality of care, by providing easier access to information, at lower costs. However, the downside of EHR is represented by the storage requirements which could include physicians orders, prescriptions, lab results, X-rays, MRIs. In this paper we propose an efficient storage solution by analyzing and taking into consideration the requirements of e-Health applications (such as computational time, storage, processing time, costs) and important aspects of data replication strategies (such as data priority, price, data size).	algorithm;chunking (computing);data center;freedom of information laws by country;locality of reference;merkle tree;region of interest;replication (computing);requirement;routing;throughput;time complexity	Andreea Pintilie;Elena Simona Apostol;Ciprian Dobre	2016	2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)	10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901566	computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	HPC	-48.880070805997555	3.809611651860078	168750

The purpose of the simulator is to provide a tool for study of the various aspects of an OASIS network and to gain a strong intuitive feel for its operations. For a specified simulation period, the OASISNET simulator reproduces an OASIS network of multiple nodes using the same communications medium as the actual system, the Internet, and with multiple players using the simulator simultaneously. Salient features of the simulator are its modular architecture, the ability to simulate multi-node OASIS network operations and to accept simultaneous access from remote users through use of clienrlserver technology. The simulation focuses on the dissemination and use of the available transmission capability information. Sample applications of the new simulator are discussed.	advanced transportation controller;client–server model;e-services;information system;modular programming;server (computing);simulation;web;web application	Yong Tian;George Gross	1997		10.1109/HICSS.1997.663227	embedded system;computer architecture simulator;simulation;computer science;operating system;database;power system simulator for engineering;law;world wide web;computer security;information system	Mobile	-50.353051859367994	4.161044951726279	169565

They are used in a very wide array of application areas including transport, consumer electronics / electrical appliances, energy distribution, manufacturing systems, etc. Designing embedded systems requires techniques taking into account extra-functional requirements regarding optimal use of resources such as time, memory and energy while ensuring autonomy, reactivity and robustness. Jointly taking into account these requirements raises a grand scientific and technical challenge: extending Computer Science with paradigms and methods from Control Theory and Electrical Engineering. Computer Science is based on discrete computation models, which are by their nature are very different from the analytic models used in other engineering disciplines, because they do not encompass physical time and resources.

77ebd4331d3e98b6b6e5d353e42a6d258fe34020	a brief history of the ieee transactions on computers	ieee publishing history;ieee publishing;history	THE IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Computer Society has traced its origin to the formation of the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers) Large-Scale Computing Devices Committee (CDC) during May and June 1946, which was formally approved by the AIEE Board of Directors on January 29, 1948. The IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) Professional Group on Electronic Computers (PGEC) was formed on September 14, 1951, which was formally approved by the IRE Board of Directors on October 19, 1951. The AIEE CDC and the IRE PGEC were the roots of the IEEE Computer Society. After the merger of the AIEE and the IRE to form the IEEE in 1963, the AIEE CDC and the IRE PGEC were combined to form the IEEE Computer Group on April 22, 1964, which became the IEEE Computer Society in January 1971. Accordingly the IEEE Computer Society is celebrating its 65th Anniversary in 2011. Likewise the IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC) has traced its origin to the inaugural publication of the IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers in December 1952, with Werner Buchholz as Editor and Jean Felker and James Weiner comprising the Editorial Board. The inaugural issue (PGEC-1) contained papers on computers from WESCON (the Western Electronic Show and Convention), held at Long Beach, California, on August 27-29, 1952. The IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers began as a quarterly publication and became a bimonthly publication in January 1962. After the merger of the AIEE and the IRE in 1963, it became the IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers in August 1963 (Volume EC-12, Number 4). Since January 1968 (Volume C-17, Number 1), it has become the current IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC) and a monthly publication. The inception of the IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers in 1952 had undoubtedly contributed much to the IRE Computer Group’s visibility and stability. The early formative years saw a succession of outstanding editors, beginning with Werner Buchholz in 1952, Ralph Meagher in 1954, John (Jack) Nash in 1957, Howard Tompkins in 1959, and Arnold Cohen in 1961. The position of associate editor was introduced in April 1961, the fi rst one being John (Jack) Sherman who was appointed to cover the area of analog and hybrid computers; also the name of editor was changed to editor-in-chief. The IEEE Transactions on (Electronic) Computers continued to develop under the editorship of Norman Scott (1963) and Harry Huskey (1965). With expanded breadth of technical coverage, the number of annual pages increased from about 800 in 1962 to nearly 1,400 in 1970. A special 25th Anniversary issue of TC was guest edited by Harry Huskey and published in 1976. It contained state-of-the-art surveys and tutorial presentations, and high-quality papers on emerging computing technology were brought together to present a comprehensive view of developments and evolution of concepts, education, languages, and peripherals in the computer fi eld. The special issue published 18 papers authored by 26 leading experts in their areas of interest. A chronological list of editors/editors-in-chief of TC with years of their appointments is listed as follows. 1. Werner Buchholz, 1952 2. Ralph Meagher, 1954 3. John Nash, 1957 4.

Version 7.2 of the language was released in August of 1985 and is being considered by the IEEE as a prime candidate for standardization. It is expected that a proposed standard based on Version 7.2 will be available in January of 1987. This standard will be accompanied by a VHDL Tutorial containing extensive examples of the use of the language for hardware design. Activities in the defense and commercial sectors are well underway in order to develop tools targeted to VHDL. These tools include behavioral simulators and synthesis tools, as well as schematic and syntax-directed editors. This paper provides an overview of the VHDL language and technology, reports the status of the various VHDL tools that are under development, and discusses the future of VHDL.	hardware description language;information system;physical design (electronics);requirement;schematic;simulation;structure editor;systems design;vhdl	Moe Shahdad	1986	23rd ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference	10.1145/318013.318063	embedded system;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;simulated annealing;procurement;electronic design automation;vhdl;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;software engineering;hardware description language;programming language;standardization;algorithm;monte carlo method;computer engineering	EDA	-49.75871567452548	-1.6771183060712413	171619

At the same time the lab also provides the features of a virtual lab, i.e. students conduct experiments on simulators. Both modes of the lab are run under a common user interface. This lab is suited especially for distance education, as students can develop and test their code offline, while still conducting their experiments on real hardware. This lab is thought to replace a traditional lab course where students had to be present on campus for one week full-time, which is quite difficult to realize in distance education.	experiment;microprocessor;online and offline;simulation;user interface	Helmut Bähring;Jörg Keller;Wolfram Schiffmann	2004		10.1145/1275571.1275603	distance education;simulation;computer science;operating system;multimedia;user interface;pipeline	HCI	-53.66468958449796	4.105782989271399	171955

Designing, planning and creating a virtual laboratory can be a very difficult process, which can get even more complicated if the laboratory has to provide access to real equipment. One of the most problematic steps when developing such virtual laboratories is the selection of the right access method. At the present moment of time there are many technologies that allow users to access devices remotely. One of these possible solutions is to use the Telnet/SSH protocols for remote access. Nevertheless, the use of these protocols require at least one active network interface per device, which in some cases can present a problem. There are some other drawbacks of using Telnet/SSH for remote access as well - virtual laboratories are often created with the purpose to be used in the education process, which means that the users of these systems in most cases are students. These less experienced users might accidently delete the configuration of the interface that is dedicated for the remote access, which will result in the immediate loss of connection to the device and will require administrator intervention to fix this access issue. An alternative solution to provide remote access is to use a console server. A detailed analysis on the possibilities for remote access using console servers, present them as reliable, but also as a very expensive solutions. In this paper we will investigate the possibilities to replace the expensive console servers with much cheaper devices. One such device is the Raspberry Pi - a low cost device that was developed to enhance the education process of children and students in the field of the computer sciences and their related subjects. In this paper we will investigate and compare the characteristics of the Raspberry Pi to the most widely used console servers and we will present a way to use the Raspberry Pi as a console server for remote access to telecommunication routers and switches.	computer science;general-purpose input/output;microcomputer;network interface;network switch;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);remote desktop software;server (computing);system administrator;terminal server;usb	Diyana Kyuchukova;Georgi V.

The range of applications and requirements is broad. Consequently, our research objective are overlay networks which organize and adapt themselves at runtime. This article describes the current state of our project and gives an overview of the steps envisioned. We briefly show the necessity for self-organization in overlay networks. Based on our experience, we then provide a list of overlay network system parameters relevant for dynamic adjustment. When designing mechanisms for self-adaptation for overlay networks, we have observed implementationlevel interference and semantic-level interference. To deal with these phenomena, the overlay network architecture envisioned (1) must separate functionality for self-organization and system core functionality and (2) should preserve system integrity. To achieve this, we propose to use self-tuning mechanisms with explicit preand postconditions and conflict resolution as well as reflection. We discuss alternative implementation techniques and present one concrete approach based on AspectOriented Programming and Mixin Layers. We conclude with first insights into organic overlay networks and emergent behavior.	algorithm;aspect-oriented programming;aspectj;cp/m;computer graphics;content addressable network;ecoop;emergence;experiment;fosd mixin layers;flocking (behavior);heart rate variability;holography;interference (communication);internet;java;just-in-time compilation;kelly criterion;lookup table;mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory;middleware;network architecture;organizing (structure);overlay network;peer-to-peer;peter stoica;postcondition;procedural programming;requirement;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);self-organization;self-tuning;social system;swarm intelligence;system integrity;the art of the metaobject protocol;warren abstract machine	Sven Apel;Klemens Böhm	2005			self-organization;overlay network;aspect-oriented programming;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;conflict resolution;peer-to-peer;database;distributed computing;emergence;system integration	OS	-49.68621434258596	2.8559664618589684	174124

4318b7c494545247e442865da57ce0f09c41debd	automated driving		In the last 30 years, automated driving has been a challenging research topic. However, despite tremendous improvements in sensor technology, pattern recognition techniques, control system design, computation power, communication bandwidth, and other system technology areas, market introduction of a fully automated vehicle that is capable of unsupervised driving in any environment remains a long-term goal. Nevertheless, driver assistance systems supporting human drivers have already enteredmodern passenger vehicles and trucks. These include advanced driver assistance systems providing collision protection functions as well as reliable comfort assistance features like distance and lane keeping support. Low speed functions like parking assistance or automated stop & go driving add to this picture. More and more sophisticated systems enhancing comfort, efficiency and safety will be introduced on path towards fully automated vehicles. While this development will take place in an evolutionary process, many experts expect revolutionary changes in human transportation towards its completion. Thus it comes at no surprise that automated driving has attracted considerable attention of the public, the scientific community, and last not least of the industry recently. The pace of innovation in this field has dramatically been enhanced since then. For many stakeholders, automated driving has become an important goal of driver assistance systems development. Almost the entire vehicle industry as well as some noteworthy computer industry players focus on that goal. Numerous announcements of a technological breakthrough and of market introduction in just a couple of years have been claimed in the last decade. This development has motivated this special issue on automated driving.

Like a treasure-hunt, the EXTraS project is harvesting the hitherto unexplored temporal domain information buried in the serendipitous data collected by the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument onboard the ESA XMM-Newton, in 16 years of observations. Part of this analysis is performed through a dedicated science gateway, the EXTraS portal, whose initial release is the subject of this paper. In particular the focus is on its light software architecture, based on the use of microservices, providing a better resilience and more decoupled development lifecycle with respect to the approaches followed by the most used science gateway toolkits.

In this paper we will talk about two major initiatives within advanced SEI capabilities that address risk driven engineering and integration challenges posed from a CAS like environment. The first initiative is based on the use of an advanced Conops development and modelling approach implemented through a CONOPS Simulator concept. Next initiative outlines advanced applications of Reference Architectures (RA’s) as it relates to system design activities within a CAS environment. These initiatives are applied as the foundation for a risk adverse design within CAS Enterprises. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1e90a41f10792df241ee225311643a367c7d3757	special issue on software verification and testing (sac-svt'15)		Software drives today's world. Daily needs like electricity supply, transportation , groceries, are all empowered by software, and not to mention communication and emails. This dependency will only increase, given innovations like the Internet-of-things, 3D printing, self-driving cars and drones. Therefore, software correctness is more important than ever: nobody wants drones to drop on our heads, autonomous cars to crash, or intrudes to enter our house via Internet-of-things devices. Hence, rigorous verification and testing is of paramount importance , as a technique to assess and improve the quality of software systems. This is exactly the topic of the Software Verification and Testing (SVT) track of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing. This special issue of the Journal on Science of Computer Programming arose from the SVT track at the 30 th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, held in Salamanca, Spain on April 13-17, 2015. The track received 60 full paper submissions. After a careful reviewing process, the international Program Committee decided to select 14 papers for presentation during the symposium and inclusion in the SAC'15 proceedings. From these 14 papers, the six best papers were selected and invited for an extended version to this special issue. These extended papers went again through a rigorous peer review process; five papers were finally accepted and are included in this special issue. The papers included here provide key insights on different formal verification and testing approaches.		Gwen Salaün;Mariëlle Stoelinga	2016	Sci. Comput.

d9b2719f9450cbe6b59b495c2beb275653785500	community cloud architecture to improve use accessibility with security compliance in health big data applications		The adoption of big data analytics in healthcare applications is overwhelming not only because of the huge volume of data being analyzed, but also because of the heterogeneity and sensitivity of the data. Effective and efficient analysis and visualization of secure patient health records are needed to e.g., find new trends in disease management, determining risk factors for diseases, and personalized medicine. In this paper, we propose a novel community cloud architecture to help clinicians and researchers to have easy/increased accessibility to data sets from multiple sources, while also ensuring security compliance of data providers is not compromised. Our cloud-based system design configuration with cloudlet principles ensures application performance has high-speed processing, and data analytics is sufficiently scalable while adhering to security standards (e.g., HIPAA, NIST). Through a case study, we show how our community cloud architecture can be implemented along with best practices in an ophthalmology case study which includes health big data (i.e., Health Facts database, I2B2, Millennium) hosted in a campus cloud infrastructure featuring virtual desktop thin-clients and relevant Data Classification Levels in storage.

Due to their complexity such services are currently only provided by large organizations that use their own proprietary specifications thus leaving the full potential untapped. As seen during the development of the World Wide Web a tremendous growth can be achieved by enabling end-users to create services on their own. In this paper we present a platform independent markup language comprising a tool box of standard functions allowing end-users to easily design and exchange innovative location-based services. Besides its simplicity it also enables larger organizations to describe more sophisticated location-based services and run them on different platforms. The language supports event based triggers, like entering a zone, as well as temporal constraints, flow control and stateful services. The created code is human readable thus its executed actions are completely transparent to the user. It is interpreted by a generic parser on the mobile device managing the positioning process and performing actions like notifying the user or executing 3rd party applications.	database trigger;declarative programming;human-readable medium;location-based service;markup language;mobile device;state (computer science);world wide web	Johannes Martens;Ulrich Bareth	2009		10.1145/1710035.1710073	computer science;operating system;mobile technology;location-based service;flow control;data mining;mobile device;pound;database;markup language;services computing;control flow;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Web+IR	-52.57479170653907	2.7400828140124496	191746

The NSF invests in people, ideas, and tools and in particular is a major investor in basic research to produce communication and information technology (ICT) as well as its use in supporting basic research and education in most all areas of science and engineering. The NSF through its Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) has provided substantial funding for high-end computing resources, initially by awards to five supercomputer centers and later through $70 M per year investments in two partnership alliances for advanced computation infrastructures centered at the University of Illinois and the University of California, San Diego. It has also invested in an array of complementary R&D initiatives in networking, middleware, digital libraries, collaboratories, computational and visualization science, and distributed terascale grid environments.	computation;cyberinfrastructure;digital library;ibm notes;information and computer science;information science;library (computing);middleware;supercomputer;terascale (microarchitecture)	Daniel E.

909f12ac3327bc5f9d79927865c2f940fefe58ff	statistical disclosure control for micro-data using the r package sdcmicro	micro data;confidentiality;statistical disclosure control;r	The demand for high quality microdata for analytical purposes has grown rapidly among researchers and the public over the last few years. In order to respect existing laws on data privacy and to be able to provide microdata to researchers and the public, statistical institutes, agencies and other institutions may provide masked data. Using our flexible software tools with which one can apply protection methods in an exploratory manner, it is possible to generate high quality confidential (micro-)data. In this paper we present highly flexible and easy to use software for the generation of anonymized microdata and give insights into the implementation and the design of the R-Package sdcMicro. R is a highly extendable system for statistical computing and graphics, distributed over the net. sdcMicro contains almost all popular methods for the anonymization of both categorical and continuous variables. Furthermore, several new methods have been implemented. The package can also be used for the comparison of methods and for measuring the information loss and disclosure risk of the masked data.	command-line interface;computational statistics;confidentiality;data anonymization;data masking;display resolution;extensibility;goto;graphical user interface;graphics;information privacy;microdata (html);smart data compression;statistical disclosure control;test data	Matthias Templ	2008	Trans.
