Not only the number of devices increases due to the advancing computerization of every days life, but also the storage capacity of each and every device raises into multi-terabyte storage requirements per case for forensic working images. In this paper we improve the standardized forensic process by proposing to use file deduplication across devices as well as file white listing rigorously in investigations, to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored for analysis as early as during data acquisition. These improvements happen in an automatic fashion and completely transparent to the forensic investigator. They furthermore be added without negative effects to the chain of custody or artefact validity in court, and are evaluated in a realistic use case.	computer file;data acquisition;data deduplication;fundamental fysiks group;gigabyte;requirement;terabyte;whitelist	Sebastian Neuner;Martin Mulazzani;Sebastian Schrittwieser;Edgar R.

e806b6b4d91cb4ec514eaf13df3918cfe22fa1c9	qr code security: a survey of attacks and challenges for usable security	hci;qr codes;usability;security	QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes with the ability to encode different types of information. Because of their high information density and robustness, QR codes have gained popularity in various fields of application. Even though they offer a broad range of advantages, QR codes pose significant security risks. Attackers can encode malicious links that lead e.g. to phishing sites. Such malicious QR codes can be printed on small stickers and replace benign ones on billboard advertisements. Although many real world examples of QR code based attacks have been reported in the media, only little research has been conducted in this field and almost no attention has been paid on the interplay of security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we describe the manifold use cases of QR codes. Furthermore, we analyze the most significant attack scenarios with respect to the specific use cases. Additionally, we systemize the research that has already been conducted and identified usable security and security awareness as the main research challenges. Finally we propose design requirements with respect to the QR code itself, the reader application and usability aspects in order to support further research into to making QR code processing both secure and usable.	authentication;barcode;encode;fundamental fysiks group;human–computer interaction (security);information design;layer (electronics);malware;phishing;printing;qr code;requirement;security awareness;smartphone;social engineering (security);usability;vector (malware)	Katharina Krombholz;Peter Frühwirt;Peter Kieseberg;Ioannis Kapsalis;Markus Huber;Edgar R.

However, it is clearly inadequate in a world where increasing numbers of systems and services require people to authenticate in a shared space, while being actively observed. This new reality places pressure on a password mechanism never intended for use in such a context. Asterisks may obfuscate alphanumeric characters on entry but popular systems, e.g. Apple iPhone and Nintendo Wii, regularly require users to use an on-screen keyboard for character input. This may not be a real concern within the context of secluded space but inadvertly reveals a secret within shared space. Such a secret has an economic cost in terms of replacement, recall and revenue, all of which affect the financial return of the offending systems and services. In this paper, we present and evaluate a graphical authentication mechanism, Tetrad, which appears to have the potential to address these specific concerns.	authentication;nibble;password;virtual keyboard;wii remote plus	Karen Renaud;Joseph Maguire	2009		10.1145/1671011.1671061	computer science;advertising;communication;computer security	HCI	-51.74873535291522	64.40444667593826	184019

Work has been done in the past detailing the reverse engineering of proprietary file systems and on the process of recovering data from CCTV systems. However, if given a disk image without the CCTV system itself, or if under time constraints, the task becomes much more difficult. This paper explains a different approach to recovering the data and how to make sense of data on a CCTV disk. The method does not require extensive reverse engineering of the CCTV system, or even to have access to the CCTV system itself.	closed-circuit television;reverse engineering	Lee Tobin;Ahmed F.

In particular, due to the intrinsic interdependence and ubiquitous connectivity of modern communication systems, adversaries can devise malware that propagates through intermediate hosts to approach the target, to which we refer as transmissive attacks. Inspired by biology, the transmission pattern of such an attack in the digital space much resembles the spread of an epidemic in real life. This article describes transmissive attacks, summarizes the utility of epidemic models in communication systems, and draws connections between transmissive attacks and epidemic models. Simulations, experiments, and ongoing research challenges on transmissive attacks are also addressed.	british informatics olympiad;computer simulation;experiment;interdependence;intrinsic dimension;malware;real life	Pin-Yu Chen;Ching-Chao Lin;Shin-Ming Cheng;Hsu-Chun Hsiao;Chun-Ying Huang	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7497770	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Security	-54.76516797393909	66.09477443098577	184293

In the virtual world, they enable secure interaction by controlling access to shared resources. Yet relying on them to support synchronous direct interactions, such as face-to-face meetings, might be suboptimal as they require reliable online connectivity and even then often introduce delays. A much more efficient way of co-located resource sharing is the use of local communications, such as ad-hoc WiFi. Yet setting up the necessary encryption and authentication mechanisms is often cumbersome. In this paper, we present PIKE, a key exchange protocol that minimizes this configuration effort. PIKE piggybacks the exchange of keys on top of an existing service infrastructure. To support encryption or authentication without Internet connection, PIKE relies on triggers for upcoming personal interactions and exchanges keys before they take place. To evaluate PIKE, we present two example applications and we perform an experimental as well as an analytical analysis of its characteristics. The evaluation indicates that PIKE is broadly applicable, scales well enough to support larger events and provides a level of security that is (at least) comparable to the one provided by the underlying service.	application programming interface;authentication;database trigger;dropbox;e-services;encryption;gambas;google+;hoc (programming language);interaction;internet;key exchange;malware;middleware;mobile device;pike;scalability;virtual world	Wolfgang Apolinarski;Marcus Handte;Muhammad Umer Iqbal;Pedro José Marrón	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)	10.1109/PerCom.2013.6526719	embedded system;the internet;key exchange;computer science;operating system;cryptographic protocol;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.88302051494879	67.29344782078495	185740

With the popularity of smartphones, the privacy of smartphone users are challenged by various malware and attacks. A large amount of malware has been developed and spread such as Soundcomber, Screenmilker, TouchLogger, and so on. In addition, some smartphone attacks are based on physical access to the phone like smudge attacks. All these have reminded current users to pay more attention for smartphone security such as installing anti-malware software to defend against malicious apps, which may reduce the effectiveness of most malware.  In this paper, we identify a vulnerability of smartphone charging and design a new type of charging attacks (called juice filming attacks) based on a standard USB connector and HDMI, which can steal users' secrets through automatically video-capturing their inputs (e.g., unlock patterns, PIN code). The efficiency of our designed attacks relies on the observations that users are not aware of any risk when charging their phones in public places and that most users would interact with their phone during the charging. Different from other malware and attacks, our designed juice filming attacks possess six major features: 1) be simple but quite efficient; 2) user unawareness; 3) does not need to install any apps on phone's side; 4) does not need to ask for any permissions; 5) cannot be detected by any current anti-malware software; 6) can be scalable and effective in both Android OS and iOS. To implement this attack, we employ a VGA/RGB frame grabber and further conduct several user studies to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of our attacks. Based on the understanding, we later propose several mitigation strategies to defend against such attacks.	android;frame grabber;hdmi;malware;mobile security;operating system;physical access;sim lock;scalability;smartphone;video graphics array;ios	Weizhi Meng;Lee Wang Hao;Murali Srirangam Ramanujam;S.

cdb8c6f63e02843a86cb0b3f6e7efa28c6da1997	visual question authentication protocol (vqap)		Abstract Many conventional methods exist to authenticate a user, including text-based systems and graphical systems. While text-based authentication is secure, it is difficult for users to remember very robust passwords. Conversely, while graphical-based passwords that require selection of a “correct” image against “incorrect” (or distractor) ones have proven easier to remember, they are vulnerable to an attacker exploiting direct access to the selection (shoulder-surfing) or prior knowledge about the user. In this work, we propose a novel authentication method that combines both graphical-based and text-based features that seeks to mitigate these risks. Our system, Visual Question Authentication Protocol (VQAP) offers enhanced security by introducing (1) a question about a registered image as a cue for a text-based password, (2) a novel machine-learning based classifier for selecting distractor images that are related (or relevant) to the given question, and (3) multiple authentication scenarios, some of which present incorrect information that only the true user should be able to identify. We present experiments for our classifier that validate our ability to separate relevant and irrelevant images suitably for authentication purposes, given a question.	authentication protocol	Andeep S.

Using craftier techniques, more Web scam artists are grabbing consumers’ personal and financial data this year than ever before. One popular new scheme, called “phishing” or “spoofing,” targets unsuspecting consumers with emails and bogus Web sites purported to be from established companies such as electronics store Best Buy, which experienced a spoof scam in June. Here’s how it worked: Consumers received emails informing them of suspicious online transactions and advising them to visit a Best Buy “fraud department” Web page. The page asked users to provide confidential information to prove their identities and make or cancel the purchase in question. The emails and Web page were fake, of course, but some customers fell into the trap. EBay, PayPal, America Online, Mindspring, and a few banks have been hit with similar spoof scams, which asked users to update personal information or preferences. The emails often contain look-alike company logos and mask the sender’s identity. Moreover, the outside Web pages often use URLs that mimic the legitimate company pages. In July, the FBI launched an initiative with Earthlink, the US Federal Trade Commission, and the US National Consumer’s League to publicize spoof scams. “Bogus emails that try to trick customers into giving out personal information are the most troubling new scam on the Internet,” says Jana Monroe, Assistant Director of the FBI’s Cyber Division. At the same time, older scams, such as identity theft and auction fraud, keep on humming. Despite an associated jump in consumer complaints, however, confidence in Web shopping remains strong as businesses, state governments, and law enforcement groups work to find new ways to fight back.	confidentiality;e-commerce;email;internet;list of code lyoko episodes;personally identifiable information;phishing;spoofing attack;web page	Laurianne McLaughlin	2003	IEEE Internet Computing	10.1109/MIC.2003.1232512	web application security;computer science;information security;internet security;database;data security;internet privacy;law;world wide web;computer security;government	Web+IR	-54.78817503262853	63.59292691157513	186318

This could cause problems in certain cases where additional security, privacy and authentication might be desirable before the user is allowed to view the push message, for example a message from the user's bank giving the current bank balance. In this paper we present a Smart Push system that ensures user security and privacy. Our push architecture incorporates a Gateway Client and Gateway Server component, enabling additional security measures and encryption of sent push messages at the gateway server before the messages reach the client device. In our system, a unique subscription Id is generated during the registration process, which hides the actual registration Id of the client device and thus ensures privacy. An additional spam filter at the gateway server further protects the client device from spam push messages. We present the architecture of the system and results of some tests performed to measure the effectiveness of the security aspects of the push architecture.	anti-spam techniques;authentication;email filtering;encryption;privacy;server (computing);spamming	Girija Saride;Jaya Balan Aaron;Joy Bose	2016	2016 8th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2016.7439931	push technology;computer science;information security;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-48.84114523004455	64.65287787444987	186797
876894d4e5bc1665160020d3c5eb8133c04ce23a	are e-mails files reliable evidences?		At a first sketch, the answer is: it depends on the circumstances. There is not a general rule that is always valid. Usually, we consider the e-mails as not trustable at all. They are plain text exchanged between servers without any kind of guarantee. E-mails as evidence are prone to cheating. Both the authenticity and the integrity of a generic e-mail file cannot be verified. The main reason is that the e-mail files could be easily forged. In some circumstances, the forgery could be very subtle and hard to identify. However, in some circumstances, both the authenticity and the integrity can be verified; without resorting to any invasive tool. Several e-mail servers may apply specific spam countermeasures that could help to verify the message. We point out a method to take advantage of these mechanisms for checking some properties of e-mail messages. Moreover, we sketch the conditions of applicability of this method. In some countries, such as in Italy, there is in place a so called Registered e-mail service, that provides by design e-mail integrity, authenticity, and date certainty. In that case no further methods are required.

Finally it was solved. The other interesting thing about this is, we tried it with Writer (which is the Microsoft Word of Open Office), and Writer handled it correctly, so I asked the Open Office people, well did you have a problem with the Writer, and they said, well yes, we did have this vulnerability with the Writer, but we have fixed it. So conceptually they should have done it for the other applications as well because they are the same, and this is again about the honeymoon effect, you just need one “+4”, such as this, and check it with the pertinent applications.	security testing	Saad Aloteibi	2010		10.1007/978-3-662-45921-8_31	computer security;computer science;code coverage;internet privacy;honeymoon;cryptographic protocol;hybrid security;constraint satisfaction problem;vulnerability	Crypto	-53.61436701628777	64.62187459676927	188360

In recent years it has been exacerbated by the arrival of electronic communication and the multitude of ways that communication can be misdirected. A new chapter in this age old problem is being written with the proliferation of top level domains (TLDs). This paper examines this problem in more detail and provides a full analysis of the current set of TLDs. In particular, we are concerned with TLDs that have a non-trivial probability of intercepting traffic intended for another TLD. Intercepting TLDs have the potential of intercepting a lot of traffic since a TLD can support many domain names.	interceptor pattern;internet	George Markowsky	2015	2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications (IDAACS)	10.1109/IDAACS.2015.7340771	the internet;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;information security;theoretical computer science;operating system;data mining;mathematics;processor register;privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-54.08544229800112	64.10813287169759	188500

Access control is the key to all aspects of security, and it is a point that should be well considered by any security team. A common misconception about access control is that is begins and ends with locked doors, and this is sadly mistaken. Access control limits access to specific area of buildings, which house network servers, offices, terminals, and a host of other devices and data that must be protected. PKI would be useful to the Security Professional, as it creates a Web of Trust between all users on the network, and when that trust is violated, only then does the security team have to jump into action. This technique is being used within the medical field and in many research and development departments across the United States, but is not currently in place in the typical office environment. This method would enhance the overall security of a given office network, provide the security teams with an easier network to maintain, and speed up the flow of data within the office environment.	access control;dataflow;encryption;network security;public key infrastructure;server (computing);web of trust	Christopher Woodward;Wasim A.

In general, such contents are securely encrypted in storage. In this paper, however, we demonstrated that the backup database file for chat messages in KakaoTalk (the most popularly used instant messaging service in Republic of Korea, http://www.kakao.com/talk/en) can be leaked to unauthorized users. We carefully examined the backup procedure in KakaoTalk through reverse engineering the KakaoTalk application to analyze how the backup database file was encrypted and the encryption key can be generated. Our analysis showed that the encrypted database is susceptible to off-line password guessing attacks. Based on this finding, we recommend that a secure key generation technique should be designed to improve resistance against offline password guessing attacks by using a random secret number to generate the encryption key.	authorization;backup;database;encryption;instant messaging;key (cryptography);key generation;online and offline;password cracking;provisioning;reverse engineering;security service (telecommunication);video clip	Jusop Choi;Jaewoo Park;Hyoungshick Kim	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)	10.1109/BIGCOMP.2017.7881732	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-50.548307253558	65.52782882075759	189024

If the user must have access to information, but does not require fast access to large amounts of data, the system can release the information to that user in a slow and unhelpful manner. The addition of the parameter of time acts as a deterrent to information collectors and intruders; less information is available, and the user must access the system repeatedly and for a longer time to get it. Investigation of rate of release has led to further understanding of the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege has generally been espoused by the computer security as highly desirable. It has been applied to computer security, but only in limited ways. Considered of time allows a refinement of the concept and offers the possibility of more flexible and fine-grained control.	computer security;freedom of information laws by country;principle of least privilege;refinement (computing)	Ruth Nelson	1995			concrete;risk management;computer science;security policy;information security;national security;resource management;data security;principle of least privilege;internet privacy;information management;telephony;world wide web;computer security	Security	-50.20983558052804	60.66874570528868	189754

To protect the mobile device, its user, and other mobile ecosystem stakeholders such as network operators, application execution is controlled by a platform security architecture. is book explores how such mobile platform security architectures work. We present a generic model for mobile platform security architectures: the model illustrates commonly used security mechanisms and techniques in mobile devices and allows a systematic comparison of different platforms. We analyze several mobile platforms using the model. In addition, this book explains hardware-security mechanisms typically present in a mobile device. We also discuss enterprise security extensions for mobile platforms and survey recent research in the area of mobile platform security. e objective of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of mobile platform security for students, researchers, and practitioners.	computer security;ecosystem;mobile device;mobile security;smartphone	N.

The RFID system has become very popular, with various strengths such as recognition speed and non-touch method. However, there are some problems remaining as the low- cost tag can be operated through query, which leads to information exposure and privacy encroachment. Various approaches have been used to increase security of the system, but the low-cost tag, which has about 5 K-10 K gate capabilities, can only allocate 250-3 K gate to security. Therefore, the current study will provide a reciprocal authentication solution that can be used with low-cost RFID systems, by separating 64 bit keys and minimizing calculations. Existing systems divided a 96 bit key into 4 parts. However, the proposed system reduces the key to 32 bits, and reduces the communications down to 5 from 7. Also, one additional random number is added to the existing two numbers to increase security. To improve the previous system, which only provided XOR calculations, an additional hash function was added. The added procedure does not increase effectiveness, compared to the XOR calculation, but does provide more security to the RFID system, which can be used in remote distances.	32-bit;64-bit computing;code;exclusive or;hash function;mutual authentication;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;random number generation;touch typing	Soo-Young Kang;Im-Yeong Lee	2008	2008 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (mue 2008)	10.1109/MUE.2008.38	radio-frequency identification;data authentication algorithm;message authentication code;hash function;human–computer interaction;challenge–response authentication;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing	Mobile	-49.53098427431613	66.55225506658101	190400
4f143bbd126f9578d8e1d5e8955b634880aee75d	protecting user privacy: an approach for untraceable web browsing history and unambiguous user profiles		The overturning of the Internet Privacy Rules by the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) in late March 2017 allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to collect, share and sell their customersu0027 Web browsing data without their consent. With third-party trackers embedded on Web pages, this new rule has put user privacy under more risk. The need arises for users on their own to protect their Web browsing history from any potential adversaries. Although some available solutions such as Tor, VPN, and HTTPS can help users conceal their online activities, their use can also significantly hamper personalized online services, i.e., degraded utility. In this paper, we design an effective Web browsing history anonymization scheme, PBooster, aiming to protect usersu0027 privacy while retaining the utility of their Web browsing history. The proposed model pollutes usersu0027 Web browsing history by automatically inferring how many and what links should be added to the history while addressing the utility-privacy trade-off challenge. We conduct experiments to validate the quality of the manipulated Web browsing history and examine the robustness of the proposed approach for user privacy protection.	browsing;data anonymization;e-services;embedded system;experiment;https;information sensitivity;internet privacy;personalization;self-replicating machine;tor messenger;tracing (software);tweaking;virtual private network;web page	Ghazaleh Beigi;Ruocheng Guo;Alexander Nou;Yanchao Zhang;Huan Liu	2018	CoRR		the internet;world wide web;web page;service provider;web browsing history;computer security;robustness (computer science);computer science;bittorrent tracker;web navigation	Security	-54.749247230688965	61.63247570760612	190506

A user, (who shall remain nameless) tries to access a document from the IEEE-CS Digital library. His membership has just been renewed and he is trying to login with username and password. His membership card contains identification details such as a name and member number. He also receives a personal identification number (PIN) for authenti-cation. The member name on the card ("""" first name """" ; """" initial of second name """" ; """" surname """") is not the identification required by the system. He must remember that he has used his customary username ("""" initial of first name """" , """" surname """"). He enters this username with the authentication PIN, and the system duly rejects his entry. After selecting a password recovery option, a dialogue asks for several different identification entries—mother's maiden name (duly entered), last four positions of passport number (he wonders what number he had entered there, and duly guesses something plausible), and secret word with an associated hint ("""" wolfie """" , his cat, now what was the word? He duly makes a guess). The system responds with that lovely message """" authentication failed """". Ohh B……..!!, he growls to himself. In the next attempt, he enters his username and the member number from his card, which he had chosen previously as a password that he could at least remember. The system runs incredibly slowly and downloads a mysteriously blank pdf document. After retrying, the system returns a message about the page being currently unavailable. Still unsure about the correctness of his password he gives up in disgust. Sadly this is a story of a relatively IT literate user. What of the myriad others? Do they give up in frustration long before this point? Or, do they by some naïve magic avoid such experiences? There are a number of guidelines and principles for usability that have been violated here, notably: the guideline to """" reduce short term memory load """" [1], and the principle of """" adapting the design to the actual operational conditions and environment in which the system will be deployed """" [2].

Previously, users had to either buy or order content on coded disks. They can now download executable code and applications directly. From the users' viewpoint, this decreases the amount of software stored on their machines. It also lets content providers customize applications by combining different vendors' content. Downloading content from the Internet brings risks: content that appears reputable may be malicious, given system access it can damage or destroy data. To contend with this risk, the author developed FlexxGuard, a flexible interpreter that dynamically derives protection domains and uses those domains to authorize content operations.

The process towards the convergence has been developed to take into account new realities and new perspectives. Along with many positive benefits, there are several security concerns and ensuring privacy is extremely difficult. New security issues make it necessary to rewrite the safety requirements and to know what the risks are and what can be lost. With this paper we want to propose a bio-inspired approach as a result of a comparison between biological models and information security. The risk analysis proposed aims to address technical, human and economical aspects of the security to strategically guide security investments. This analysis requires knowledge of the failure time distribution to assess the degree of system security and analyse the existing countermeasures to decrease the risk, minimise the losses, and successfully manage the security.

ba38fcfdf07a52a2094d3da6289be5115ae408fd	forensic analysis of the windows 7 registry	computer forensics	The recovery of digital evidence of crimes from storage media is an increasingly time consuming process as the capacity of the storage media is in a state of constant growth. It is also a difficult and complex task for the forensic investigator to analyse all of the locations in the storage media. These two factors, when combined, may result in a delay in bringing a case to court. The concept of this paper is to start the initial forensic analysis of the storage media in locations that are most likely to contain digital evidence, the Windows Registry. Consequently, the forensic analysis process and the recovery of digital evidence may take less time than would otherwise be required. In this paper, the Registry structure of Windows 7 is discussed together with several elements of information within the Registry of Windows 7 that may be valuable to a forensic investigator. These elements were categorized into five groups which are system, application, networks, attached devices and the history lists. We have discussed the values of identified elements to a forensic investigator. Also, a tool was implemented to perform the function of extracting these elements and presents them in usable form to a forensics investigator.	categorization;database;microsoft windows;operating system	Khawla Abdulla Alghafli;Andrew Jones;Thomas Anthony Martin	2010	JDFSL		engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer forensics	Web+IR	-52.68588274164217	61.13146427107372	192561

In most cases, the communication between Web browser and e-commerce Web server uses HTTPS protocol. However, the communication often induces some drawbacks, simply denoted by hole. This, in addition, furnishes an opportunity for a hacker to manipulate the data, i.e. decoding the data, using SSL-MITM (SSL Man in the Middle) technique. According to the trials in an experiment with auditor security collection, the results illustrate a hacker and a victim who are on the same local area network; the hacker could be able to decode confidential data (password or credit card number) with the possibility of more than 50 %. This paper presents 3 different methodologies to prevent the decoding using SSL-MITM on the confidential data which normally traverses over e-commerce Web sites. In addition, the evaluation of 3 schemes is conducted to show the degrees of efficiency of the techniques. Furthermore, this information can be preliminarily utilized as a factor to increase the security of e-commerce website.	authorization;backtrack;confidentiality;e-commerce;https;password;server (computing);transport layer security;web server	Thawatchai Chomsiri	2007	21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)	10.1109/AINAW.2007.200	local area network;e-commerce;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	DB	-54.47295268119102	63.589838630696114	192770

Existing social-graph-based defense schemes effectively bound the accepted Sybils to the total number of social connections between Sybils and non-Sybil users. However, Sybils may still evade the defenses by soliciting many social connections to real users. We propose SybilFence, a system that improves over social-graph-based Sybil defenses to furthe r thwart Sybils. SybilFence is based on the observation that even well-maintained fake accounts inevitably receive a si gnificant number of user negative feedback, such as the rejections to their friend requests. Our key idea is to discount th e social edges on users that have received negative feedback, thereby limiting the impact of Sybils’ social edges. The pre liminary simulation results show that our proposal is more resilient to attacks where fake accounts continuously soli cit social connections over time.	negative feedback;simulation;social graph;sybil attack	Qiang Cao;Xiaowei Yang	2012	CoRR		internet privacy;social psychology;world wide web;computer security	Metrics	-55.4641250149754	64.27988176945202	193142

His research covers a broad spectrum of security-related Over the past several years, we have researched how passwords are created, how they resist cracking, and how usable they are. In this article, we focus on recent work in which we tested various techniques that may encourage better password choices. What we found may surprise you. Despite a litany of proposed password replacements, text-based passwords are not going to disappear anytime soon [4]. Passwords have a number of advantages over other authentication mechanisms. They are simple to implement, relatively straightforward to revoke or change, easy for users to understand, and allow for quick authentication; however, passwords also have a number of drawbacks. Foremost among these drawbacks is that it is difficult for users to create and remember passwords that are hard for an attacker to guess. Our research group at Carnegie Mellon University has been investigating strategies to guide users to create passwords that are both secure and memorable. In particular, we have focused on techniques such as password-composition policies and password-strength meters—two of the most ubiquitous strategies employed by system administrators to help users create secure passwords. Although these strategies are commonly used, their effects had not been well understood. Through a series of online studies, we have aimed to understand how password-composition policies and meters affect password security, memorability, and user sentiment. The first step in evaluating the security of a password is to understand the threat model. For instance, one can argue that a password that is hard to guess within the first three or five tries is secure, since an attacker would quickly be locked out. All but the most obvious passwords tend to resist this type of online attack. Passwords have been under attack in other ways due to a spate of password-database compromises in recent years, including at sites like Gawker and …	android;anytime algorithm;authentication;choice behavior;computer science;decision making;foremost;human–computer interaction (security);information design;password cracking;password strength;privacy policy;surgical replantation;system administrator;text-based (computing);threat model;usability	Patrick Gage;Kelley Is An	2012	;login:		advertising;world wide web;computer security	Security	-51.99037282452305	64.7903831257672	194128

To the extent there are vulnerabilities in this software, an attacker may be able to hide or alter the data available to a forensic analyst, causing courts to render judgments based on inaccurate or incomplete evidence. There are a number of legal doctrines designed to ensure that evidence presented to courts is authentic, accurate and reliable, but thus far courts have not applied them with the possibility of security weaknesses in forensic software in mind. This paper examines how courts may react to such claims, and recommends strategies that attorneys and courts can use to ensure that electronic evidence presented in court is both admissible and fair to litigants.	admissible heuristic;arbitrary code execution;encase;fairness measure;hard disk drive;list of digital forensics tools;vulnerability (computing);workstation	Chris K.

The entire system has been designed to be evaluated under the Common Criteria at EAL7, the highest defined level of assurance.  Historically, smart card processors have not supported the hardware protection features necessary to separate the OS from the applications, and one application from another. The Caernarvon OS has taken advantage of the first smart card processors with such features to be the first smart card OS to provide this kind of protection. Even when compared with conventional systems where the hardware protection is routine, the Caernarvon OS is noteworthy, because of the EAL7 assurance.  This approach facilitated implementation of a formally specified, mandatory security policy providing multi-level security (MLS) suitable for both government agencies and commercial users. The mandatory security policy requires effective authentication of its users that is independent of applications. For this reason, the Caernarvon OS also contains a privacy-preserving, two-way authentication protocol integrated with the Mandatory Security Policy.  The Caernarvon OS includes a strong cryptographic library that has been separately certified under the Common Criteria at EAL5+ for use with other systems. The Caernarvon OS implements a secure method for downloading trusted and untrusted application software and data in the field, with the assumption that all applications are potentially hostile. While the initial platform for the operating system was smart cards, the design could also be used in other embedded devices, such as USB tokens, PDAs, cell phones, etc.	authentication protocol;central processing unit;common criteria;cryptography;download;embedded operating system;embedded system;evaluation assurance level;mobile phone;multilevel security;mutual authentication;personal digital assistant;smart card;usb	David C.

While there are millions of applications available in mobile application markets, users often have very little information to rely upon when selecting which applications to download and use in terms behavior and security. Many applications may have the functionality users desire but may also have undesirable behavior such as excessive network usage, use of ads, linkage to malicious sites, or unauthorized leakage of user or application usage information. In this paper, we design a system to provide users with additional information on the application's behavior by actively eliciting and identifying undesirable behavior exhibited by mobile applications. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our system, we use it to study the network behavior of top mobile applications listed in the Android and iOS application markets.

Using our system, users can determine an application's behavior group prior to installation on their mobile devices, reducing the exposure to any undesirable application behavior.	android;authorization;download;linkage (software);mobile app;mobile device;spectral leakage;ios	Wipawee Nayam;Arguy Laolee;Luck Charoenwatana;Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai	2016		10.1145/3012695.3012697	mobile search;computer science;internet privacy;mobile computing;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-54.959401084631644	61.082844508764765	195880

It's common for this to be at least a dozen times, and quite often many more. Wouldn't you prefer to do it only once, when you log into your operating system? This goal is known as single sign-on, a method where a person must only provide authenticating credentials once, and be able to gain access to multiple independent systems in a highly secure manner. Kerberos is the premier technology used to provide single sign-on. The Kerberos protocol, based around a trusted third party and ticket service, is highly robust and efficient. Its use of strong encryption provides a secure method of authentication over an insecure network. As a kerberized application, DB2 uses Kerberos to provide secure authentication.#R##N##R##N#Developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Kerberos is a reference to the three-headed dog named Cerberus that guarded that gates of Hades in ancient Greek mythology. Cerberus, a vicious monster by all accounts, was responsible for ensuring only the souls of people who had died could enter Hades, and that no one could leave. Certainly very vivid imagery for an authentication system. The modern day Kerberos authentication protocol provides a similar level of security, ensuring that clients can authenticate themselves securely to a server or an insecure network, as well as providing options for data integrity and data privacy of any messages exchanged. So not only is Cerberus guarding the gate, it's making sure no one eavesdrops on conversations.#R##N##R##N#A trusted third party, named the Key Distribution Center (KDC) forms the basis of the Kerberos protocol. The KDC shares the encryption keys for all principals making use of Kerberos. One non-traditional aspect of Kerberos is the principal, which is the identity that is either requesting or accepting connections to/from others. Thus servers also have identities and are referenced by their principal name. When a client logs into Kerberos, it contacts the KDC requesting a special ticket called a """"ticket-granting ticket (TGT)"""". Clients authenticate themselves to servers by requesting a service ticket from the KDC, utilizing the TGT previously obtained. The client then passes this ticket to the server as proof of its identity. The server receives the ticket, examines the contents, and based on its trust of the KDC, knows who the client is. All tickets are encrypted with the keys for the appropriate principal so that they can not be tampered with. Tickets have limited lifetimes and Kerberos contains measures to prevent tickets from being re-used. In addition, Kerberos supports mutual authentication whereby a server proves its identity to a client by returning its own ticket to the client. The client is then assured the other end of the communication pipe is who it thinks it is talking to and not someone masquerading as the server. The use of encrypted tickets provides one of the fundamental strengths of the Kerberos protocol, that passwords are never sent over the network or placed in a ticket during day-to-day use. The KDC knows the users password, as does the user, but Kerberos does not require the password to be sent on the network, and there is never a chance for it to fall into the wrong hands or be exposed. The use of encrypted tickets also provides a highly efficient workflow. The KDC does not need to remember state information about which clients are connecting to which servers, or which clients have logged in. It merely examines the contents of the encrypted tickets to make a decision as to whether or not the client has proven its identity or that it should be able to connect to a server. As the KDC is a single-point of failure for all authentication, this simplified protocol allows for a very robust and fast service, critical for any enterprise environment.#R##N##R##N#Kerberos has been the authentication mechanism used for Microsoft Windows since Windows 2000. Every Windows Active Directory is also a fully functioning Kerberos KDC. Every major UNIX/Linux provider supports Kerberos, often based on the MIT reference code. There is no doubt that Kerberos is an enterprise level authentication solution. Kerberos is governed by several standards, including RFC-1510 describing the protocol, and RFC-1964 describing the GSS-API (Generic Security Services API) implementation. The MIT Kerberos Consortium is a guiding body consisting of a mix of academia and large corporations that guide the current development of Kerberos. With on-going code updates, conferences and RFC updates, Kerberos is a modern and effective authentication solution.#R##N##R##N#DB2 is an enterprise relational database management system. As a client-server product, DB2 is """"kerberized"""", meaning that it supports Kerberos as an authentication mechanism. DB2 integrates with the implementation of Kerberos provided by the operating system. DB2 supports cross-platform, cross-realm authentication using Kerberos to provide highly secure single sign-on capability. Kerberos support in DB2 is implemented through client and server security plugins that are accessed through the GSS-API interface. This plugin infrastructure, along with a sample Kerberos plugin, has allowed users to customize the plugin to suite their own Kerberos infrastructure."""	authentication;kerberos	Greg Stager	2011			kerberized internet negotiation of keys;kerberos;computer science;operating system;spnego;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;generic security service algorithm for secret key transaction;world wide web;ticket granting ticket;computer security	Crypto	-48.351642213984086	64.48148844453353	196070

During the last decades, we have witnessed an explosive growth of computer-technology and the Internet. Due to the growing role of computers and Internet in important business and state-related activities, investments to computer security and the security industry have also been growing fast. In spite of that, we also see the growing trend of cyber crime and losses due to security incidents. We predict that these three growing trends will continue in the future the main reasons being that: (1) as more and more assets will be connected to the Internet, the number of potential targets and stimuli for attackers grow; (2) fundamental (and hard to change) design decisions made in early development stages of todays Internet- and computer technology guarantee persistent technical vulnerabilities in Internet-based systems due to which attackers will always be one step ahead of defenders; (3) growing role of Chief Security Officers (CSOs) in organisations, who do not necessarily have to understand the detailed purpose and functionality of the system but whose duty is still to make the ITC system of the organisation secure. These reasons guarantee the continuous growth of the security industry but also the continuous growth of losses through cyber crime.	systems engineering	Ahto Buldas;Märt Saarepera	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58460-7_31	human–computer interaction;simulation;computer security;the internet;computer science;spite;vulnerability;duty	SE	-50.83552295945714	60.58562598298991	196761

Users must rely on the security of the browser's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Although the closed-padlock icon in a browser window depicts a secure connection, it does not imply a totally risk-free secure connection. Whenever the padlock is snapped or a security-related message pops up, you should be alerted and scrutinize the security of that connection. During the handshake of a secure connection, the server sends a public-key certificate to identify itself. You assume you have a secure connection to the entity identified in the certificate, but that entity may not be who you think it is. So, what is the critical issue in verifying a server certificate? It is in the root certification authority's (CA's) self-signed certificate that the verification starts. We trust root CAs (assuming they don't issue certificates to copycat servers) because our browser developer trusts them. An initial list of root CA certificates comes with browsers. Depending on their trust in browser developers, users may assume all root CAs that come with browsers are robust. However, authenticity is an important concern for other root CA certificates installed after the browser. An attacker can introduce bogus certificates for installation automated via a Visual Basic script. The client sees only a final approval screen that may easily be ignored by clicking on the """" yes """" button. Consider the following possible scenario. Suppose you've connected to your bank, www.xyzbank.com. Using network-spoofing techniques, an attacker reroutes this traffic to a counterfeit site and imitates a well-known root CA as the issuer for a fake certificate created for xyzbank. The attacker creates a second imitation certificate: a self-signed root CA certificate for the same well-known root CA. When these imitation certificates are used for a secure connection, you, as a client, will see a warning saying the root CA is not to be trusted. Taking a closer look at the certificate details is of no help, even harmful, because your favorite root CA seems to be the issuer. You might easily prefer to continue and maybe install the imitation certificate assuming there is a bug in your system. Because the well-known root CA's name appears on the final approval screen, it is easy to be fooled by this scheme.

However, security issues do exist within current products and proposed systems. One of these issues is the occurrence of implementation-specific information leakage, otherwise known as side-channel leakage. These have serious implications for voter secrecy. An attack based on electromagnetic leakage from Nedap voting machines has demonstrated that this type of leakage is a relevant issue within eVoting. Therefore, in this paper we present an analysis showing how common components of eVoting machines may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks. As side-channel leakage is also not sufficiently addressed in the many available requirement documents for eVoting systems, we also define requirements for side-channels within the scope of eVoting machine security. Our proposal involves the application of the Common Criteria method. These requirements can be integrated into existing or future Protection Profiles and Security Targets for eVoting systems.	acoustic cryptanalysis;attack tree;common criteria;cryptography;forward secrecy;functional programming;image scanner;information leakage;input/output;physical security;plaintext;protection profile;requirement;server (computing);side-channel attack;spectral leakage;vulnerability (computing)	Richard Frankland;Denise Demirel;Jurlind Budurushi;Melanie Volkamer	2011	2011 International Workshop on Requirements Engineering for Electronic Voting Systems	10.1109/REVOTE.2011.6045914	engineering;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-49.02151305538266	62.48046479601937	197066

Because the resources available on tags are very small, it is generally assumed that only symmetric-key cryptography can be used in such systems. Unfortunately, symmetric-key cryptography imposes negative trust issues between the various stake-holders, and risks compromising the security of the whole system if even a single tag is reverse engineered. This work presents a working prototype implementation of a secure RFID system which uses public-key cryptography to simplify deployment, reduce trust issues between the supply-chain owner and tag manufacturer, and protect user privacy. The authors' prototype system consists of a UHF tag running custom firmware, a standard off-the-shelf reader and custom point-of-sale terminal software.

Solving these challenges in security with new requirement of Ubicomp, could provide a potential future for such systems towards better mobility and higher confidence level of end-user services. We investigate the possibility to detect network intrusions, based on security nodes abilities. Specifically, we show how authentication can help build user profiles in each network node.

2fa5caa37454e9ed1dae5e11e64e3526ad5b73bc	where's the beep? security, privacy, and user misunderstandings of rfid		While extant for decades in the industrial sector, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is increasingly being incorporated into everyday products and objects. This growing ubiquity brings with it security and privacy concerns for end users due to implementations that fail to adequately protect personal or identifiable data stored on RF transponders, as well as RFID’s inherently stealthy broadcasting capabilities. Accordingly, taking effective measures to mitigate the risk of undesirable data transmission requires understanding what RFID is and how RF transmissions work. In our exploratory research, we attempt to elicit user mental models of RFID technology by interviewing users of three existing implementations of consumer-focused RFID technology: RF-enabled credit cards, transit passes, and the U.S. e-Passport. We explore user comprehension of RFID technology generally and these implementations specifically to gain an understanding of how end users conceptualize RFID and its risks. We found in this initial inquiry that our subjects generally lacked a mental model of how RFID functions, and in turn did not understand risks posed by RFID implementations or how to mitigate them. * This work was funded by TRUST (Team for Research In Ubiquitous Secure Technology), which receives support from the National Science Foundation (NSF award CCF-0424422). The authors wish to thank Shawna Hein, Jon Hicks, Travis Pinnick, and Aylin Selcukoglu for their assistance with interviews, and Deirdre Mulligan, Chris Hoofnagle, and Nathan Good for their valuable feedback. 1. Background RFID is a promiscuous technology: in its most basic implementation, an RF tag will transmit its stored data to any reader operating at its corresponding frequency. It is also a ubiquitous technology, imbuing everyday objects with “always on” computational and communication capabilities, though it is not yet ubiquitously deployed in the U.S. While the applications for “basic” tags are typically object tracking, such as inventory control, the possible linkage between a static identifier and an individual person raises privacy concerns, such as the tracking of individuals though public space. Contactless smart cards, a passive RF technology operating at 13.56Mhz with a general read range of around four to six inches, have far more computational power and storage capacity than simple RFID tags, including encryption capability. Contactless smart cards are generally (but not always) used in RF applications that require reader authentication and the secure storage of data. The applications we explore in this paper – credit cards, transit passes, and e-Passports – incorporate contactless smart card chips, though not all use smart cards’ authentication and cryptographic abilities. Due to the diversity of possible RFID deployments, assessing RFID’s security and privacy risks requires a case-by-case analysis, dependent on the type of RFID used, the information stored on the chip, and the context in which the implementation is deployed. In this work, we focus on applications of RFID that store an end user’s financial or personally identifiable information. We are interested in these implementations because unlike an RF tag attached to or embedded in a consumer product, ensuring the integrity of the data stored on an identity document or credit card is typically of concern to its owner since a breach of this data can have negative personal consequences, such as financial fraud or identity theft. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the object will be used in a public space, increasing the opportunity that the RF chip could be read (or “skimmed”) by an unauthorized party since, unlike traditional credit cards or passports, these objects can be read without the knowledge or consent of the user. Finally, because these are objects that the subjects already possess and use, establishing the context for our research presumably makes more sense to our subjects than investigating abstract concepts, particularly when talking to subjects with little or no knowledge about RFID. It is possible to create secure implementations of RF technology using contactless smart card chips, though at this stage in RFID development not all companies or agencies choose to do so. While there have been efforts to address security and privacy issues at the chip design level [Floerkemeier, Hachman], these efforts have yet to gain momentum, and thus users often bear some or all of the burden of mitigating privacy and security threats. For example, Heydt-Benjamin et al. [HeydtBenjamin] discovered in 2006 that credit card issuers were not encrypting data stored on RF-enabled credit cards. The original proposal for the U.S. e-Passport had no security features in place to protect the passport holder’s personal data. While the Department of State, in response to public criticism, incorporated both a Faraday cage and weak encryption (Basic Access Control) into the final e-Passport design, as of 2008 it appears credit card issuers continue to store credit card information in the clear. One can speculate that this choice is based in part upon the fact that despite adhering to the ISO 14443 standard, the data can only be accessed by readers using compatible software. This “security through obscurity” approach is only viable as long as compliant readers or software are not obtained or hacked by malicious parties  a likely risk, in part, because payment systems are widely deployed by retailers of varying trustworthiness. In contrast to credit cards, the transit agency pass we examined, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) EZRider pass, encrypts the data stored on their passes. As BART is a self-contained agency, managing their own readers and encryption keys is relatively possible; it is the complexity brought on by interoperability and key management that was stated as one of the most common reasons why the new U.S. passports were not using public key encryption [Kuchinskas]. In public implementations requiring large-scale interoperability, such as the new Department of Homeland Security PASS card and state issued enhanced driver’s licenses, no anti-skimming protections will be deployed. Instead, the only data stored on the chip will be a static identifier linked to the cardholder’s record in DHS databases, a design DHS considers to be protective of card holder privacy [DOS]. For those concerned with the thirty-foot read range of the UHF tags used in these cards, DHS will provide a Faraday shield for use with the card, 1 This underscores a confounding issue in the RFID field today – while chips may conform to an ISO standard, the operating system software on the chip itself is proprietary, and thus chips and readers produced by different manufacturers may not interoperate. Purchasing an ISO 14443 compliant RFID reader in no way guarantees that you will be able to read a 14443 compliant chip. 2 Heydt-Benjamin et al. were able to purchase a compatible credit card reader on eBay. placing the burden of preventing uninitiated reads on the individual cardholder. In our work, we aim to examine assumptions regarding end user comprehension and risk. For instance, what are end users’ mental models of how RFID systems work, and how do they compare to the actual functioning of these systems? Do they understand that tags and chips can often be read without their knowledge, and the steps they would need to take to mitigate skimming risks? How do their mental models affect their ability to make risk assessments about potential security or privacy threats? These questions present different challenges with ubiquitous technologies than with software, primarily because unlike software, where the tool for communicating with the user is the visual interface, RFID effectively has no user interface; both legitimate and illegitimate transactions can occur with no signaling of any kind to the user. To confound matters, with the applications we examine, the RF component has been laid atop a pre-existing form factor where a physical action on the part of the end user was previously required to share the information stored on the object. With the addition of RFID, the same actions can be accomplished without physical contact, or indeed conceivably without any action on the part of the user at all. These changes force users to reconceptualize how these objects “work,” violating established norms of information flow, an example of what Nissenbaum calls “contextual integrity” [Nissenbaum]. Because users can unwittingly transmit information without having taken direct action on their part, having a basic understanding of how RFID works (or being notified about this potential risk) is necessary in deciding whether or not to modify this risk to their privacy. As our initial examination discovered, users rely upon understandings of RFID that are often incorrect or based upon similar but not directly comparable technologies, and thus do not understand both the risks and how to mitigate those risks. 2. Related Work To date, there is little published work investigating RFID and usable security. As ubiquitous technologies are still in their infancy, most extant work in usable security focuses on user interface and interaction design for software systems, although several researchers have developed frameworks to account for security and pri3 Sophisticated malware today can find its way on to a user’s computer without the user realizing they took some precipitating action, but the user still generally had to take some action, such as clicking a link, to initialize the download. vacy issues in ubiquitous systems. Bellotti [Bellotti] introduced privacy principles for ubiquitous systems in 1993, focusing on the feedback given to the user and the user’s control over the capture of data, what is done with the data once in the system, the user’s ability to access and correct that data, and the purpose for ubiquitous data collection	access control;authentication;authorization;beep;biometric passport;card reader;computation;computer security;contactless payment;contactless smart card;dos;database;download;embedded system;encryption;faraday cage;high availability;human–computer interaction (security);ibm notes;identifier;interaction design;interoperability;inventory control;key management;linkage (software);malware;mental model;operating system;personally identifiable information;plaintext;privacy;public-key cryptography;purchasing;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;risk assessment;security through obscurity;software system;transponder;travis ci;trust (emotion);ultra high frequency;united states passport card;user interface	Jennifer King;Andrew McDiarmid	2008				Security	-50.46273299834696	64.88431647892656	198828

The interactions between economic and security properties and the exchangeu0027s essentially non-monotonic security behavior; a valid traderu0027s valid action can invalidate other tradersu0027 previously valid positions, are a challenge for security research. We show the security properties that guarantee an Exchangeu0027s economic viability (availability of trading information, liquidity, confidentiality of positions, absence of price discrimination, risk-management) and an attack when tradersu0027 anonymity is broken. We describe all key operations for a secure, fully distributed Futures-Exchange, hereafter referred to as simply the Exchange. Our distributed, asynchronous protocol simulates the centralized functionality under the assumptions of anonymity of the physical layer and availability of a distributed ledger. We consider security with abort (in absence of honest majority) and extend it to penalties. Our proof of concept implementation and its optimization (based on zk-SNARKs and SPDZ) demonstrate that the computation of actual trading days (along Thomson-Reuters Tick History DB) is feasible for low-frequency markets; however, more research is needed for high-frequency ones.	centralized computing;computation;confidentiality;futures and promises;futures studies;interaction;mathematical optimization;risk management;traders;traffic exchange	Fabio Massacci;Chan Nam Ngo;Jing Nie;Daniele Venturi;Julian Williams	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)	10.1109/SP.2018.00028	anonymity;computer security;proof of concept;computer science;futures contract;ranging;price discrimination;currency;commerce;secure multi-party computation;market liquidity	Security	-54.14420007729893	66.06384869982868	198983
8df6b0bd9dc4e60690a993cd75573d6788dc7356	a multidimensional analysis of malicious and compromised websites. (plusieurs axes d'analyse de sites web compromis et malicieux)		The World Wide Web has become necessary to the lives of hundreds of millions of people, has allowed society to create new jobs, new marketplaces, new leisure activities as well as new ways of sharing information and money. Unfortunately, however, the web is also attracting more and more criminals who see it as a new means of making money and abusing people’s property and services for their own benefit. The World Wide Web is today a very complex ecosystem: for this reason, also attacks that take place on the Internet can be very complex in nature, and different from each other. In general, however, web attacks involve four main actors, namely the attackers, the vulnerable websites hosted on the premises of hosting providers, the web users who end up being victims of attacks, and the security companies and researchers who are involved in monitoring the Internet and in trying to spot and fight malicious or compromised websites. In this dissertation, we perform a multidimensional analysis of attacks involving malicious or compromised websites. In particular, the focus of our work is to observe the phenomenon of compromised and malicious websites from the point of view of the four actors that are involved in web attacks: attackers, hosting providers, web users and security companies. Although the study of malicious code on the web is a rather common subject in contemporary computer security literature, our approach based on observing the phenomenon from the points of view of its multiple actors is totally novel, and had never been adopted before. In particular, we first analyze web attacks from a hosting provider’s point of view, showing that current state-of-the-art security measures should allow most providers to detect simple signs of compromise on their customers’ websites. However, as we will show in this dissertation, most hosting providers appear to fail in applying even these basic security practices. Second, we switch our point of view on the attackers, by studying their modus operandi and their goals in a large distributed experiment involving the collection of attacks performed against hundreds of vulnerable web sites. Third, we observe the behavior of victims of web attacks, based on the analysis of web browsing habits of the customers of a big security company. This allows us to understand if it would be feasible to build risk profiles for web users, somehow similarly to what car insurance companies do for their customers.	computer security;ecosystem;internet;malware;money;multidimensional analysis;web 2.0;world wide web	Davide Canali	2014				Security	-55.47930422157688	63.252083152587815	199196

As a result, the extract the crucial digital evidence in the smart phone, it has now become a challenge in the technology time. In particular, it is for when the smart phone applications are committed as the illegal contacts. In this paper, we discuss the most five popular mobile social networking applications in iPhone usages. The backup files of social networking applications could offer us the crucial evidence in this paper study. The relative information of social networking applications operated in iPhone is able to be accessed if necessary, even though iPhone has been destructed or encrypted by the suspect. It could help the investigators to exactly reconstruct the crime venue and find the truth.	backup;encryption;information exchange;internet access;mobile app;real-time data;real-time locating system;smartphone;venue (sound system)	Yu-Cheng Tso;Shiuh-Jeng Wang;Cheng-Ta Huang;Wei-Jen Wang	2012		10.1145/2184751.2184827	embedded system;dumb pipe;information exchange;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network;social network	Security	-50.02664758859545	63.61225302459603	199372

We focus our study on Skype, although other real-time communication applications may have similar privacy issues. We first design a scheme that calls an identified-targeted user inconspicuously to find his IP address, which can be done even if he is behind a NAT. By calling the user periodically, we can then observe the mobility of the user. We show how to scale the scheme to observe the mobility patterns of tens of thousands of users. We also consider the linkability threat, in which the identified user is linked to his Internet usage. We illustrate this threat by combining Skype and BitTorrent to show that it is possible to determine the filesharing usage of identified users. We devise a scheme based on the identification field of the IP datagrams to verify with high accuracy whether the identified user is participating in specific torrents. We conclude that any Internet user can leverage Skype, and potentially other real-time communication systems, to observe the mobility and filesharing usage of tens of millions of identified users.	bittorrent;datagram;file sharing;internet;network address translation;peer-to-peer;privacy;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription	Stevens Le Blond;Chao Zhang;Arnaud Legout;Keith W.

Recently, it has even been adopted in many real world scenarios. In this paper, we study keystroke dynamics, the most researched of such behavioral biometrics, from the perspective of an adversary. We designed two adversarial agents with a standard accuracy convenience tradeoff: Targeted K-means++, which is an expensive, but extremely effective adversarial agent, and Indiscriminate K-means++, which is slightly less powerful, but adds no overhead cost to the attacker. With Targeted K-means++ we could compromise the security of 40-70% of users within ten tries. In contrast, with Indiscriminate K-means++, the security of 30-50% of users was compromised. Therefore, we conclude that while keystroke dynamics has potential, it is not ready for security critical applications yet. Future keystroke dynamics research should use such adversaries to benchmark the performance of the detection algorithms, and design better algorithms to foil these. Finally, we show that the K-means++ adversarial agent generalizes well to even other types of behavioral biometrics data by applying it on a dataset of touchscreen swipes.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;authentication;benchmark (computing);biometrics;event (computing);k-means++;keystroke dynamics;overhead (computing);touchscreen	Parimarjan Negi;Prafull Sharma;Vivek Jain;Bahman Bahmani	2018			computer science;internet privacy;computer security;biometrics;k-means clustering	Security	-52.92457653441974	65.37803715338416	199798
