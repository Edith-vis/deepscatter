bf4d6afd8ea92508cb3a60e42226622fa4e50a6e	new light on old stone: recording and reinventing visual culture	photography;digital imaging;medieval;bible;wales;visual culture	In this paper the author reflects on his experience of photographing artworks in churches, mainly as part of his role as photographer on the Imaging the Bible in Wales Project (2005–8). The ability to subjectively create new photographic images from original objects is considered and different approaches to photographic recording are evaluated for a variety of effects. An additional perspective on the creation of new images by photographic means is given by the way that medieval visual culture was retained and reused as churches were restored in the second half of the 19th century. This applies not only to ‘old stone’ but also stained glass, woodcarving and wall painting from the medieval period, which was sometimes crafted into new composite works. In conclusion the author briefly considers the potential for artists to make their own visual interpretations of historical visual culture.

Typically, it is often more challenging to shoot bottle rockets for distance instead of shooting them straight up and measuring altitude, as is often done. Using a device made from pipe and wood to launch bottle rockets and control the launch angle creates a m+uch0 more interesting problem for students who are attempting to optimize launch conditions. Plans are presented for a launcher that allow students to adjust the launch angle. To help embellish the exercise, we supplement the bottle rocket with a model using virtual reality and a photorealistic simulation of the launch that allows the students to appreciate the optimization problems associated with water and air pressure and launch angle. Our usage data indicates that students easily adapt to the virtual reality simulation and use our simulation for intuitive experiments on their own to optimize launch conditions.	experiment;launch angle;mathematical optimization;simulated reality;simulation;usage data;virtual reality	Charles Nippert	2012	iJEP		simulation;engineering;operations management;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-54.732364149795124	-28.899920986353365	157228

The approach of computer music has proven to be successful within several groups of students at La Universidad de Los Andes in Bogota, between 1992 and 1997. Given that music education at an early age, and at high school levels is neither mandatory nor offered in many schools, makes it difficult to develop a high standard of musical culture in the country. Our belief is that this missing gap can be filled by learning about music from and electroacoustic point of view, and by using computer music techniques. BACKGROUND Electroacoustic music in Colombia has been active since the 1960s, and has been used by major composers ever since. The mixed and live electronics performance side has been limited somehow. Computer music has been on the minds of some engineers, and composers since the 1970s, and materialized during the late 1980s. At that time, compositions, and performances using computer technology, spread individually, and at some universities mainly in Bogota (Universidad de Los Andes and National University of Colombia), and in Manizales (Universidad Autonoma de Manizales). Manizales had the first computer music studio in the country. From there on, music departments at these universities offered courses in the history of electroacoustic music, algorithmic composition, live electronics, synthesis, and filtering. MUSIC EDUCATION IN COLOMBIA Music education in the country has primarily concentrated on two major aspects. First by teaching western history of music and technical skills for performance. Second by studying folklore. There has been a great effort to develop high musical standards, and traditional instrument skills by importing or mimicking methods from European countries, and the U.S. Folklore is studied from the compositional, and anthropological sides mainly. STATE OF THE ART The new college generations have been exposed to commercial, and technological developments around the globe. As a result, they have found some sort of identity, by shortening gaps with people in other countries. Therefore there is a better absorption rate between cultures, and arts from around the world. Among local artists there is an increasing interest in competing with colleagues in other countries, implying that, there is a need to communicate their art with high level standards. By teaching music from an electroacoustic point of view, some preconceptions about the nature of music have been turned down. We have assumed that the essentials of music are the elements of sound and, performance. For most students, computer tools are at their reach, and feel secure by using them. Thus, we believe, computer music can help Colombians to be able to compete at a worldwide level. Next are the results of using existing electroacoustic and computer music techniques. FACTORS AND VARIABLES The following factors were taken into account while developing music education with computers: The value of music, and other arts among Colombian society. The meaning of music for individuals ranging from a low level of education to those in managerial positions. The quality of aesthetic experiences of people interested in music. The relative influence on human behavior by different styles of music. The role of music instruction on such educational tasks as, organization, rhythm, and pace keeping. The concept that music fulfills different needs, and roles in human life. Roles I like, emotional expression, aesthetic enjoyment, entertainment, and maintenance of the cohesiveness. Music as a human behavior. The mental construct of differing levels within society, and its effect on what people do. The fact that this differences affect music preferences, and the use of music. The idea that music is something that people learn, just as they learn many other things in their lives. MUSIC EDUCATION WITH MIDI As part of the technological revolution abroad, MIDI has reached the hands of many music students. To avoid a lack of understanding of the relationship between music, its sciences, and technologies, a course describing the basics of computers and musical instruments was developed and taught at Los Andes since 1993. The goal was to induce most students to this methods. Subjects included: computer history, computer basics, algorithms and logic, the role of musical instrument, the synthesizer as an instrument, the MIDI protocol, and introduction to interactive systems like MAX. Students learned about operating, composing, performing with MIDI, and also about the computer keyboard interface. Most of them acknowledged an instant gratification for listening to their own works at time of composition. MUSIC EDUCATION AND THE AESTHETICS OF ELECTROACOUSTIC MUSIC Perhaps this course has influenced the most. It was developed as part of the sequence of music histories, but rapidly changed to be part of composition, and music technology. It was first offered in 1993 , and was opened not only to music students, but to the university public as well (no prerequisites). Students from areas such as, engineering, psychology, the humanities, and fine arts have taken the course ever since. They have learned about definitions such as electroacoustic music, concrete music, electronic music, electric and electronic instruments, live electronics and computer music. Recordings of the great composers have also been analyzed. The most important discovery is the sound set approach, instead of the tonal or the chromatic approach. MUSIC EDUCATION TRANSCENDS TO FINE ARTS Through the electroacoustics course more and more students from fine arts became interested in sound as another of their plastic elements. Therefore a course involving sound was developed and introduced for the first time in January of 1995 at the fine arts department at Los Andes. The goal here was to suggest artists to work with sound as matter, and to produce a soundscape portrait. The problem, as with other technologies like animation, and video was the notion of time. Most students challenged it. The gorgeous atmosphere, not found among music departments, allowed to talk about concepts like acousmatics, sound projections, art-music, and sound installations. The role of sound in radio, video, animations, and performances were also discussed. For most artists computer music software packages like Sound-Edit, and Pro-Tools were very intuitive. The same with filtering programs like GRM-TOOLS, and HYPERPRISM. COMPUTER MUSIC TECHNOLOGIES AND MUSIC EDUCATION As a result of previously described courses some students have gone beyond the basics of music theory, performance, the science of music, and have embarked on projects including various fields of computer music. The quality of an interdisciplinary school has helped to establish relations with the College of Engineering, and the Fine Arts Department. They have given some conditions, to carry on with computer music objectives . Following are the results of working on this various fields. RESULTS IN ALGORITHMIC COMPOSITION Students have learned to compose with machines and used tools from mathematical logic and physics. They have managed to compose for electronic instruments in no traditional ways. A sense for new interactive compositions has also been developed. In addition students analyze, and describe various styles of compositions, algorithmically. In practice, this method has resulted to be more operative than traditional composition. For computer science students, this has come as a turning point as to how to design better interfaces that musicians can use more effectively. RESULTS IN COGNITION AND PSYCHOACOUSTICS For the first time attention is given to the way people perceives music in the country. From the standpoint of cognitive sciences, a new meaning to musical expression has been explored. There is also a change to the way musical masterpieces are analyzed by means of perceptive processes instead of just plain musical theory. There are some attempts to find some relationship between musical structures, and artificial intelligence. RESULTS USING ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS METHODS Students can now create or design their own musical instruments. This approach gives them a different taste to the meaning of composition and expression . One advantage is that these techniques discover the nature of the physics of sound, and imply the relationship of music with science. From the analysis standpoint more attention is paid to timbre and spectrums of sounds. There is also a marginal approach to the Fourier transform. For engineers , this has come as to the idea, on how to expand the bandwidth of a sound, by quantizing, synthesizing, and processing it, in a practical way. RESULTS BY WORKING WITH PHYSICAL MODELING Physical Modeling has given the advantage of studying the musical instrument from the interface, and sound generation perspective. This implies an understanding of the behavior of the instrument, and its acoustics; very useful in traditional orchestration. Students can now think in terms of virtual instruments. For electrical engineers, physical models presented the challenge of researching in other filter designs, and new mathematical formulas for manipulating sounds, in artistic, and meaningful ways. INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS By learning about interactive systems students applied their knowledge to news ways of performance, new interfaces, and unconventional concerts, including machine performance, and performing with a machine. Artists learned to produce sound sculptures.

The procedures evolved from early 20th century artists who pioneered the fine art of painting and sculpting “unseen form” known as “abstract art.” With the advent of computers, this adventure led to composing instructions (software) for generating worlds of form that are accessible only with extensive computing. By joining software form generators with fine arts practice, I create aesthetic objects to be contemplated much as we contemplate the wondrous forms of nature. The software, written with Basic and Digital Microprocessor/Plotting Language (DM/PLTM), automatically generates work that follows the artist’s instructions. A fine art form generator specifies the procedures for initiating, developing, and improvising an artist’s art-making idea. Such a form generator may be likened to a biological genotype, since it contains the coded information for generating the form. The procedure for executing the code, somewhat analogous to biological epigenesis, grows the art form. The creation and control of these instructions provide an awesome means for an artist to visualize form-growing concepts. Such routines provide access to an infinity of visual worlds never before seen by the human eye. It is noteworthy that such procedures hold much in common with processes associated with crystallization and genetics.	awesome;basic;computer;gene regulatory network;microprocessor	Roman Verostko	1997		10.1145/259081.259160	computer graphics (images);computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science	PL	-55.4145922669114	-26.00551978539741	157773

This paper argues that understanding such information graphics is a discourse-level problem. In particular, it requires assimilating information from multiple knowledge sources to recognize the intended message of the graphic, just as recognizing intention in text does. Moreover, when an article is composed of text and graphics, the intended message of the information graphic (its discourse intention) must be integrated into the discourse structure of the surrounding text and contributes to the overall discourse intention of the article. This paper describes how we extend plan-based techniques that have been used for understanding traditional discourse to the understanding of information graphics. This work is part of a project to develop an interactive natural language system that provides sight-impaired users with access to information graphics.	crystal oscillator;data assimilation;freedom of information laws by country;graphics;infographic;information technology security audit;natural language;trust (emotion)	Sandra Carberry;Stephanie Elzer Schwartz;Nancy Green;Kathleen F.

By taking advantage available 3D hardware and software technologies, it is possible to introduce stereo imaging as a novel visual art form and to a wider audience. While refashioning earlier media of painting, perspective and experimental digital animation, artists are closely exploring the relationships between the overlapping worlds of visual art, architecture, and new technologies. At the same time, the viewer is becoming essential in the construction of the image contributing to a new set of aesthetic and cultural principles. The Undiscovered Country will focus on 3D stereo art content development.	computer animation;definition;image;web content development	Ina Conradi;Yew Yong Xiang Ivan	2011	2011 International Conference on Cyberworlds	10.1109/CW.2011.24	computer vision;digital art;painting;computer animation;multimedia;cinematography;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-51.44255377610924	-29.113788424451155	164774

In sharp contrast to collections of physical possessions in the home, in the digital realm there are few possessions that are considered special. As a result, digital possessions are infrequently used, e.g. for reminiscing or storytelling. By studying cherished physical and digital possessions and designing novel products or systems, this PhD explores how digital media can become more cherished. More specifically, newly created designs will aim to integrate physical and digital realms and encourage novel creation or augmentation of digital media, here called digital craft, as a promising means to increase attachment to digital possessions.	attachments;digital media;realms	Connie Golsteijn	2012		10.1145/2212776.2212866	design research;human–computer interaction;computer science;digital media;interaction design;multimedia	HCI	-52.79476442376986	-30.65977270308347	166022

It arrives at a place with some goods, and then it leaves to a different place with different goods. A container itself is a kind of transportation in the viewpoint from goods. We imagined if the goods were we, a container would be a train. We have proposed a new experience-based artwork using a container to resemble to a train, named Train Window of Container. In this paper, we discuss the system implemented in a container that provides us to feel a sense as if we were in a train. When you enter the container, you can see various kinds of scenes through train windows and can also hear a sound of train movement. You can see scenes of Japan, Korea, France, and so on. Inside of the container is dark which provides you a new sense of moving with visual and auditory information. For the implementation of the artwork, we used 10 displays as windows of train and 10 speakers for the sound, and showed video of landscapes. We exhibited the artwork for five days and had about 13,000 audiences.	microsoft windows	Kunihiro Nishimura;Yasuhiro Suzuki;Munehiko Sato;Oribe Hayashi;LiWei Yang;Kentaro Kimura;Shinya Nishizaka;Yusuke Onojima;Yuki Ban;Yuma Muroya;Shigeo Yoshida;Michitaka Hirose	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34292-9_22	simulation;engineering;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-54.22507026717194	-27.40760838573067	166767

These games usually highlight some form of personal gain, diminishing potential for positive interactivity. Phantasm is a game where players' skills are measured by how well they can communicate together. Players take on the roles of either special agent or master hacker. The goal is to get the agent to an exit. However, there are many enemies and obstacles that only the hacker can see, through various security cameras and filters. The agent, however, can hear sounds emitting from the walls and other objects. Both players must keep a constant flow of communication in aiding the agent of what routes to take, what and how to interact with the environments, and where, precisely, to shoot at invisible threats. This game will help bring players closer, as they will need to understand each others way of thinking in a tense and suspenseful gaming environment.	closed-circuit television;interactivity;phantasmagoria;threat (computer)	James Bonnyman;James E.

This paper explores whether we could embed our behavior modeling framework (described in the companion paper, Part 1) behind a legacy first person shooter 3D game environment to recreate portions of the Black Hawk Down scenario. Section 1 amplifies the interoperability needs and challenges confronting the field, presents the questions that are examined, and describes the test scenario. Sections 2 and 3 review the software and knowledge engineering methodology, respectively, needed to create the system and populate it with bots. Results (Section 4) and discussion (Section 5) reveal that we were able to generate plausible and adaptive recreations of Somalian crowds, militia, women acting as shields, suicide bombers, and more. Also, there are specific lessons learned about ways to advance the field so that such interoperabilities will become more affordable and widespread.	behavior model;behavioral modeling;first person shooter;first-person (video games);game engine;human reliability;interoperability;knowledge engineering;performance prediction;population;scenario testing;simulation;technological singularity	Barry G.

The FX Palo Alto Laboratory combined notetaking software and behind-the-scenes network hardware to create an unobtrusive multimedia conference room capable of capturing a range of presentation styles. U sing high-quality multimedia recording to capture meetings, presentations, and lectures requires a substantial infrastructure. Since meetings often take place inside a room (or rooms virtually connected as in a teleconference), it makes sense to tightly integrate the system into a conference room. Exploiting digital audio and video technology 1-9 to make the room itself a computing environment supports the recording of its activities and provides content for documentation, communication, and collaboration. Meetings span a range of informational and group activities. Examples include staff meetings, design discussions, project reviews, videoconferences, presentations, and classes. Usually handwritten notes, augmented with presentation material that’s either hand copied or obtained from the speaker form the basis of meeting records. Some cases require more detail, so the meeting is recorded on audio or video. Those who attended the meeting along with those who missed it use these records for review, retrieving facts and details. Sometimes their activities are more involved. They study the records, prepare reports, and create meeting summaries. This article focuses on applying multimedia to meeting capture and note taking with digital video and ink in a physical conference room. Just as pen and paper notes augments an individual’s memory, a multimedia conference room that assists in producing meeting records augments the group memory of collaborative work. There are other opportunities for using technology and media in meeting rooms, including software to facilitate meeting processes, and in this broader area of computer supported meeting rooms a substantial body of research exists—for example, see Nunamaker et al.10 and Stefik et al.11	comparison of notetaking software;digital video;documentation;meeting maker;networking hardware;palo;word lists by frequency	Patrick Chiu;Ashutosh Kapuskar;Sarah Reitmeier;Lynn Wilcox	2000	IEEE MultiMedia	10.1109/93.895154	local area network;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;multimedia;law;world wide web;collaborative software;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-48.354780253457385	-26.175254176806096	170338

The sheer number of items in a software product that can be subject to translation is overwhelming. The issue is further compounded as the number of required target languages increases.  This situation aptly describes the IBM® technical documentation translation challenge. With each passing year, the number of documentation pages grows. It is safe to assume that the number of graphics used to improve user comprehension also increases proportionately along with the amount of new textual information.  A system and process to automate translation is a necessity to curb the escalating cost of providing national language versions of graphics. IBM has such a system and process; however, they have been in place since the years of hardcopy manuals with some minor adjustments added when the World Wide Web tide swept the globe in the 1990s.  Many years have passed and the method of producing technical documentation has changed with the introduction of XML and new graphics file formats. The time has come to revisit the current process of creating graphics, inserting them in an XML authoring environment, and then translating the whole package.

5188c37f41ae94e72da823b34d2951495aa0d46a	an intellectual journey in history: preserving indian cultural heritage		Heritage preservation requires preserving the tangibles (monuments, sculpture, coinage, etc) and the intangibles (history, traditions, stories, dance, etc). Besides these artefacts, there is a huge amount of background knowledge that correlates all these resources and establishes their context. In this work, we present a new paradigm for heritage preservation  'an Intellectual Journey into the past', which is more advanced than physical explorations of heritage sites and virtual explorations of monuments and museums. This paradigm proposes an experiential expedition into a historical era by using an ontology to inter-link the digital heritage artefacts with their background knowledge. A multimedia ontology encoded in the Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) is used to illustrate this paradigm by correlating the digital artefacts with their history as well their living context in today's world. The user experience of this paradigm involves a virtual traversal of a heritage site, with an ontology guided navigation through space and time and a dynamic display of different kinds of media.

The work describes the characters and events surrounding the mysterious deaths of Gilbert Bogle and Margaret Chandler in Sydney on New Year’s Day 1963. Users can retrieve and play 104 movie clips (photographic images, animations, text and sound) from the project’s digital library. The GUI is both an image illustrating connections between movie clips and an instrument for controlling them. Remembering Bogle Chandler tells an old story in a new way. In order to explore the novel qualities of the work, this article employs terminology and concepts from three essentialist theories of digital media that define the ways in which digital media differ from old or legacy media. To assess the impact of these properties on storytelling, the article also explores audience responses to the work.	chandler (software);cinema 4d;digital library;digital media;gilbert cell;graphical user interface;map;new media;observable;spatial file manager;spatial navigation;spatial variability;theory;video clip	Rebecca Young	2014	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626268.2013.776973	visual arts;transcoding;new media;human–computer interaction;epistemology;computer science;variable;artificial intelligence;digital media;operating system;multimedia;sociology;world wide web;modular design;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-53.095956699152055	-29.211697733975562	172709
ffa77a7b959351dd52cbf910faf54e6bf85283e2	tiffany holmes		INTRODUCTION Breakout, the first mass-marketable video game, was a defining game experience for many in the 1970s. It positioned Atari at the forefront of the game industry under the leadership of Apple Computer’s founders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The long-term potency of game culture has since been firmly established. In 2001, 25 years after the original version was released, MacSoft released a new Breakout that incorporated kidnapping narratives, paddle angling, and power-ups into the classic game. Also last year, the release of two powerful new consoles, Microsoft’s XBox and Nintendo’s Game Cube, redoubled the hype surrounding the obsession with gaming. In 2000, the video gaming industry surpassed Hollywood in gross annual revenues to become the second-largest entertainment industry after music in the United States.

VMs have inherited trust problems, e.g. sellers may advertise a perfect deal but doesn’t deliver the promised service or product at the end. In view of this, we propose a five-sense feedback oriented reputation mechanism (supported by 3D technology and VR) particularly for VMs. The user study confirms that users prefer VMs with our reputation mechanism over those with traditional ones. In our reputation mechanism, five-sense feedback is objective and buyers can use it directly in their reputation evaluation of target sellers. However, for the scenarios where buyers only provide subjective ratings, we apply the approach of subjectivity alignment for reputation computation (SARC), where ratings provided by one buyer can then be aligned (converted) for another buyer according to the two buyers’ subjectivity. Evaluation results indicate that SARC can more accurately model sellers’ reputation than the state-of-the-art approaches.	blade;baseline (configuration management);biological anthropology;computation;e-commerce;emoticon;experiment;openvms;prototype;reputation system;sampling (signal processing);simulation;social network;stratified sampling;trust (emotion);usability testing;virtual reality simulator;visualization (graphics);z/vm	Hui Fang;Jie Zhang;Murat Sensoy;Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann	2014	Electronic Commerce Research and Applications	10.1016/j.elerap.2014.08.002	marketing;advertising;world wide web;commerce;sense	Web+IR	-51.29588456793511	-30.96608389482671	175677

However, many types of collaborative work are much more parallel, with two or more people viewing, modifying and adding information simultaneously. Effectively supporting parallel collaborative work electronically is still a challenge because of the current serial work paradigm found in most software. One promising and, broadly applicable capability is a collaborative shared computer display (CSCD). A CSCD allows several people to simultaneously view, and possibly annotate or manipulate, a live computer display sent from a remote machine to their local computers. We have been building a prototype CSCD, the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) TeleViewer, which supports cross-platform display sharing between MacOS, Windows and UNIX operating systems. The current EMSL TeleViewer prototype supports display sharing of application windows, screen regions and desktops. We are adding enhancements to the EMSL TeleViewer that will provide collaborative annotations over the display, shared mouse cursors/pointer, high-performance data compression and session recording capabilities. When completed, the EMSL TeleViewer will provide researchers, their collaborators and the scientific community with a powerful tool that can by itself open up many new avenues for collaboration and will fit well with other tools to provide a comprehensive collaborative environment.	computer monitor	Paul E.

These are relatively cheap techniques that simulate diffuse indirect illumination in a way that looks realistic, though they are not global illumination techniques. The concept of obscurances first appeared in the late 1990s in the context of videogames and a few years later the idea was simplified and used in production rendering of movies under the name of ambient occlusion. In recent years many articles with ideas to improve or accelerate these techniques have appeared, while ambient occlusion has been included in commercial renderers and popularized in videogames and the movie industry. This survey reviews the birth and evolution of obscurances and ambient occlusion techniques in recent years.	ambient occlusion;computation;global illumination;illumination (image);precomputation;real-time clock;real-time locating system;simulation	Àlex Méndez-Feliu;Mateu Sbert	2008	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-008-0213-4	simulation;computer science;mathematics;ambient occlusion;global illumination;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-48.779920283726256	-29.21224678074544	176650

756171cbad41f547e0d90d8fbff42319f869c52c	the future of programming interactive experience	computer program	The Future of Programming Interactive Experience is a multimedia exhibit about future directions in the field of computer programming. Visitors to the exhibit will be able to explore visions resulting from a recent Future of Programming Workshop. They will also be able to contribute their own commentary on these visions, which will become part of the exhibit for subsequent visitors. INTRODUCTION We are not too shy to speculate on future automobiles or homes or even computer hardware. But what about that abstract stuff we call programs—the instructions running behind the scenes that computers and soon cars and houses cannot function without? Future scenario videos such as the Knowledge Navigator [1] and 1995 [4] portray advanced technology but gloss over issues of programming. Our goal in creating the Future of Programming Interactive Experience was to explore the potential of software design directly. Glinert [3] provides us with some tantalizing glimpses into future programming environments. The recent video, Global Desktop 2 [2] begins to speculate on programming, but leaves many questions unanswered. Will advances in computer technology result in new ways for specifying programs such as voice input or hand sketches? Will other aspects of the software development cycle, such as maintenance or documentation, see significant improvements? And how will the nature of the programming community change? Will it expand to include most everyone using computers or will the ranks narrow to include only the technological elite? THE FUTURE OF PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP To explore these questions we organized the Future of Programming Workshop held in June 1993 in Boulder, Colorado. The workshop brought together some fifty researchers from the United States and Great Britain to discuss their visions of the future. Participants came from variety of backgrounds including software Permlss!on to copy wtthout fee all or part of this material is granted prov,ded that the copses mm not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the ACM copyright notice and the title of the pubhcatlon and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permmsion of the Association for Computing Machinery.

The workshop was sponsored by the University of Colorado at Boulder and US West Advanced Technologies. For two days, workshop participants gathered in small groups to debate various topics related to the future software design. Each group was given the task of developing a visual scenario depicting their ideas for the future. Professional illustrators and video producers were assigned to each group to assist in the scenario development. By the end of the workshop, the groups had assembled a variety of presentations ranging from a ten minute video to a role-playing performance to a series of cartoon sketches. Each scenario was presented to all participants and discussed. Five scenarios were developed. One group focused on software tools to support software development, including applications of agent technology. Two groups used kids as their focal audience. One of these kid scenarios featured the role of networking in facilitating collaboration between kids and working scientists, supported by hypothetical flexible programming tools. The other showed an animated simulation model that could be reprogrammed by students as part of a science project. A fourth scenario explored a mixture of ubiquitous computing ideas, in which computing power is embedded in many places in the environment, and virtual reality as a way of portraying and manipulating the internals of software systems. The fiflh group, nicknamed “Doom and Gloom”, developed a, newscast of the future, in which emerging legal restrictions, growing out of concerns about software reliability and safety, lead to sweeping changes in the role and organization of programming. THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE This exhibit allows visitors to explore each of the five scenarios developed at tlhe workshop, together with commentary from the original participants and by us. Further, the presentation software will permit visitors to make their own contributions to the commentary. Visitors can register agreement or disagreement with the ideas presented at the workshop, can add arguments or elaborations, or outline additional scenarios.

The case study consists of the marble head from Leontinoi in southeastern Sicily, acquired in the 18th century and later kept in the collection of the Museum of Castello Ursino in Catania, and a marble torso, retrieved in 1904 and since then displayed in the Archaeological Museum of Siracusa. Due to similar stylistic features, the two pieces can be dated to the end of the sixth century BC. Their association has been an open problem, largely debated by scholars, who have based their hypotheses on comparisons between pictures, but the reassembly of the two artifacts was never attempted. As a result the importance of such an artifact, which could be the only intact Archaic statue of a kouros ever found in Greek Sicily, has not fully been grasped by the public. Consequently, the curatorial dissemination of the knowledge related with such artifacts is purely based on photographic material. As a response to this scenario, the two objects have been 3-D scanned and virtually reassembled. The result has been shared digitally with the public via a web platform and, in order to include increased accessibility for the public with physical or cognitive disabilities, copies of the reassembled statue have been 3-D printed and an interactive test with the 3-Dmodel has been carried out with a haptic device. © 2017 SPIE and IS&T [DOI: 10.1117/1.JEI.26.1.011025]	accessibility;haptic technology;printing;segmentation and reassembly;virtual reality;webplatform	Filippo Stanco;Davide Tanasi;Dario Allegra;Filippo Luigi Maria Milotta;Gioconda Lamagna;Giuseppina Monterosso	2017	J.

With a background in psychology and science, she’s been painting for more than 20 years. For most of her life, she’s also been involved in theater and dance. The teachers who infl uenced her the most, however, were those outside the constraints of formal education. “The most valuable education I received both in Europe, where I spent my younger years, and in the US has been from artists and teachers I admired and sought out as mentors outside the academic arena,” she recalls, “where the tutoring was one-on-one, reminiscent of the old apprenticeship mode.” As a result, Freer studied drawing, Chinese brush painting, watercolor, and collage—all with experienced tutors. Yet over time she eventually grew frustrated with the brush. It just wasn’t the right tool to project the ideas she wanted to communicate. “The digital medium allows me to create complex multilayered images that I am unable to achieve with a paintbrush,” she says. “I enjoy the spontaneity and interaction with the software as the image emerges from this collaboration. The computer programs serve up surprising, unique twists of the image, encouraging further experimentation.” Freer’s main complaint about the brush is that it’s just too slow. When it comes to the digital domain, she cites the legendary Japanese 3D illustrator, Hiroshi Yoshii: “At last I have a medium that works as fast as my imagination.”	computer program;emergence;paintbrush	Gary Singh	2010	IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications	10.1109/MCG.2010.36	computer vision;digital art;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics;digital image;3d computer graphics;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-54.68231668215983	-26.952891118481325	184533

59620beeb5677430770cde8ff2ef4e5efef28257	copyright protection for digital images on portable devices		The astonishing rapid diffusion of portable devices (i.e. smartphones, tablets, etc.) has had a big, and often positive, impact on our every-day life. These devices have new advanced features developed specifically because of user demand. For example, it is now possible to publish directly the pictures obtained by means of the internal camera of a smartphone on our social network accounts, or on an image hosting service. It is therefore important to have tools, on the portable devices, that can prove the ownership of the pictures and to use them before publishing images. Digital watermarking techniques are commonly used for the copyright protection of images and videos. We have developed a tool for portable devices based on the Android OS that allows the embedding of a digital visible or invisible watermark into a digital image.

61859bfef773a727482d77178485cec64219f71e	a videodisc training system for academic computing services	videodisc training system;academic computing service	One of the difficult problems presented to academic computing services is the training of a growing number of novice users. Some large installations have acquired or developed video tape instructional systems while others have spent sigtiicant amounts of staff time on training these users. Northwest Missouri State University(NWMSU) is developing a videodisc system to introduce students to its timesharing services and library automation services. The videodisc system is controlled by an IBM PC compatible Zenith 152 and will be accessible on demand by the user in the Library. The menu driven design has two advantages: 1) the user can select training for only the sections or individual services requested, and 2) the system design makes it very easy to operate. One of the drawbacks presented by interactive videodisc instructional systems is that after the release videodisc has been recorded, the voice and graphics may need to be updated. At NWMSU this post release videodisc editing, or updating process, is accomplished using a Zenith PC which can overlay graphics and also add and overlay voice instruction using a DECtalk voice synthesizer. The graphics and the voice text are recorded on magnetic diskettes which can be up&ted to keep the courseware current. The synthesizer can also be used to echo or create responses not recorded on the videodisc or the magnetic diskettes. The entire hardware system including the synthesizer is relatively inexpensive when compared to personalized training costs. The major costs are related to video production as with any video system.

Copyright 1986 ACM 0-89791-208-X/86/0900/0177 $0.75 Setting The Direction ACM-SIGUCCS XIV, 1986 177 Jon Rickman, Phillip Heeler, Tracy Corl, Bruce Gehrlein, Scott Land LNTRODUCl7ON A laser instructional videodisc system has many possiblities for showing students how to use computing services. With full motion video and cIose ups or’partial screen close ups, students can be shown many spatial relationships in operating hardware and software systems. Most computing software systems are well defined and associated training needs can also be well defined for the novice user. The cost of developing a video tape or videodisc course can be as high as several thousand dollars a minute if produced by commercial firms. Costs can even be higher in a videodisc course about computing where one is working with a dynamic subject area and small changes or updates require a script change or graphics change in the courseware. Any change in a videodisc course requires that an expensive new disc must be pressed and this may take a week or more if off-premise services are required. Northwest Missouri State University has an enrollment of approximately 5000 students. The Interactive Videodisc Project consisted of three senior computer science students, a computer science professor and the Director of Computer Services. One goal of this research project was to demonstrate to the 5000 students how to use modern intricate computing software within the complex networking environment described in figure 1. The course developers aIso wanted to experiment with various methods of presentation. However, this required the ability to change the courseware components such as the graphics, voice, scenes, or screen text. From the authors’ experiences, it is believed that every course will need several updates each year when using a videodisc system for training in computer services. It is also apparent to the authors that without incorporating some flexibility into the course production process, one can easily give up before a useful course is ever completed. Even with extremely. capable video production crews, more and more of the video production process is moving into the video post production editing room. The authors believe there is a need to expand this powerful process so as to realize a continuum of flexible editing processes. The normal editing process for video production is in three stages: 1. Preproduction editing is where scripts and storyboard plans are reviewed and edited before the camera production process is started. 2. Online production editing is where multiple live cameras and audio inputs are selected in a control room environment at the time of production. 3. Post production editing is where multiple camera and audio recordings from the production process are selected for output to an answer release tape or print. After review and possible iteration of this step, a master release is produced. In videodisc production the answer release is called a check disc. It costs about $200 to $400 to record a check disc from a master release tape. With the system used at NWMSU, another stage of editing is realized. 4. Post release disc editing is where a personal computer selects segments from the release disc and optional non-release disc video and audio tracks to produce the desired presentation at the time of user interaction. This paper describes the system which permits post release disc editing of the courses in academic computing services at NWMSU. New graphics and voice overlays are controlled by the 178 ACM-SIGUCCS XIV, 1986 Setting The Direction A Videodisc Training System for Academic Computing Services Zenith personal computer. HARDWARE AND SOmU SOLUTIONS A videodisc course is composed of full motion video, voice and music presentations and graphics displays. As with a good textbook, graphics can greatly improve the effectiveness of complex courseware. Graphics and lists of procedures inherently contain a high density of information. Unfortunately, entire fact-filled screens of graphics and procedures listings are likely to become outdated whenever any smalI change is needed. Full motion video is very difficult to update and full motion video of someone speaking requires that both video and audio must be overlaid. But many changes can be easily made when text, voice or graphics need updating. The hardware solution which permits post release disc editing of the courseware graphics and voice is shown in figure 2. The AMOCO Foundation awarded Northwest Missouri State University a grant to develop a computer aided instruction system to instruct students on how to use the computing services and library automation services available on campus. This grant was used to purchase the equipment described bel0w.W The system shown in figure 2 was purchased for about $5000 and includes the following parts: Zenith Personal Computer Zenith Color Video Monitor Pioneer LD-WOO0 VideoDisc Player DECtak Voice Synthesizer MicroKey Model 1100 Controller The videodisc player made by Pioneer uses standard play videodiscs. The DECtalk unit was selected since the authors had had several years of experience with the unit. They felt that most script could be understood without phoneme modification which is required by other units on campus. The DECtalk unit also has a multitude of male and female voices which increases its flexibility in editing. The MicroKey controller was chosen because of its ability to interface computer graphics output and videodisc output to the same color monitor. This is important since post release disc editing overlays needed to be displayed on the same screen. The MicroKey controller, in fact, permits composite display of computer and videodisc outputs. The authoring software which came with the controller was found to be inappropriate for the planned development efforts. However, it might be acceptable for other straight-forward applications. Most of the replacement software for the authoring system was done in the BASIC computer language. Using this language the instructional sequences as well as the video scenes, graphics displays, and voice synthesizer output were controlled by a single program. The BASIC system also permitted the authors to present scenes, pause for student interaction, present information from the computer, return back to the video, if necessary, and allow other computer controlled actions to take place.

Traditionally, textual editions have taken different forms for different audiences of readers. Editing protocols, including the critical apparatus, are determined in part by those forms. Mostly this has meant conceiving of a given text as produced for a scholarly, classroom, or popular audience. However different these types of editions, they share familiar textual ontologies, developed primarily over the past 200 years and based on print technology. We suggest instead that editors begin thinking of digital editions primarily as 'editorial environments', with spatial, temporal, procedural, performative, and participatory properties. An electronic edition is always already a virtual world. A digital edition is an electronic environment. Citing as an example our experiment in the MOO with Shelley's sonnet 'Ozymandias', we imagine the role of the editor as textual ecologist/dramaturge/gamemaster, maximizing the resources of digital environments.

This makes visitors of museums possible to purchase postcards, posters, books, and DVDs of pictures and/or movies shown at the exhibition. However, newly developing arts so called interactive art, or new media art, has not been able to be reproduced due to limitation of functionalities of the conventional media. In this article, the authors report a novel approach of sharing such interactive art outside the exhibition, so that the visitors of the museum can take a copy to home, and even share it with non-visitors. The authors build up their new projector-and-camera (ProCam) based interactive artwork for exhibition at Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo (MOT) by using Apple's iPhone. The exactly same software driving this artwork was downloadable from Apple's App Store --- thus all visitors or even non-visitors could enjoy the same experiment at home or wherever they like.	app store;book;image;interactive art;new media;printing;video projector	Ichiroh Kanaya;Masataka Imura;Mayuko Kanazawa	2014		10.1145/2663806.2663871	face detection;entertainment;human–computer interaction;image processing;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-51.96583055640254	-27.87010015387428	188907

Data farming encapsulates the notion of purposeful data generation from simulation models. It uses large-scale designed experiments to facilitate growing simulation output in an efficient and effective fashion, and enables us to explore massive input spaces, uncover interesting features of complex response surfaces, and explicitly identify cause-and-effect relationships. In this presentation, I will weave the two halves of the title together as I recount some key concepts and developments in simulation experimentation, along with experiences and advice drawn from my own data-farming journey.	advice (programming);almanac;causality;complex response;data farming;experience;experiment;response surface methodology;simulation	Susan M.

dcaf283cb1868f795391c8153fa1c14650865031	biomorphic art: an artist's statement		Computer artists are exploring shape, color, and abstract forms in new ways, due in part to the advent of powerful new tools that allow artists to manipulate fractals in a convenient and compelling manner. In this brief artistic note, the artist exhibits some award-winning graphics made with contemporary software. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Ultra Fractal [1] is a versatile fractal plotter for Windows computers that allows artists to explore shape, color, and abstract form in new ways. One convenience factor provided by Ultra Fractal is its use of layers that are superimposed and merged, in much the same way as Adobe Photoshop software permits [2]. Other authors have also recently expressed interest in Ultra Fractal and published a variety of high-quality artworks using this tool [3]. With Ultra Fractal, each image ‘‘layer’’ may have its own fractal formula, spatial location, and coloring algorithm. Users may write their own fractal formulas, coloring algorithms, and transformations, and Ultra Fractal will compile them onthe-fly. In this brief artistic note, I exhibit a gallery of forms created using Ultra Fractal and formulas that control the iteration of complex variables on the complex plane. Traditional Mandelbrot and Julia sets created in this fashion have been described in numerous books and articles [4]. Typically, the trajectory of a point on the complex plane is followed as it meanders on the complex plane under a simple mapping like z-z þ c; and the iteration is stopped when the magnitude of the complex variable exceeds certain thresholds typically denoted by a circular region about the origin. This region may be called an orbit trap. As described by Pickover and many other authors, it is possible to create a filamentous appearance to some of the traditional Mandelbrot and Julia sets by using a novel criterion for monitoring the growth and magnitude of values in the complex iterations [5]. For example, a new criterion may employ orbit traps of different shapes. Some of my images were created using a trap consisting of two concentric circles drawn with their centers on a line between the pixel (initial point on the complex plane) being iterated and the origin, and with a radius that is a certain fraction of the distance between the pixel and the origin. If the value of the iteration enters the region between these two circles, the system determines the distance of the value from the inner circle, and this determines a ‘‘location’’ on a color palette. Additionally, the number of iterations may interact with this distance to control the final color. To make the resulting images more visually interesting, the system divides the color palette into different areas and then selects a certain area depending on the number of iterations. Figs. 1–4 show some recent creations. More information may be obtained at my web site [6]. Fig. 1 won ‘‘best in show’’ award in the 2002 Museum of Computer Art (MOCA) image contest [7]. I hope this very brief note will inspire others to use software tools to create art that may someday rival the work of some of the great modern artists like Joan Miro (1893–1983) and Yves Tanguy (1900–1955). If these artists were alive today, would they be exploring similar computer graphics tools? Because individuals can easily create complex and artistic figures without years of training, one may speculate what this may mean for the future of art and how this will affect what humans consider valuable and attractive in the coming decades.

It is a web-based 3D game platform developed in Unity 3D that currently supports single player use, and in the near future will be developed for multiplayer functionality. This pilot program indeed demonstrates the value of an educational pre-learning tool for parents and students along with the teachers that come to the Fort to re-enact history. Through the use of this game, students have the opportunity to experience educational content and “role-play” in an environment that is immersive and highly interactive. The narrative, digital storytelling, and virtual reconstructions of buildings and environment, all count an accuracy based on scientific, historical and archaeological data. Ultimately, through user interaction, PCs and NPCs (non player characters) create an interesting dialogue between the site (real) and the experience of place (virtual and real).	3d modeling;computer vision;cyberspace;documentation;enactivism;experience;np-completeness;rational clearcase ucm;site map;social presence theory;software release life cycle;unity;virtual reality;web application;world wide web	Maurizio Forte;Nicola Lercari;Llonel Onsurez;Justine Issavi;Elisabeth Prather	2012	2012 18th International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia	10.1109/VSMM.2012.6365940	computer vision;the internet;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;archaeology;virtual reality;multimedia;world wide web	Visualization	-50.75934099960209	-27.76583457151	190719

437beece5cc2323f3cfe07844aa60b26642337e9	preserving computing's past: restoration and simulation	preserving computing	The continuous improvements in computing technology cause the rapid obsolescence of computer systems, architectures, media, and devices. Since old computing systems are rarely perceived to have any value, the danger of losing portions of the computing record is significant. When a computing architecture becomes extinct, its software, data, and written and oral records often disappear with it. Older computer systems embody major investments in software, the value of which may persist long after the systems have lost their technical relevancy. For example, the PDP-11 computer has not been a leading-edge architecture since the introduction of 32-bit systems in the late 1970s and has not received a new hardware implementation since 1984. Nonetheless, PDP-11 systems continue to be used worldwide, particularly in real-time and control applications. The unavailability of suitable replacements of worn-out original parts is a serious issue for PDP-11 systems still in use. Another area of potential loss is data. In recent years, archival storage media have undergone rapid technologic evolution, and the industry standards of computing’s first 30 years, such as 0.5-inch magnetic tape, are now antiques. Salvaging data from original media is an industry-wide problem and has generated a small cottage industry of specialists in data recovery. This problem will only proliferate, as transitions in media types accelerate. Ten years from now, the largediameter optical disks used for today’s archives will look as quaint as DECtape and magnetic tape storage systems do to current computer users. Finally, the disappearance of older equipment typically entails loss of information: not only design sketches, blueprints, and documentation but also the folklore about these systems. The absence of systematic archiving, as well as the absence of a perceived value of the archived data, causes continual information decay about design and operational details. This paper describes two techniques for preserving computing systems of historical interest. The first section of the paper discusses the restoration of old computers to working order.

In this paper, we introduce “The Water-Cycle Ride,” a theme park-esque educational and entertainment ride. By incorporating high definition graphics, surround sound, a motion simulator, and an educational video from NASA-Ames, we introduce a new level of thrill to a subject most would not be interested in. Two riders, secured with a seatbelt and harness, can experience the ride together, which lasts about 3 minutes. Together they are taken through water’s three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and its hydrogeology on earth (runoff, groundwater, etc). At appropriate intervals we introduce g-forces so riders experience a rising feeling when evaporation is being explained, or a falling feeling when rain droplets are racing back to Earth. This paper outlines our novel methodology and results obtained, highlighting how a little thrill and excitement can be introduced to a normally passive subject.		Alexander Redei;Sergiu M.

This method of hypercompression and enlargement exposes the mathematical infrastructure of the JPEG image, i.e. the pixel blocks into which the image is split during the compression process. In so doing, Ruff turns a digital artefact (pixilation) into a default aesthetic, thereby exposing the JPEG as today's default mode of viewing images: online and on-screen. Based on a thorough study of JPEG compression and its artistic use by Ruff, we show that with this shift from geometric projection to algorithmic processing, ‘photographic’ no longer denotes a specific mode of image creation, but rather a specific mode of image processing and that the new ‘architectural order’ of the image is the mathematical matrix used during compression.	codec;jpeg	Ingrid Hoelzl;Remi Marie	2014	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626268.2013.817434	visual arts;the internet;speech recognition;computer science;multimedia;archetype;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-49.95804360073852	-26.924646145776027	193838

Owing to multi-disciplinary nature of real-time embedded systems, imparting exposure and experience in all facets of such systems is challenging. While most existing courses use a variety of hands-on projects to this end, they are usually limited to single-processor designs.  In this paper, we describe a real-time embedded systems project that is being used at the National University of Singapore. The aim of the project is to develop a 5-a-side soccer system on multiple Xilinx FPGA boards using embedded processors. Besides exposing the students to real-time concepts like scheduling, handling shared resources and priority management, the project also makes them appreciate the constraints in a typical embedded system while still making it a fun experience for them. A minicompetition is organized at the end of the project where all teams compete against each other in a knock-out tournament with 5-minute games where the progress of the game is shown on an attached VGA screen. The approach adopted in the project gives students a sense of accomplishment while reinforcing the theoretical concepts. The project has been successfully run for two terms and a similar idea has been applied in another module on embedded systems.	central processing unit;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;hands-on computing;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);video graphics array	Akash Kumar;Shakith Fernando;Manmohan Manoharan	2011		10.1145/2077370.2077377	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;multimedia	Embedded	-48.932527660187894	-29.53601628996574	195436

This paper offers insight into the brief history of those artists whose work utilizes, incorporates or subverts the aesthetics and/or technology of video games. It questions why artwork that subverts consoles is seen less frequently than other emerging forms such as sampling, modifications (mods) and machine cinema (machinima). The paper concludes by offering an examination of obstacles which face artists creating console based subversion and points to these as the reasons why this emerging form is seen with less frequency than the others.	cinema 4d;machinima;mod (video gaming);sampling (signal processing);subversion;video game development	Paul Catanese	2003				HCI	-53.990541644892126	-29.562155329053486	196208

Non-emissive materials that simply change color – such as electronic ink (E-INK) and various photochromic or thermochromic pigments – are more interesting. Textiles with emissive displays are visually appropriate for evening and youth wear, whereas non-emissive textile displays remain closer to the tradition of weaving and textile printing.	diode;e ink;electronic paper;light field;optical fiber;printing;wearable technology	Joanna Berzowska	2004		10.1145/1186223.1186266	computer graphics (images);change color;inkwell;optoelectronics;textile;brightness;weaving;light-emitting diode;electroluminescence;computer science	HCI	-52.317123475448824	-29.739404444470036	197215

The 1968 studio placed Goldsmiths at the forefront of such developments in the UK university sector. 2008 also marks the launch of our EMS Research Group, which brings together a diverse range of interests and activities in computer music research, creative practice and music technology. 1. GOLDSMITHS: THEN AND NOW The early history of the studio is closely linked to two British pioneers of experimental, electronic music: Hugh Davies (1943-2005) and Daphne Oram (19252003). Interest in electronic music at Goldsmiths can be traced back to 1966 and a visit by Oram, co-founder and director (1958-9) of the BBC Radiophonic workshop. (Her life and work is the subject of a current EMS research project, outlined below). A letter to Oram dated May 3rd 1966, from J.A. Gulland, Head of the Department of Adult Studies, thanked her for a recent lecture, concluding """"I am not quite sure what we as a College do next about electronic music but you have certainly stimulated very great interest that may, in time, develop into a serious study of the subject here”. Interest developed quickly. In autumn 1967 Hugh Davies, following his two-year tenure in Germany as Stockhausen’s assistant, proposed the establishing of a Goldsmiths electronic music studio to Stanley Glasser, who was soon to be Head of the Music Department. By January 1968 the ‘Electronic Music Workshop’ had begun evening classes. Davies writes “This appears to have been the first such regular class given in any academic institution in Britain, although others followed fairly rapidly.” 1 [4]. Initial equipment consisted of “three Revox tape recorders, a stereo mixer, one air and a couple of contact microphones, a stereo amplifier and loudspeakers, followed a few weeks later by a sine/square-wave generator built from a kit.” [4]. By 1976 this had expanded to include two VCS3 synthesizers, numerous Revox A77 tape recorders, a custom-made mixer, a range of ring-modulators, phaseshifters, wave-shapers, reverberation units etc., and a few years later the addition of a Roland 100M modular synthesizer (still working today). In the 1980s the studio acquired a Fairlight CMI series II computer music 1 A claim supported by Prof. Peter Manning: “...there were developments at York, Cardiff and Manchester underway by 1968 but Hugh's claim to be the first is sustainable” (email correspondence, 28/1/08). system, at the time extremely expensive technology (Figure 1). Over the years there have been numerous composers and artists associated with the studio, as performers-inresidence, researchers and visiting tutors, including Don Banks, Anna Lockwood, Lawrence Casserley, David Burnard, Lily Greenham, Bob Cobbing (poet in residence, 1973-74), Richard Bernas, and more recently, Philip Mead, New Noise London, Max Eastley, Lawrence Upton, and Neil Heyde. Composer, Katharine Norman (EMS Director, 1998-2003), oversaw an extensive modernization of the studio and also established undergraduate and postgraduate courses that continue today. Hugh Davies is sadly no longer with us, although his influence remains; one obituary noted that “in the 21st century, it seems that Hugh Davies's innovatory, do-ityourself, lo-fi approach – which in several respects prefigured present laptop culture – is finding favour with a younger generation to whom this remarkable and iconoclastic innovator now appears as a significant father figure.” [8]. The current EMS Research Group staff includes Ian Stonehouse (Head of Studio), Dr. Michael Young (Deputy Head of Department, Lecturer in Composition), Dr. John Levack Drever (Lecturer in Composition), Dr. Mick Grierson (AHRC Research Fellow), John Lely (Researcher and Technician) and Sebastian Lexer (Researcher and Max/MSP Course Tutor).

CURRENT RESOURCES The Electronic Music Studios comprises a suite of eight independent studios, offering a range of facilities for teaching and research. There are three identical Pro Tools Studios based around a Digidesign Mbox Pro 2/Apple iMac system. The Music Technology Lab supports both undergraduate and commercial courses with 10 Mac and PC workstations running Sibelius, Cubase and Max/MSP. Other frequently used software includes IRCAM Forum software, MetaSynth 4 Pro, Soundhack, Ableton Live, and a range of plugins such as GRM Classic & ST, Pluggo and Waves. Our Teaching Studio space houses another Digidesign workstation, in addition to a Yamaha Disklavier grand piano and a vintage Roland 100M modular synthesizer, which still attracts regular use. The studio is used for seminars, workshops, installation development and recording; an adjacent Control Room is equipped for multitrack recording, comprising Digidesign HD2 Accel/192 hardware, a Yamaha O2R desk, Genelec monitors, TL Audio Preamp & Compressor and TFPRO pre-amplifiers/stereo optical compressors. There are also tie lines to the Department of Music Recital Room for remote recording. Figure 2: The Multichannel Studio today There are three studios specifically for postgraduate/research use: The Multichannel Studio is the main facility, designed for eight-channel or 5:1 sound diffusion/spatialisation and digital sound processing/editing (Figure 2). It is based around an Apple G5 and Digidesign HD2 Accel system, with eight Adam active speakers and subwoofer with a dual Blue Sky controller. Additional software includes IRCAM SPAT real-time spatialisation, and a custom-made realtime eight-channel spatialisation RTAS plug-in. The new 5.1 Studio is designed specifically for surround sound composition with an Apple Mac Pro, Digidesign HD2 Accel system, Adam active speakers and a Blue Sky controller. It also equipped for reel-to-reel tape transfer. The Live Electronics Studio is a facility for interactive performance and live signal processing. Equipment includes an Apple Mac Pro 3GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon with a range of control surfaces and external equipment inlcuding a JazzMutant Lemur, Korg KAOSS pad, Kenton Control Freak, Phil Rees C16 and Soundbeam 2 system. 3. CURRENT RESEARCH 3.1. Interactive Performance/Composition Interactive and generative music in performance is well represented in EMS, evidenced by the Live Algorithms for Music Network (LAM) as well as individual research projects. 3.1.1. Live Algorithms for Music The LAM network was founded by Dr Michael Young and Dr Tim Blackwell (Department of Computing, Goldsmiths) with a grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Culture and Creativity Programme. The vision for the network is the development of an artificial music collaborator in performance [1], and the main aim of the network has been to form an interdisciplinary community to identify theoretical and practical issues. The community has been developed through a series of events hosted by EMS, which facilitated research workshops and concerts. During 2004-7 there were 40 presentations and 27 performances of live algorithminspired music (Figure 3). The network has some 100 members including performers, composers, software engineers and researchers in relevant sciences; computing, cognition, robotics. Although UK-based, there are many members from other European countries, Australia and the USA. The network has benefited from contributions by leaders in improvised and computer music including Prof. George Lewis (Columbia University, USA), Al Biles (Rochester Inst. Technology, USA) and Francois Pachet (Sony CSL). LAM established links with international conferences NIME 2006 and ISMIR 2006 and with IRCAM.
