The main innovation is a new key exchange message constructed in a manner that ensures an adversary can neither hide the fact that a message was transmitted, nor alter its payload without being detected. Thus, any attempt by an adversary to interfere with the key exchange translates into the pairing devices detecting either invalid pairing messages or an unacceptable increase in the number of such messages. We analytically prove that our design is secure against MITM attacks, and show that our protocol is practical by implementing a prototype using off-the-shelf 802.11 cards. An evaluation of our protocol on two busy wireless networks (MIT’s campus network and a reproduction of the SIGCOMM 2010 network using traces) shows that it can effectively implement key exchange in a real-world environment.	adversary (cryptography);key exchange;prototype;sensor;tracing (software)	Shyamnath Gollakota;Nabeel Ahmed;Nickolai Zeldovich;Dina Katabi	2011			computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-53.04489119607938	69.65198490547742	183594
00d4330e0238231950984d1246670d587cf85805	a regulation-based security evaluation method for data link in wireless sensor network		This article presents a novel approach to the analysis of wireless sensor networks (WSN) security, based on the regulations intended forwireless communication devices. Starting from the analysis and classification of attacks, countermeasures, and available protocols, we present the current state on secure communication stacks for embedded systems.The regulation analysis is based on civil EN 50150 and MIL STD-188-220, both applicable to WSN communications. Afterwards, starting from a list of known WSN attacks, we use a correspondence table tomatchWSNattackswith countermeasures required by regulations.This approach allows us to produce a precise security evaluation and classificationmethodology forWSN protocols.The results show that current protocols do not present a complete coverage of security issues. While this conclusion is already known for manyWSN protocols, to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a complete methodology is proposed to base this assertion. Moreover, by using the proposed methodology, we are able to precisely identify the exposed threats for each WSN protocol under analysis.

A primary reason for markets not adopting this technology is its failure to provide adequate security. Data that is sent over wireless links can be compromised with utmost ease. In this project, we propose a distributed agent based intrusion detection and response system for wireless LANs that can detect unauthorized wireless elements like access points, wireless clients that are in promiscuous mode etc. The system reacts to intrusions by either notifying the concerned personnel, in case of rogue access points and promiscuous nodes, or by blocking unauthorized users from accessing the network resources.

ea4bb6c4c12261cad466755a0b8a405e578ccceb	exploration of singular spectrum analysis for online anomaly detection in crns		Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been recognized as a promising technology that allows secondary users (SUs) extensively explore spectrum resource usage efficiency, while not introducing interference to licensed users. Due to the unregulated wireless network environment, CRNs are susceptible to various malicious entities. Thus, it is critical to detect anomalies in the first place. However, from the perspective of intrinsic features of CRNs, there is hardly in existence of an universal applicable anomaly detection scheme. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) has been theoretically proven an optimal approach for accurate and quick detection of changes in the characteristics of a running (random) process. In addition, SSA is a model-free method and no parametric models have to be assumed for different types of anomalies, which makes it a universal anomaly detection scheme. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive parameter and component selection mechanism based on coherence for basic SSA method, upon which we built up a sliding window online anomaly detector in CRNs. Our experimental results indicate great accuracy of the SSA-based anomaly detector for multiple anomalies.	algorithm;anomaly detection;cognitive radio;entity;entity–relationship model;ibm notes;interference (communication);one-class classification;online and offline;parametric model;power usage effectiveness;real-time web;stochastic process	Qi Dong;Zekun Yang;Yu Chen;Xiaohua Li;Kai Zeng	2017	ICST Trans.

fba6163001809d9ff4033ace1e6c182af44551cc	a traffic signal control system through anonymous messages		This work proposes a dynamic and flexible approach to guide traffic congestion based on anonymous messages delivered by the vehicles in the proximity of a crossroad. The system uses real-time traffic information to determine the state of the traffic flows at a signalized intersection in order to schedule the traffic lights efficiently. A vehicle, modeled as automaton, securely disseminate and exchange its internal state with a trusted traffic authority in a wireless communication. A roadside unit, installed at the road intersection, collects the traffic information, verifies the information, and uses a phase-based control algorithm to optimize the amount of the vehicles entering the intersection. The new approach has been evaluated through simulation under light and heavy traffic conditions, and the results compared with fixed-time traffic signal control and Webster's method.	algorithm;automaton;certificate authority;control system;encryption;network congestion;real-time clock;simulation	Mukremin Ozkul;Elton Domnori	2017	2017 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2017.7995893	traffic generation model;vehicle information and communication system;traffic optimization;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;computer network;floating car data;traffic conflict;traffic bottleneck;computer security;traffic policing;engineering	Embedded	-54.51824026858452	73.89637543112381	184705
1aa902bb01bfb16fea6cc46a621380eb77a4018c	link: location verification through immediate neighbors knowledge		In many location-based services, the user location is determined on the mobile device and then shared with the service. For this type of interaction, a major problem is how to prevent service abuse by malicious users who lie about their location. This paper proposes LINK (Location verification through Immediate Neighbors Knowledge), a location authentication protocol in which users help verify each other’s location claims. This protocol is independent of the wireless network carrier, and thus works for any third-party service. For each user’s location claim, a centralized Location Certification Authority (LCA) receives a number of verification messages from neighbors contacted by the claimer using short-range wireless networking such as Bluetooth. The LCA decides whether the claim is authentic or not based on spatio-temporal correlation between the users, trust scores associated with each user, and historical trends of the trust scores. LINK thwarts attacks from individual malicious claimers or malicious verifiers. Over time, it also detects attacks involving groups of colluding users.	authentication protocol;bluetooth;centralized computing;certificate authority;location-based service;malware;mobile device;simulation	Manoop Talasila;Reza Curtmola;Cristian Borcea	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-29154-8_18	machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining	Mobile	-50.70467447673553	71.59584895533654	185881

During the card reply, the reader generates an appropriate noise that is modulated by the load of the card. By knowing the noise it emitted, the reader is able to subtract it and to retrieve the card message when a spying probe in the eld is ine cient.	algorithm;computer simulation;encryption;image noise;modulation;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;noise (electronics);public-key cryptography;radio-frequency identification;secure channel;smart card;spectral density;subcarrier	O.

eb07f1ea79feeda0612cb4b04ee29a9b0c3e4073	a study on authentication and access control of wireless access point		When a client is accessing a wireless AP, many methodologies which prevent from external attack or internal information leakage using only authorized wireless AP after deciding authorized/unauthorized have proposed. But there are securities and cost problem in server based authentication, and availability problem in client based authentication. In this paper, we use MAC Address to get an authentication from an AP. It searches the NDIS Intermediate Driver from the wireless network card, and then controls the packets after operating the scope of IP and PORT. We have implemented the proposed model, and it showed no more security and cost problem. It also showed that client based authentication availability is very flexible and has high scalability.	access control;authentication;wireless access point	Jong-Kyung Baek;Jae-Pyo Park	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27180-9_24	network admission control;media access control;computer access control;inter-access point protocol;wi-fi protected access;access control;authentication protocol;wireless network;multi-factor authentication;wireless distribution system;wireless lan controller;capwap;wi-fi array;rogue access point;network access control;hidden node problem;computer network;network access point;network access device	Security	-48.69877560498202	71.21220023972384	190260

More specifically, the security measures applied to protect the mobile users, the radio access network, the fixed part of the network, and the related data of GPRS are presented and analyzed in details. This analysis reveals the security weaknesses of the applied measures that may lead to the realization of security attacks by adversaries. These attacks threaten network operations and data transfer through it compromising end-users and network security. To address some of the identified security weaknesses, a set of security enhancements that aims at improving the GPRS security architecture and providing advanced security services to user data traffic is proposed. The proposed enhancements can be easily integrated in the existing GPRS technology, minimizing the required changes.	computer security;network security;radio access network	Christos Xenakis	2008	I.

Users wish to maintain location privacy and anonymity, meaning the identity, location/direction of move of their vehicles remains unknown to everybody with possible exception law enforcement authorities responsible by law to know and maintain such private information. In this paper, we propose a Pre-broadcast based Time Efficient Privacy (PTEP) scheme, which, instead of performing any asymmetric verification, uses Message Authentication Code (MAC) functionality and HASH operations to authenticate messages. Moreover, we use two-level key (upper-level hash chain and low-level hash chain) which assists avoiding message losses. Analysis shows that the proposed PTEP scheme superior performance in terms of packet loss rate and packet latency. In addition, it can be used to serve emergency and routine messages as well, while most of existing solutions can only work with routine messages.	hash chain;high- and low-level;message authentication code;network packet;personally identifiable information;privacy	Bidi Ying;Dimitrios Makrakis;H.

Due to the limited resource constraint in wireless sensor network, security in protocols is sacrificed or kept minimal. The distributive and self-organizing nature of sensor based on environment requires protocol to be adaptive, energy efficient and secure. In this paper, we analyze the different encryption schemes and their shortcoming in providing an energy efficient solution for sensor network. Secondly, we propose a communication protocol that balances resources while achieving mission critical solution using bio-inspired multi-objective algorithm. Thirdly, the accuracy of threat detection is analyzed using threshold approach based on sensor characteristics.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;business models for open-source software;communications protocol;embedded system;encryption;home automation;mission critical;organizing (structure);self-organization;sensor;threat (computer)	Rajani Muraleedharan;Lisa Ann Osadciw	2009	2009 6th Annual International Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking & Services, MobiQuitous		sensor web;embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;information security;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	-52.09306951707354	74.5120151771223	193421

But the security concern of such network, especially the core network, is far from being satisfied. With the continuously development in the security enhancement in RAN, core network would become the future target of attackers. GPRS Tunnel Protocol (GTP), which is one of the key protocols in the core network, is quite vulnerable to attacks in the flat, full IP environment. Therefore solving such problem properly is very urgent and important for the operation of 3G network. In this paper, the security challenges in the 3G core network and the security issues in GTP are discussed, a defense solution for these security threats and an eventbased description language are proposed. The experiment result shows the potential of our solution.	protocol stack;prototype	Xuena Peng;Yingyou Wen;Hong Zhao	2011	JNW	10.4304/jnw.6.5.823-830	computer security model;gtp';cloud computing security;embedded system;intelligent computer network;security through obscurity;core network;security information and event management;security association;telecommunications;asset;computer science;information security;network security;operating system;unified threat management;internet security;security service;distributed computing;security testing;network access control;network security policy;world wide web;computer security;intrusion prevention system;host based security system;computer network	Security	-52.048795431928625	70.4726058050586	193615

Indeed, SCADA systems are used to manage critical installations that have hard security, reliability and real-time requirements. Consequently, in order to ensure Wireless Industrial Sensor Networks (WISN) security, Intrusion Detection Systems should be used as a second line of defense, in addition to sensor’s embedded security mechanisms. In this paper, we present wIDS a multilayer specification-based Intrusion Detection System specially tailored for WISN. It has a two-level detection architecture and is based on a formal description of node’s normal behavior.	behavior model;data acquisition;embedded system;intrusion detection system;performance;real-time locating system;reflection (computer graphics);requirement;sensor;simulation;wireless intrusion prevention system	Lyes Bayou;David Espes;Nora Cuppens-Boulahia;Frédéric Cuppens	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72598-7_24	computer security;architecture;wireless sensor network;computer science;intrusion detection system;wireless;scada	Security	-50.60861875573277	68.30490595668493	193730

However, NFC is vulnerable to numerous networking attacks such as tag manipulation. In this paper, a security-aware architecture is introduced to protect the NFC devices and associated data from several attacks. The proposed NFC system has a secure protocol, connected to the NFC chip. The NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) message is enriched with a certificate record. The proposed NFC system checks the authenticity of the sender first; then if appropriate, processes the incoming NDEF messages and stores them in device memory. The proposed NFC system is simulated using MATLAB. Simulation results suggest that the proposed protocol offers better security by detecting certificate modification, message modification, etc. It is also observed that the processing time remains almost the same for various record sizes and the processing time slightly increases as the certificate size increases. Therefore, the proposed NFC architecture has potential to be used in IoT devices.	cryptographic protocol;internet of things;matlab;near field communication;radio jamming;scalability;sensor;simulation	Abu Asaduzzaman;Shanta Mazumder;Sergio Salinas;Muhammad F.

However, it should be able to provide a high level of security by considering the different aspects such as authentication mechanisms. The current 4G AKA protocols designed to address the AAA needs present some weaknesses and will also be impacted by the new requirements of 5G systems.

In this paper, we have proposed two 802.1x DoS attacks, EAP-NAK and EAP-Notification flooding attacks. These effectively disrupt the authentication process between the legitimate wireless supplicants and the network authentication server. The evaluation of these attacks against EAP is performed using well-suited metrics which highlight their impact on the targeted network in practice. Furthermore, we discuss possible techniques to detect these attacks, such as configuring the WIDS to create a performance baseline of the wireless network. Lastly, several techniques and solutions were discussed which can be applied to the 802.11i standard in order to enhance the security of the 802.1x for dealing with DoS attacks, such as the use of a process delay time technique.	acknowledgement (data networks);authentication server;baseline (configuration management);denial-of-service attack;ieee 802.11i-2004;ieee 802.1x;server (computing);wireless intrusion prevention system	Abdulrahman Alruban;Emlyn Everitt	2011	2011 European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference	10.1109/EISIC.2011.49	message authentication code;communications protocol;robust random early detection;wi-fi protected setup;computer science;network security;wireless network;authentication;internet privacy;computer security;server;computer network	Security	-55.153942761434486	69.46449324788894	195320

For the generation of a unique pair of encryption module (EM) and decryption module (DM), learning algorithms are applied in combination with biometric data of the future DM-user. Subsequently, EM can be attached to any computer to form a generally usable encryption unit (EU) while DM, if attached to another computer to form the matching decryption unit (DU), can only be activated by the specific pair-generating DM-user. EU transforms spatial data to temporal data by means of spatio-temporal (ST) filters. DU uses a combination of analytical- and learning algorithms for decryption.	algorithm;biometrics;machine learning;secure communication	Dirk Neumann;Rolf Eckmiller;Oliver Baruth	2007	Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering		computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;data mining;computer security	EDA	-48.70336163777444	69.0528397109077	195501
f977fd0454e7edea8e29ba8a7b0fb7aeb58826a5	an improved and anonymous two-factor authentication protocol for health-care applications with wireless medical sensor networks		Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are fast developed and widely used in many applications. One of the most important applications is wireless medical sensor network (WMSN) which makes modern health-care more popular. The doctor can get the patient’s physiological data collected by special sensors deployed on or in the patient’s body in real time with the mobile devices via the wireless communication channel. The collected data are important and should be confidential. So security measures are considered in the process of communication. Recently, He et al. (Multimed Syst, 21(1), 49–60, 2015) proposed a new two-factor authentication scheme for health-care with WMSNs and claimed it to be secure. But we find that it is vulnerable to the off-line guessing attack, the user impersonation attack, and the sensor node capture attack. Moreover, we present an improved scheme to overcome the disadvantages. Through the formal verification with Proverif and the analysis presented by us, our scheme is secure. It is more practical for applications through the comparison between some recent schemes for WMSNs.	authentication protocol;channel (communications);confidentiality;formal verification;mobile device;multi-factor authentication;online and offline;proverif;sensor node	Fan Wu;Lili Xu;Saru Kumari;Xiong Li	2015	Multimedia Systems	10.1007/s00530-015-0476-3	computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-49.871882496502806	73.29134590828866	195670

However, secure communication can only be provided after successful authentication and a robust security network association is established. In general, the wireless link layer is not protected by the current standard in WLANs, which leads to many possible attacks, especially in public open-access wireless networks. We argue that regardless of the type of network under consideration, link-layer protection and data confidentiality are of great importance in wireless applications. In this paper, we first identify and analyze the security issues ignored by the current 802.11 security standard. Then we propose our solution to patch the current 802.11i standard and address all those issues with a new dummy authentication key-establishment algorithm. Dummy means no real authentication for a user. In dummy authentication, we apply public-key cryptography's key-establishment technique to the 802.11 MAC protocol. Our solution can provide link-layer data encryption in open-access wireless networks, separate session encryption keys for different users, and protection for important frames such as management and null data frames as well as Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) messages.	algorithm;confidentiality;dummy variable (statistics);encryption;extensible authentication protocol;ibm notes;ieee 802.11i-2004;mutual authentication;public-key cryptography;secure communication;session key	Zhimin Yang;Adam C.

a15dff9782ca47e298fbe9733c98d2720cb242f7	bridging the air gap between isolated networks and mobile phones in a practical cyber-attack		Information is the most critical asset of modern organizations, and accordingly it is one of the resources most coveted by adversaries. When highly sensitive data is involved, an organization may resort to air gap isolation in which there is no networking connection between the inner network and the external world. While infiltrating an air-gapped network has been proven feasible in recent years, data exfiltration from an air-gapped network is still considered one of the most challenging phases of an advanced cyber-attack. In this article, we present “AirHopper,” a bifurcated malware that bridges the air gap between an isolated network and nearby infected mobile phones using FM signals. While it is known that software can intentionally create radio emissions from a video card, this is the first time that mobile phones serve as the intended receivers of the maliciously crafted electromagnetic signals. We examine the attack model and its limitations and discuss implementation considerations such as modulation methods, signal collision, and signal reconstruction. We test AirHopper in an existing workplace at a typical office building and demonstrate how valuable data such as keylogging and files can be exfiltrated from physically isolated computers to mobile phones at a distance of 1--7 meters, with an effective bandwidth of 13--60 bytes per second.	air gap (networking);attack model;bridging (networking);byte;computer;data rate units;data theft;fm broadcasting;keystroke logging;malware;mobile phone;modulation;signal reconstruction;video card	Mordechai Guri;Matan Monitz;Yuval Elovici	2017	ACM TIST	10.1145/2870641	collision;software;cyber-attack;keystroke logging;malware;computer security;tempest;attack model;bridging (networking);computer science	Security	-54.14485547447168	70.23256556501192	196401

By adding a security service layer, PKey is carefully built on the base of a routing and location layer to simple the application development. According as the layered architecture of PKey, some key protocols of PKey, which include key producing, retrieving and transferring, are designed and analyzed in detail. Other important aspects of this new kind of distributed key management system are also addressed and analyzed.	key management;peer-to-peer;routing;security service (telecommunication);service layer	Shijie Zhou;Zhiguang Qin;Jinde Liu	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-24679-4_85	telecommunications;computer science;multitier architecture;operating system;key management;database;distributed computing;rapid application development;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-48.36190593889865	70.92291829440991	196884

Various schemes for extracting symmetric cryptographic keys out of wireless channel properties have been proposed during recent years, making the generation protocol more and more efficient for individual applications. However, often these schemes were evaluated based on theoretical models and without considering practical effects. We present a system for PHY-based key generation with two legitimate users as well as a passive attacker of equivalent power and analyze results from practical measurements in real world scenarios. Furthermore we extend practical constraints by considering heterogeneous setups and show the impact onto representative performance indicators.	internet of things;key (cryptography);key generation;phy (chip);program optimization;vii	Rene Guillaume;Fredrik Winzer;Andreas Czylwik;Christian T.

fef3feb39ed95a4376019af8dbfe604643fb7f25	faster dual-key stealth address for blockchain-based internet of things systems		Stealth address prevents public association of a blockchain transaction’s output with a recipient’s wallet address and hides the actual destination address of a transaction. While stealth address provides an effective privacy-enhancing technology for a cryptocurrency network, it requires blockchain nodes to actively monitor all the transactions and compute the purported destination addresses, which restricts its application for resource-constrained environments like Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose DKSAP-IoT, a faster dual-key stealth address protocol for blockchain-based IoT systems. DKSAP-IoT utilizes a technique similar to the TLS session resumption to improve the performance and reduce the transaction size at the same time between two communication peers. Our theoretical analysis as well as the extensive experiments on an embedded computing platform demonstrate that DKSAPIoT is able to reduce the computational overhead by at least 50% when compared to the state-of-the-art scheme, thereby paving the way for its application to blockchain-based IoT systems.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;cryptographic hash function;embedded system;experiment;internet of things;overhead (computing);privacy;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);shared secret;stealth	Xinxin Fan	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94478-4_9	computer security;overhead (computing);cryptocurrency;blockchain;computer science;internet of things;distributed computing;database transaction	Security	-50.7951897998085	73.29904417563819	197832
423b1d4d75293a7f1cf61932e71480ac03ae103c	dancing on the lip of the volcano: chosen ciphertext attacks on apple imessage		Apple’s iMessage is one of the most widely-deployed end-to-end encrypted messaging protocols. Despite its broad deployment, the encryption protocols used by iMessage have never been subjected to rigorous cryptanalysis. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of iMessage to determine the security of the protocol against a variety of attacks. Our analysis shows that iMessage has significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a sophisticated attacker. In particular, we outline a novel chosen ciphertext attack on Huffman compressed data, which allows retrospective decryption of some iMessage payloads in less than 218 queries. The practical implication of these attacks is that any party who gains access to iMessage ciphertexts may potentially decrypt them remotely and after the fact. We additionally describe mitigations that will prevent these attacks on the protocol, without breaking backwards compatibility. Apple has deployed our mitigations in the latest iOS and OS X releases.	backward compatibility;chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext;cryptanalysis;cryptographic protocol;data compression;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;huffman coding;software deployment;threaded code;ios	Christina Garman;Matthew Green;Gabriel Kaptchuk;Ian Miers;Michael Rushanan	2016			internet privacy;computer security	Security	-52.72911323223956	69.41946090560603	197900
