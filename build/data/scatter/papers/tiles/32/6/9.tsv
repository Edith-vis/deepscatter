0bcdd8db3df76aec579c1e5e7c03f0316774bdc5	exploring the use of educational technology in primary education: teachers' perception of mobile technology learning impacts and applications' use in the classroom	learning impact;applications use;primary education;mobile technology	Mobile technology has become popular worldwide with a broad range of users, including students from all levels of education. Although the impact of mobile technology in classrooms has been extensively studied, less is known about teachers' perceptions of how mobile technology impacts in learning and its relation to Applications (Apps) use in the classroom. This state of affairs is problematic since we know that teachers' perceptions have a great influence on their teaching practices. This study used survey data gathered from 102 teachers of 12 different primary schools in Spain. The questionnaire collected data about teachers' individual information, teachers' perceptions on the impact of mobile technology in learning, and use of a set of selected Apps in the classroom. Findings suggest that facilitating access to information and increasing engagement to learning are the two main impacts of mobile technology in the classroom. Findings also show that the choice of Apps is related to the teachers' perception of how mobile technology impacts in learning. Findings could help teachers to take advantage of the combination of affordances of mobile technology and Apps that actually improve some aspects of learning practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

460d5cf09333a177aefc9d16b99e43d03dbdbf7e	an xapi application profile to monitor self-regulated learning strategies		Self-regulated learning (SRL) is being promoted and adopted increasingly due to the needs of current education, student centered and focused on competence development. One of the main components of SRL is learners’ self-monitoring, which eventually contributes to a better performance. Monitoring is also important for teachers, as it enables them to know to what extent their learners are doing well and progressing properly. At the same time, the use of technology for learning is now common and facilitates monitoring. Nevertheless, the available software still offers poor support from the SRL point of view, especially, for SRL monitoring. This clashes with the growth of learning analytics and educational data mining. The main issue is the wide variety of SRL actions that need to be captured, commonly performed in different tools, and the need to integrate them to support the development of analytics and data mining developments, making imperative the search of interoperable solutions. This paper focuses on the standardization of SRL traces to enable data collection from multiple sources and data analysis with the goal of easing the monitoring process for teachers and learners. First, the paper analyzes current monitoring software and its limitations for SRL. Then, after a brief analysis of available standards on this area, an application profile for the eXperience API specification is proposed to enable the interoperable recording of the SRL traces. The paper describes the process followed to create the profile, from the analysis to the final implementation, including the selection of the interactions that represent relevant SRL actions, the selection of vocabularies to record them and a case study.	application programming interface;educational data mining;imperative programming;interaction;interoperability;tracing (software);vocabulary	Mario Manso-V&#x00E1;zquez;Manuel Caeiro-Rodr&#x00ED;guez;Mart&#x00ED;n Llamas-Nistal	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2860519	task analysis;data collection;data mining;standardization;distributed computing;application profile;computer science;self-regulated learning;analytics;learning analytics;educational data mining	HCI	-76.94466649826842	-44.364947194718006	183902

In our experiment, participants (10 visual learners and 9 verbal learners) categorized by Felder’s index of learning styles learned information science by watching the video content composed of 6 slides. The participants watched the content on the YouTube and used variable-speed playback functionality: 0.5×; 1.0×; 1.25×: 1.5×; 2.0× and we recorded participants’ behaviors by using video cameras and measured how long they spent using the functionality. We applied ANOVA to the participants’ scores on the comprehension test, mean responses for the questionnaire, and the mean percentage of functionality-usage time duration. The comprehension test results indicated no signify discrepancies between visual learners and verbal learners. Questionnaire survey showed that verbal learners felt significantly less difficulty on the slide 2. The functionality usage time duration indicated that verbal learners spent significantly longer time duration watching the video content at 2.0× speed. Those findings suggest the possibility that verbal learners tend to use the hi-speed playback functionality longer than visual learners when they feel less difficulty on educational slides.

However, little is known about the internal and external factors/experiences causing students to decide to drop-out. This study considers the gateway experiences (B.S. to M.S.) that led six STEM college students to continue to pursue their master's degree. This paper will present a novel method to triangulate affective responses of participants as they recollect their college experiences. We will discuss the graduate student case studies by comparing gender. The information presented highlights interview summaries from the graduate students, physiological instrumentation data including: (1) wireless non-invasive wrist sensors to measure skin electrical conductance (electrodermal activity) as a trigger for emotional response, (2) wired pulse oximeters to non-invasively monitor an individual's heart rate, and (3) preliminary detection of heart rate using a custom-developed, non-invasive/non-contact video monitoring technology presented for the first time in this paper. Together, the findings present a unique method to assess emotional and decision-making responses of students. Through this work, we hope to develop future research strategies that are qualitatively and quantitatively based for the target population.	conductance (graph);experience;sensor	Idalis Villanueva;Adam C Raikes;Nathan Ruben;Sydney Schaefer;Jacob H.

The current study implemented a method to extract keyword cues from e-books to support e-book reading with the read, recite and review 3R strategy, and then examined the impact of this on children's reading performance. A pilot work recruited 76 first-graders, developed the related reading tests and questionnaires. These were later used in assessing the effects of different interventions on the reading performances and perspectives of 74 first-graders in the main study. Based on the findings of this work, the 3R strategy can be used as an effective approach to guide children's reading with e-books. In addition, the use of keyword cues incorporated with retrieval practice can provide support with regard to Chinese characters and phonetic information in order to aid children's memorization of the story, thus promoting both phonological awareness and reading comprehension.	e-book	T.-H.

24d68788dee21cbaa25d4f8c456ac1346aa8dbc5	the effect of hybrid learning in vocational education based on cloud space: taking the vocational education cyber-platform as an example		In recent years, instructors have had an increasing interest in integrating cloud-based education platform into their classroom as part of the learning environment, especially in China’s vocational education. Hunan provincial Vocational Education Cyber-Platform (VECP) is the largest vocational education cloud in China. Compared with other information systems, vocational students’ attitude, effect and behavioral intention towards hybrid learning have not been assessed and thoroughly understood. This paper analyses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in order to examine students’ behavioral intention to use an electronic portfolio system. A Hybrid Learning Usage Questionnaire was developed using existing scales from prior TAM instruments and modified where appropriate. In our survey, 180 students completed the questionnaire measuring their responses to perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitudes towards usage (ATU) and behavioral intention to use (BIU) the VECP. The results of the study indicated that students’ perceived ease of use (PEOU) had a significant influence on attitude towards usage (ATU). Subsequently, perceived ease of use (PEOU) had the strongest significant influence on perceived usefulness (PU). The research further demonstrated that individual characteristics, technological factors and training experience may have a significant influence on instructors in adopting cloud-based hybrid learning into their courses in vocational education.

According to IBSE principles, learners should investigate and manipulate in order to become conscious of the origin of astronomical phenomena, construct scientific knowledge and change their misconceptions. In primary French schools, physical models are usually used. However, children do not take advantage of these models and form new synthetic models instead of scientific ones. We aim at providing an adapted pedagogical environment support. An Augmented Reality environment was designed for inquiry-based learning. This tangible AR model shows augmented views of the celestial bodies and supports the pupils' investigations using spatial visual guides and views from a terrestrial observer. The AR model not only exposes the phenomena as in several Virtual Environments, but also allows pupils to virtually move the celestial bodies and test """"as for real"""" their hypotheses. Our results show that the AR environment is particularly suitable for astronomy learning compared to the physical one. Only AR users have developed scientific conceptions of the explored astronomical phenomena and learnings have been significantly improved. Furthermore, we present some arguments in order to support the assumption that the AR model assists the process of scaffolding and motivation dynamic by enhancing task controllability and by promoting collaborative learning."""	ar (unix);augmented reality;autoregressive model;celestial coordinate system;exploratory testing;synthetic intelligence;terrestrial television	Stéphanie Fleck;Gilles Simon	2013		10.1145/2534903.2534907	simulation;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-71.61630663680036	-40.75333146338184	186924

This study examines how spendency relates to students’ interaction preferences, in-system performance, and learning outcomes (i.e., self-explanation quality, comprehension). A group of 40 high school students interacted with iSTART-ME as part of an 11-session experiment (pretest, eight training sessions, posttest, and a delayed retention test). Students’ spendency was negatively related to the frequency of their use of personalizable features. In addition, students’ spendency was negatively related to their in-system achievements, daily learning outcomes, and performance on a transfer comprehension task, even after factoring out prior ability. The findings from this study indicate that increases in students’ spendency are systematically related to their selection choices and may have a negative effect on in-system performance, immediate learning outcomes, and skill transfer outcomes. The results have particular relevance to game-based systems that incorporate currency to unlock features within games as well as to the differential tradeoffs of game features on motivation and learning.	integer factorization;relevance;unlockable game	Erica L.

Therefore, it is interesting to think of providing tools which support teachers to deal with those challenges. Cognitor is an authoring tool that helps teachers to develop web based learning material, aiming to support teachers to develop learning content which can integrate learners from different culture background, during the learning process, and which can be easily understood, through the use of common sense knowledge, i.e. the knowledge shared by people inserted into the same cultural context. This paper presents a usability test on Cognitor and discusses some preliminary results from it, pointing to the relevance of the tool to help teachers with their tasks.	commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence);computer;digital media;internet;knowledge society;pattern language;relevance;usability testing;web application	Júnia Coutinho Anacleto Silva;Alessandro José Francisco Carlos;Aparecido Fabiano Pinatti de Carvalho;Ana Luiza Dias	2008		10.1145/1497470.1497487	educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;software framework;multimedia;active learning;pattern;world wide web;synchronous learning	HCI	-72.57180121766436	-38.28130844819747	187361

The approach is based on a synthesis of a constructivist learning theory and a creativity education theory. In contrast to previous approaches in which the systems analyst elicits requirements from the user, in the proposed approach, the user is engaged and stimulated to become a proactive and creative learner in the process of identifying and discovering their business problem as well as exploring opportunities to apply ICT innovations to solve the problem Two experiential digital simulations are described as a proof of concept to demonstrate the proposed approach a learning environment.

a035df0c81af3a442612373965fa87f74c807d64	towards a writing analytics framework for adult english language learners		Improving the written literacy of newcomers to English-speaking countries can lead to better education, employment, or social integration opportunities. However, this remains a challenge in traditional classrooms where providing frequent, timely, and personalized feedback is not always possible. Analytics can scaffold the writing development of English Language Learners (ELLs) by providing such feedback. To design these analytics, we conducted a field study analyzing essay samples from immigrant adult ELLs (a group often overlooked in writing analytics research) and identifying their epistemic beliefs and learning motivations. We identified common themes across individual learner differences and patterns of errors in the writing samples. The study revealed strong associations between epistemic writing beliefs and learning strategies. The results are used to develop guidelines for designing writing analytics for adult ELLs, and to propose ideas for analytics that scaffold writing development for this group.	field research;personalization;spatial variability	Amna Liaqat;Cosmin Munteanu	2018		10.1145/3170358.3170422	knowledge management;literacy;social integration;computer science;analytics;learning analytics;scaffold	HCI	-75.03558916435065	-39.78675493952164	190074

This relatively new area of research requires new methodological approaches of interaction and problem solving analysis. Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the center of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called “Object-oriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF)” is presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the center of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a reversed view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are ‘owned’ by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development. OCAF provides both qualitative and quantitative measures of collaboration. It is shown that this framework can be applied effectively both in synchronous computer supported collaborative environments of distance groups and in face-to-face collaborative activities.	problem solving	Nikolaos M.

dfba6f4ea2153476ce36add9d3871d5ddc8b58e1	tagclouds and group cognition: effect of tagging support on students' reflective learning in team blogs	student journals;prompting;information retrieval;hypermedia;data analysis;concept mapping;indexing;writing instruction;scaffolding teaching technique;collaborative writing;cooperative learning;electronic journals;reflection;writing composition;undergraduate students	We investigated the effects of supported tagging (a prompting mechanism for students to stop and think about their writing) for team blogging on undergraduate students’ reflective learning and the relationship between tagclouds and group cognition. Thirty-nine students were randomly assigned to six groups and blogged for 5 weeks. Three groups were randomly selected to receive instructor-provided keywords as supports for their tagging activity in the team blogs. Data analyses included: (1) comparing studentattached tags to the instructor-provided keywords and each participant’s concept map for evidence of reflection; and (2) comparing each team’s tagcloud against the team members’ aggregated concept maps for the corresponding relationship between tagclouds and group cognition. Results revealed that the instructor’s support in such situations might be helpful to keep students on task whereas free tagging may offer an opportunity for students’ deeper processing of learning. The results also showed that tagclouds well represented students’ group cognition. Introduction Reflective thinking refers to a learner’s purposeful and conscious manipulation of ideas toward meaningful learning. Blogs can promote reflective thinking as blogs, like journals, allow students to externalize their reasoning and reflections on experiences (Fiedler et al, 2004). Xie and Sharma (2013) found that keywords tagged freely to blogs were varyingly associated with the content of the blogs, indicating different levels of reflective thinking. Their study also revealed some random tagging as some keywords students attached were not related to the content of the blog. It is not clear whether an instructor’s support on such tagging activity could affect students’ tagging behavior or their reflective thinking process. One purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of supported tagging on students’ reflective learning in team blogs. The second purpose of the study was to explore how tagclouds represent team members’ group cognition, which could mean the intersecting parts of the group members’ knowledge network. Collaborative tagging or the generation of tagclouds is commonly viewed as a recent technological development for group cognition (Cress & Held, 2013). With the team blog tool used in this study, student-attached keywords generated tagclouds. Although tagclouds intuitively and graphically support the co-occurrence relations among tags, no research to date has established a rigorous, quantitative relationship between tagclouds and group cognition.

Recent developments in affective computing have provided more opportunities in the way online IL education can be delivered. However, research on how affective computing can be used in IL education is lacking. The research objectives of this study are therefore twofold: to investigate the influence of affective embodied agents (EAs) on students' motivation, enjoyment, knowledge retention and intention to use; and to uncover factors influencing their intention to use an online IL tutorial with affective EAs. To achieve these objectives, 285 university students were recruited to participate in a betweensubjects experiment (text-only, non-affective EAs, and affective EAs), including completing an IL tutorial and a post-test questionnaire. The results suggested that students benefited from the added use of an affective EA in the IL tutorials, in terms of learning motivation and enjoyment. Moreover, relevance, confidence, satisfaction, affective enjoyment, and behavioral enjoyment were found to be significant predictors for intention to use an IL tutorial with affective EAs.

Student course satisfaction is a multivariate nonlinear problem. Neural network (NN) techniques have been successfully applied to approximating nonlinear functions in many disciplines, but there has been little information available in applying NN to the modelling of student course satisfaction. In this paper, based on the student survey results collected from 43 courses in 11 semesters from 2002 to 2007, statistical analysis and NN techniques are incorporated for establishing some dynamic models for analysing and predicting student course satisfaction. The factors identified from this process also allow new strategies to be drawn for improving course satisfaction in the future. This study shows that both the number of students (NS) enrolled to a course and the high distinction (HD) rate in final grading are the two most influential factors to student course satisfaction. The three-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) models outperform the linear regressions in predicting student course satisfaction, with the best outcome being achieved by combining both NS and HD as the input to the networks.	artificial neural network	William W.

The aim of this paper is to show how SDG can be used to improve the way resources are used in schools, allowing students to work simultaneously on individual problems at a shared display, and achieve personalized learning with individual feedback within different cultural contexts. We used computational fluency to apply our concept of ‘One Mouse per Child’. It consists of a participatory approach that makes use of personal feedback on an interpersonal computer for the whole classroom. This allows for N simultaneous intelligent tutoring systems, where each child advances at his or her own pace, both within a lecture and throughout the curricular units. Each student must solve a series of mathematical exercises, generated according to his or her performance through a set of pedagogical rules incorporated into the system. In this process, the teacher has an active mediating role, intervening when students require attention. Two exploratory studies were performed. The first study was a multicultural experience between two such distanced socio-economic realities as Chile and India. It showed us that even in different environmental conditions, it is possible to implement this technology with minimal equipment (i.e. a computer, a projector, and one mouse per child). The second study was carried out in a third grade class in a low-income school in Santiago de Chile. The students were asked to solve mainly addition exercises. We established statistically relevant results and observed that the software proved most beneficial for the students with the lowest initial results. This happens because the system adapts to the students’ needs, reinforcing the content they most need to work on, thus generating a personalized learning process.	collaborative software;computer;input device;personalization;video projector	Cristian Alcoholado;Miguel Nussbaum;Arturo Tagle;Florencia Gómez;Fernanda Denardin;Heinz Susaeta;Marco Villalta;Kentaro Toyama	2012	J.

However, the specific learner characteristics that lead to performance in an elearning environment are unclear. This study investigated this problem in corporate e-learning environments from an academic self-regulated learning (SRL) perspective. A causal model was introduced, highlighting dimensions of self-regulation hypothesized to be predictors of perceived elearning performance, in terms of mastery, retention and job performance. The eight dimensions of academic self-regulation considered are intrinsic goal orientation, extrinsic goal orientation, selfefficacy for SRL, computer self-efficacy, e-learning self-efficacy, time management, environment management, and help seeking. Quantitative data was gathered using an online questionnaire which was administered to employees at four major organizations and a group of students undertaking a postgraduate Information Technology course at the University of New South Wales, who are also fulltime employees at various organizations. Statistical analyses performed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique demonstrated that e-learners with higher levels of intrinsic goal orientation, self-efficacy for SRL, e-learning self-efficacy, and environment management are likely to have better e-learning course performance. This study has both theoretical and practical implications for researchers, organizations and learners.	causal model;homeostasis;level of measurement;partial least squares regression	Sheryl Sharma;Geoffrey Dick;Wynne W.

Mobile devices enable individuals to learn anywhere and anytime, even if only little time is available. Usually, m-learning is often seen as e-learning on mobile devices. This disregards the real potential of m-learning. Instead, the characteristics of mobility should be taken into account when designing m-learning, namely different places of learning and the process of location change. In this paper, we therefore introduce the concept of location-sequence-based learning LSBL that explicitly considers these characteristics. Then, we combine LSBL with the concept of game based learning GBL in order to even enhance the motivational aspect of both concepts.

As part of a semester-long study strategies intervention for undergraduate biology students, we created 4 short instructional videos demonstrating the strategy of comparing-and-contrasting within diagrams (CC DIA) and delivered these just before the first course exam. We hypothesized that this strategy would help students develop a deeper comprehension of the instructed biology content. Participants were 128 undergraduates in a 2nd semester introductory (molecular and cellular) biology course, who participated in exchange for extra course credit. Students who accessed our videos scored a significant 5.5% points higher on the first exam of the semester, compared to students in other conditions or non-viewers (d = .35). Our brief (approx. 10 min per week × 4 weeks) instruction in using diagrams to learn biology yielded significant gains in undergraduate achievement.	diagram	Jennifer G.

Analysis of thirty partially distributed experimental groups that met over a series of four sessions was conducted by using two methods. Questionnaires were administered to ascertain perceptions of satisfaction and procedural practices. Content analysis was used to determine actual procedural behavioral patterns. Results indicate that members’ preferences for procedural order do appear to affect the patterns of their actual structuring behaviors, but do not affect their satisfaction with the group process.	behavioral pattern;procedural programming	Kelly Burke;Kregg Aytes	2001		10.1109/HICSS.2001.926212	simulation;teleconference;content analysis;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;management;group dynamics;collaborative software	HCI	-73.39521006164084	-43.082299214134046	192319

Although research has shown that AR systems have the potential to improve student learning, the educator community does not clearly understand the educational impact of AR, nor the factors which impact the educational effectiveness of AR. In this poster, we analyse 32 publications that have previously compared learning effects of AR vs non-AR applications. We identify a list of positive and negative impacts of AR on student learning, and identify potential underlying causes for these effects. Our vision is that educational initiatives will exploit these factors, in order to realize the full potential of AR to enrich learner's lives.	ar (unix);augmented reality	Iulian Radu	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)	10.1109/ISMAR.2012.6402590	augmented reality;simulation;media;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;solid modeling	Visualization	-73.81775818134497	-39.3904931343459	192675

Our empirical study examined how social workers in one NGO used an internal discussion forum to help them disseminate time-sensitive employment opportunities for people with mental impairments, provide space for collective expressions of support, and enable sharing of information and experiences. The main purpose of the paper is to study a multifaceted assessment methodology to assess online discussion forums in an NGO. In this paper, we carry out a systemic set of assessment methods including network analysis, category analysis, and content analysis for evaluating online social software, and particularly discussion forums. The methods are used empirically to assess patterns of information sharing, social network, and peer support in an NGO.	computer-mediated communication;experience;mechatronics;organizational behavior;page view;social network analysis;software performance testing;traffic analysis	Yao-Jen Chang;Yao-Sheng Chang	2011	Educational Technology & Society		the internet;social science;social work;interview;content analysis;network analysis;knowledge management;evaluation;organizational communication;management;social psychology;world wide web;educational assessment;social network	HCI	-73.42872638541395	-41.0993566734999	192872

Participants were an intact class of undergraduate students enrolled in a course blog. To expand students’ understanding of using thoughtful questions, the researcher used a systematic step-by-step process to teach SQ in a blended learning environment. The main purpose of face-to-face sessions was to prepare students to practice Socratic discussions on the blog. The study employs a mixed-method design to integrate qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Students’ questions in four Socratic discussions were collected and coded by using a content analysis approach. The Cornell Critical Thinking Test Level X (CCTT-X) was applied to assess students’ CT ability. The results indicate that practicing SQ in a blended learning environment was significantly effective in fostering students’ CT.

For realizing value co-creative education and learning environment, detection of learners' mental states during their learning activities plays very important role at this environment. In this context, it is an important task to implement an e-learning system that can automatically detect changes of learners' mental states by observing their behaviors in learning activities. In this study, we conducted an experiment to explore relationships between mental states and behaviors of a learner on our experimental tools designed along with an assumption of a learning environment with an e-learning system. We focused on mouse and face movement as the behaviors. The results of the experiment revealed some features about the behaviors and the mental states.	mental state	Tatsunori Matsui;Yuki Horiguchi;Kazuaki Kojima;Takako Akakura	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07863-2_8	psychology;error-driven learning;simulation;knowledge management;experiential learning;active learning;open learning;pedagogy	AI	-74.92090292887005	-43.87407754976221	193461

This study investigates two alternative teaching methods (collaborative learning and peer tutoring) and compares the learning results to the traditional learning context. A test was used to measure all participating students’ learning results and a questionnaire was distributed to record participant student attitudes towards the alternative teaching conditions. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate each aspect in terms of perceived knowledge, experience, satisfaction, diversity, oddness and interest. The analysis explores potential differences of students’ learning results between alternative and traditional teaching and also differences in the two aspects in relation to students’ preferences. Results provide evidence that active-learning methods can promote positive attitudinal shifts and improve skills in creativity, teamwork, collaboration and communication. Students perceived higher levels of learning than with traditional teaching. Finally in terms of students’ preferences, the majority wanted to have more courses taught with active-learning methods.	peer-to-peer;teaching method;theoretical computer science	Anastasios Theodoropoulos;Angeliki Antoniou;Giorgos Lepouras	2014	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-014-9327-7	psychology;qualitative comparative analysis;questionnaire;collaborative learning;information and communications technology;cooperative learning;computer science;teaching and learning center;teaching method;multimedia;active learning;peer assessment;peer tutor;pedagogy	HCI	-75.27950997265714	-41.09597648318718	193566
f5ff8d392c86f362099a4f2f32bc6b9129fd13b5	designing effective serious games for people with intellectual disabilities		Educating people with intellectual disabilities (ID) is a challenging process. Educators and researchers promote new methods in order to enhance the learning process and succeed in improving specific skills that people with intellectual disabilities have limitations. Serious games (SG) used in special education are considered as a successful tool for benefiting learning. In order to develop effective serious games, however, it is important to plan the design process properly. Therefore, design guidelines and principles should be thoroughly examined and accordingly selected. This paper aims to: (a) study existing serious games design frameworks; (b) extract design guidelines and principles from existing serious games for people with intellectual disabilities; (c) analyze the guidelines and principles, based on the elements of the design frameworks, which will then be used as the basis for a design framework dedicated to serious games for people with intellectual disabilities.	emoticon;suicidegirls	Stavros Tsikinas;Stelios Xinogalos	2018	2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363467	knowledge management;engineering;engineering design process;special education	HCI	-72.3236909700742	-39.03696682071453	193883

In previous research by the present author, digital immigrants from a baby-boomer cohort fare better than digital natives due to social reliance and meaningful posts. Meaningful posts include discussion comments that reflect meaning-based engagement with the course material. Students with optimal patterns and types of discussion participation do better than those students who just follow a point system of quantity-based engagement. Students were given three behavioral assessments and then monitored for meaningful posts and successful online behavior using the tracking features within Blackboard. Results were analyzed using a multiple regression and showed that a significant percentage of online learning is predicted by meaningful posts and homework performance while total online activity does not uniquely predict learning outcomes. Students with more meaningful posts show more engagement with the online materials and better learning than those with less meaningful posts.

The objective is to increase the interest and effectiveness of young students in learning this advanced technology and its applications. The factors of student age, gender and correlation with the performance in previous science courses were also investigated to see if they would affect the learning effectiveness. A teaching experiment was conducted and the results showed that the model was effective in helping students understand the basic concepts of synchrotron light source and its applications. Student age and gender had no obvious influence on the learning achievement, but a significant positive correlation was found between students' performance in their previous science courses and the learning achievement.

In the last decade, a large number of studies in CSCL have assessed how social interaction, learning processes and outcomes in virtual settings are intertwined. Although recent research findings indicate that learners differ with respect to the amount and type of discourse contributed in virtual settings, little is known about the causes of these differences. The research presented here looks into the effects of motivation of learners on their contribution to discourse. This study of 100 participants who were randomly distributed in six groups collaborated in a virtual setting to remediate deficiencies in economics indicates that individuals differed with respect to the amount of discourse activity. Furthermore, an integrated multi-method approach was used in order to examine the impact of academic motivation on the type of discourse activity contributed and on the position of the learner in the social network. The results indicate that highly intrinsically motivated learners become central and prominent contributors to cognitive discourse. In contrast, extrinsically motivated learners contribute on average and are positioned throughout the social network.	randomness;social network	Bart Rienties;Dirk T. Tempelaar;Piet Van den Bossche;W.

Six groups (n = 28) from an undergraduate online course were observed during a semester. Students' interactions were analyzed in two perspectives: group regulation and socioemotional. Cluster analysis was conducted to identify collaboration patterns of the groups. The analysis identified three collaborator clusters: one good and two poor. The good collaborators (named Early Active Collaborator) demonstrated: (1) intensive interactions among group members in the early collaboration phase, (2) positive socio-emotional interactions continuously, and (3) adaptive selections of group regulatory behaviors. The others showed dormant interactions throughout the projects and least socio-emotional interactions (named Passive Task-oriented Collaborator) and did not coordinate group process in a timely manner (named Late Collaborator). Comparisons of the interaction pattern and instructor intervention were discussed.	interaction	Kyungbin Kwon;Ying-Hsiu Liu;LaShaune P.

Our study consists of a sociolinguistics research resulting from a survey on linguistic behaviors difference between Japanese and Koreans. In our study, we compared our results with the ones derived from a sociolinguistics research conducted in Korean universities, in order to see if there is consistency between the two. Thanks to the results of our experiment, we found out that our experimental premise of “the difference in intercultural behavior influences learners” is correct.	experiment;internet linguistics	Sanggyu Shin;Hiroshi Hashimoto	2017	2017 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)	10.1109/SII.2017.8279308	engineering;premise;computer vision;artificial intelligence;cultural diversity;communication;cross-cultural;sociolinguistics;gesture	SE	-73.96960268015236	-43.212018654096354	194818

To counter this challenge, the Online Labs (OLabs) pedagogy is designed as a complete learning environment with tutorials, theory, procedure, animations, videos and simulations while the assessment includes conceptual, experimental, procedural and reporting skills. We discuss two separate empirical studies using OLabs to study the performance gains, student attitudes and preferences while using physical labs, desktops and tablets. The first study was at a school that compared students who learnt individually with OLabs on desktops, to students who learnt with the traditional teacher led physical labs. The second study was at a science camp and compared OLabs on desktops to OLabs that were context adapted for android tablets.

Many learners complete these courses successfully, or to their own satisfaction, but the high numbers who do not finish remain a subject of concern for platform providers and educators. In 2013, a team from Stanford University analysed engagement patterns on three MOOCs run on the Coursera platform. They found four distinct patterns of engagement that emerged from MOOCs based on videos and assessments. However, not all platforms take this approach to learning design. Courses on the FutureLearn platform are underpinned by a social-constructivist pedagogy, which includes discussion as an important element. In this paper, we analyse engagement patterns on four FutureLearn MOOCs and find that only two clusters identified previously apply in this case. Instead, we see seven distinct patterns of engagement: Samplers, Strong Starters, Returners, Mid-way Dropouts, Nearly There, Late Completers and Keen Completers. This suggests that patterns of engagement in these massive learning environments are influenced by decisions about pedagogy. We also make some observations about approaches to clustering in this context.	cluster analysis;futurelearn;massive open online course;social constructivism	Rebecca Ferguson;Doug Clow	2015		10.1145/2723576.2723606	simulation;engineering;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-75.75608363711127	-39.49820017004428	195285

The focus of the current meta-analysis is the use of technology to enable instructional conditions that promote collaborative interactions among learners. More specifically, it aims to compare the impact of designed interaction treatments (i.e., collaborative activities intentionally built into course design) and contextual interaction treatments (i.e., course conditions that result in high levels of student-student interaction but are not intentionally designed to promote collaboration) on student learning outcomes. Results indicate that designed treatments outperform contextual treatments ( g ? ?=?0.52, k?=?25 vs. g ? ?=?0.11, k?=?20, QBetween?=?7.91, p?<?.02) on measures of achievement, emphasizing the importance of planning and instructional design in technology integration in postsecondary education.

In online open and distant learning, group work is a commonly used strategy, given its collaborative nature and constructivist framework (Bates & Poole, 2003; Garrison & Anderson, 2003; Jonassen, 2005). In this context, collaborative learning processes are highly dependent on the shared written information and the interactions that are established among the participants. The types of interactions that occur within such groups are often decisive for its success. The present research was developed in the context of a Curricular Unit that is part of the degree plans for the Master in E-learning Pedagogies and the Master in Educational and Multimedia Communication at the Universidade Aberta, where a new pedagogical model for online education has been implemented since 2007. Two main research questions were asked: What are the interaction patterns that characterize successful groups? What types of constraints prevent some participants from fully engagement on the group work? To answer these questions, after the course was finished, two particular groups were identified (one characterized has very successful in their final product and one has less successful), after that, each of the group ́s online discussion forums was coded and submitted to content analysis. Data analysis involved iterative analysis and revision of the coding scheme (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). Two of the researchers derived the initial coding key from the online discussion forums used during the group project phase of the Curricular Unit. Some of the codes were quantified in order to foster a more meaningful comparison of the data by allowing patterns to be identified and further explored (McConnell, 2006). This type of assessment was welcomed by the students and effectively implemented by all the groups but one. Nevertheless, the interpretation made by each group of what should be valued and how it should be operationalized varied significantly. Even though the groups seemed to follow similar stages throughout their project development, distinct interaction patterns emerged between more and less successful groups. This raised issues of equity and validity of the suggested method, as well as about the best strategies to foster productive online collaborative learning environments in general, and about the role of the instructor in particular.	code;interaction;iterative method;problem solving	Irene Oliveira;L.

2c97b134a1ab824b9a82bf885bfa4e9ec27eb398	time development of early social networks: link analysis and group dynamics		Empirical data on early network history are rare. Students beginning their studies at a university with no or few prior connections to each other offer a unique opportunity to investigate the formation and early development of social networks. During a nine week introductory physics course, first year physics students were asked to identify those with whom they communicated about problem solving in physics during the preceding week. We use these students’ self reports to produce time dependent student interaction networks. These networks have also been investigated to elucidate possible effects of gender and students’ final course grade. Changes in the weekly number of links are investigated to show that while roughly half of all links change from week to week, students also reestablish a growing number of links as they progress through their first weeks of study. To investigate how students group, Infomap is used to establish groups. Further, student group flow is examined using alluvial diagrams, showing that many students jump between group each week., Finally, a segregation measure is developed which shows that students structure themselves according to gender and laboratory exercise groups and not according to end-of-course grade. The results show the behavior of an early social-educational network, and may have implications for theoretical network models as well as for physics education.	diagram;interaction network;link analysis;problem solving;social network	Jesper Bruun;Ian G.

We introduce ViMAP-Tangible, a socio-technically distributed computational learning environment, which integrates ultrasonic sensors with the ViMAP visual programming language using a distributed computation infrastructure. In this paper, we report a study in which 3 and 4 grade students used ViMAP-Tangible to engage in collaborative design-based activities in order to invent “drawing machines” for generating geometric shapes. The curricular activities integrate engineering practices such as user-centered design, mathematical reasoning about multiplication, rates and fractions, and physical science concepts central to learning Newtonian mechanics. We identify the key affordances of the learning environment and our pedagogical approach in terms of the relationship between the structural elements of students’ physical constructions and computational models, and their learning outcomes, both in terms of computational thinking, and the domain-specific, mathematical and scientific knowledge that they began developing.	agent-based model;computation;computational model;computational thinking;distributed computing;engineering design process;ibm notes;interdependence;iterative and incremental development;iterative method;refinement (computing);reflection (computer programming);sensor;sociotechnical system;synergy;user-centered design;visual programming language	Pratim Sengupta;Gokul Krishnan;Mason Wright	2014		10.5220/0004949500670078	mathematics education;user-centered design;engineering education;computer science;mathematics;visual programming language	AI	-71.3037039804554	-40.89054916528876	196759

With this researchin-progress, we therefore propose a conceptual framework for a blended learning flipped classroom to redesign large-scale IS lectures, recognize the important role of peers in the student journey, and improve interaction. We therefore derive requirements from the theory of interaction for flipped classrooms. These requirements are addressed by design principles for flipped classrooms and implemented in a large-scale IS lecture. With the implementation, we are able to overcome large-scale lecture related limitations, and, as a practical contribution, help IS lecturers to face the according challenges. As a theoretical contribution, we enrich the body of large-scale learningteaching-environments by considering explicitly the role of peers. The study is currently running in order to evaluate the concept.	requirement	Sarah Oeste;Katja Lehmann;Andreas Janson;Jan Marco Leimeister	2014			collaborative learning;interaction;simulation;computer science;multimedia;peer assessment;information management	HCI	-74.57834372005959	-38.27083972727203	197017

In an experiment on the effect of network visualizations, remote pairs worked synchronously to identify a serial killer. They discussed disparate evidence distributed across the pair using IM. Four conditions, respectively, offered (a) spreadsheet only (controls), (b) individual unshared visualizations, (c) view-only shared visualizations, and (d) a full-access shared visualization of all evidence. We examined collaborative performance, use of the visualization tool, and communication as a function of condition. All visualization conditions improved remote collaborators' performance over the control condition. Full access to a shared visualization best facilitated remote collaboration by encouraging tool use and fostering discussion between the partners. Shared visualization without full access impaired performance somewhat and made communication even more vital to identifying the serial killer. This study provides direct evidence of visualization tool features and partner behavior that promote collaboration.	emoticon;instant messaging;music visualization;problem solving;spreadsheet	Aruna D.

This paper illustrates the development of a research model based on AST, and reports the results of a study conducted on the basis of this model. The independent variables in the study were task and technology. The model’s process component was represented by the attitudes of group members toward the technology they used. The six attitude dimensions were obtained from AST as well as from other information technology researchers. The model was tested using the partial least squares (PLS) technique.

A questionnaire was administered to 76 students enrolled in online course sections and 72 students enrolled in face-to-face course sections. The questionnaire examined student capabilities in four areas associatedwith success in distance education. These are: basic communication skills and access to the Internet, motivational styles, preferences for individual vs. group work, time management issues, and attitudes toward online education. Online students were more comfortable than face-to-face students communicating electronically, had better access to the Internet, and reported better typing skills. Face-to-face students reported themselves to be more reliant on class participation to stimulate their interest in a class, and were more favorably disposed to group exercises. Online students were very much more likely than face-to-face students within the same institution and degree program to believe that online education was of comparable quality to face-to-face education.	information science;internet;list of information schools;profiling (computer programming)	Maria Haigh	2007	Education for Information		science education;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-76.39521289073612	-41.439057997828264	197620

The study included thirty students who attend 11th grade in a high school in Trabzon, Turkey. Firstly, preliminary data about Facebook usage of students were obtained to understand the factors that motivate students to use Facebook and whether they use them for the educational purpose or not. Then, a Facebook group was created, in which a literature teacher was assigned as the guide of the group. This study lasted twelve weeks. The students’ assignments such as compositions, poems, and vignettes, discussions, the teacher’s views and observation, data from the interviews with participants were analyzed in this study. Results from this study indicated that that Facebook group was effective on issues such as development of writing abilities of students, communication and cooperation between teacher and students, and cooperation and communication among students. The original idea for this research was to determine that proper usage of language can be improved in social context if Facebook group is created as a flexible online community with interactive and reflective activities, effective tool of sharing and communication. This study demonstrates how Facebook can successfully be used in educational environment appropriately.	norm (social);online community	Hasan Karal;Mehmet Kokoç;Ozlem Cakir	2015	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-015-9428-y	psychology;multimedia;social psychology;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-74.69682815502797	-39.948495187292465	198866

This will allow us to propose conceptual and technical tools to facilitate and support the design process adopted by the designers	analog expansion bus	Hassina El-Kechaï;Christophe Choquet	2006	Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT'06)	10.1109/ICALT.2006.338	project management;process design;design process;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;database;multimedia;electronic publishing;management;world wide web	EDA	-71.90542403200453	-38.14863758063513	199085
