Each presenter will conclude with a discussion of areas of weakness/neglect in these resources, and recommendations for improvement. These resources are: (1) the archives of ASIST; (2) the foundational and developmental histories of ASIST Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Chapters; (3) the photographic/visual record of ASIST; (4) the oral history record of ASIST and information science leaders. This progression will facilitate the panelists' discussion of opportunities for engaging with ASIST resources at the national, regional, and individual levels. Each panel member has extensive experience in working with the resources discussed and was a member of the 75 Anniversary Task Force.	archive;color gradient;information science	Kathryn La Barre;Sarah A.

As PFBR, Material Science (MS) research of JAERI is chosen. The appropriateness of the present bibliometric method is discussed. The authors believe that this method is applicable to studying the socio-economic effect on PFBR. The shortcoming of it is, however, the use of the inevitable usage of biased EBRF (ranked keywords), accompanied with the feeling of unfairness. The authors confirm that the S-matrix has a potential capability to show the quantitative magnitude of co-operation among research institutions avoiding significant bias.	bibliometrics;international nuclear information system;microsoft windows;norm (social);ps (unix);roland gs;scientometrics	Kazuaki Yanagisawa;Shoji Takahashi	2008	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-008-1636-4	social science;operations research	Robotics	-75.61187340140775	-21.663935932935026	158782

Uncertainty is understood as an important component of the information seeking process, but it has not been explored as a component of reference and information service. Method. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to examine the practitioner perspective of reference and information service for eight academic research librarians in the United States. Analysis. Data were analyzed thematically according to interpretative phenomenological analysis procedures. Results. Variety and uncertaintyemerged as one of the themes of experience for these practitioners. Based on the results of this study, a conceptual model is proposed for uncertainty in reference and information service. Conclusion. The conceptual model of uncertainty in reference and information service can be used for further study of the phenomenon and to contribute to a comparative sociology of uncertainty across professions. In addition, it can be used to support practitioners and to better prepare students for the uncertainties of practice.	information seeking;librarian	Amy VanScoy	2015	Inf.

Author profiles can be very useful for evaluation purposes once the advantages and the shortcomings of these services are described and taken into consideration. A total of 771 personal profiles appearing in both the MAS and the GSC databases are analysed. Results show that the GSC profiles include more documents and citations than those in MAS, but with a strong bias towards the Information and Computing sciences, while the MAS profiles are disciplinarily better balanced. MAS shows technical problems such as a higher number of duplicated profiles and a lower updating rate than GSC. It is concluded that both services could be used for evaluation proposes only if they are applied along with other citation indexes as a way to supplement that information.	citation index;database;gsc bus;google scholar;list of academic databases and search engines;microsoft academic search;qualitative comparative analysis;web search engine	José Luis Ortega;Isidro F.

The major challenge of finding a cost‐effective alternative to its statewide network, which was terminated by a 1993 legislative mandate, has led to opportunities to provide better services and resources by switching public libraries to point‐to‐point accounts and by migrating the state library’s information resources to an Internet‐accessible workstation.	internet access;library (computing)	Robert Burgin	1996	Internet Research	10.1108/10662249610152258	public relations;the internet;cost-effectiveness analysis;internet access;telecommunications;point-to-point;computer science;sociology;law;world wide web;information system	Metrics	-70.13929171956623	-18.571587571163903	160967

It also represents the culmination of the education of students, in which they are asked to present an original research project and demonstrate their research skills to a thesis defence committee composed of university lecturers, academics and specialists. PhD theses are therefore a good reflection of the predominant lines of work and research at universities and other academic institutions. Furthermore, as PhD candidates must have a supervisor and obtain the approval of the academic community represented by the thesis defence committee, PhD theses are a good source of information on the social structure of research (López Yepes 2002; Delgado et al. 2006). This aspect is especially interesting in some areas of the social sciences and in the humanities which, unlike the experimental sciences, involve practically no collaborative work (Hagstrom 1965; Bourke 1997; Molteni and Zulueta 2002; Ardanuy 2008).	bibliometrics;experiment;information source;social network analysis;social structure;word lists by frequency	Jordi Ardanuy;Cristóbal Urbano;Lluís Quintana	2009	Inf.

Examination of 418 articles in eight economics journals found that, after controlling for article length, journal and author quality, lead article position, and coauthorship, an author's prior stock of self-citations is not statistically related to a subsequent article's total citation count or the quality of the journals in which those citations appear. Self-citations that appear in prestigious high-impact economics journals have a statistically positive, but numerically small, effect on a subsequent article's total citation count and on the quality of the citing journal. The productive effect of a prior self-citation is inversely related to its age. Prior self-citations of the second author listed in a collaborative article have no significant effect on a subsequent article's total citation count or the quality of the economics journals in which those citations appear.	journal citation reports;numerical analysis	Marshall H.

Citation analysis is used to trace the diffusion of ideas as they are embodied in monographic publications. The study is part of a developing research programme and is intended to establish a framework to inform future developments. Four specific hypotheses are developed and tested. They are concerned with: the relative impact of monographs and journal articles produced within a discipline; the distinction between core and non‐core group monographs; the correlation between the reception and intellectual survival of a monograph; and the comparative level of impact of monographic and journal article publication by a single author. It is concluded that the presence of core or elite groups can be perceived in all aspects of the study.

The written texts mostly are found in archives, the printed ones mostly in libraries. As to the nature of the sources in archives, there are many varieties: texts of laws, debates, population registration, accountancy records etc. Social historians, concerned as they are with larger social patterns and with the everyday life of ordinary people, may wish to be able to trace individuals in a particular region or society during a particular historical period. To do this they have to rely on all kinds of sources of personal and family information such as parish rolls, assessment rolls, birth-, marriage-, and death-records, cluband schoolrecords, records of doctors and lawyers, columns of newspapers, municipal registers, etc. All these routinely generated records have to be linked over long periods of time in order to obtain numerical data on social mobility, persistence, turnover, residential 'half-life' and the like. The interest in the linkage of several records concerning one individual has considerably grown. Nowadays we find commercial obtainable packages for Data Base Management (DBM) Systems. With those packages standard operations for record linkage as well as for obtaining tabulations ready for statistical packages like SPSS are available. On the other hand, considerable progress has been made in the field of computational linguistics and text processing. In our opinion experiments should be started now to bridge the gap between the data base management systems and the raw data contained in the registers for	linkage (software);preprocessor	M. Boot;P.

According to the traditional view, adopted and fostered by many textbooks of genetics, Mendel’s principles were presented in the first half of 1900 simultaneously and independently by three biologists (H. de Vries, C. Correns, E. v. Tschermak-Seysenegg). Having thus laid the foundations of further development, the ‘rediscovery’ continues to attract considerable interest. Since the 1950s, however, serious questions arose concerning both the chronology and specific conceptual achievement of the scientists involved. Not only the independence but also parallelism was analysed in the context of individual research programmes of these three scholars. The youngest of them, Erich v. Tschermak-Seysenegg, was even excluded from the list of ‘rediscoverers’. The aim of this paper is to use new archival evidence and approximate the contribution of the physiologist and ophthalmologist Armin von Tschermak-Seysenegg (1870–1952) to the events of 1900 and 1901.	anatomic structures;approximation algorithm;archive;assumed;chronology as topic;entity name part qualifier - adopted;exclusion;experiment;foundations;jart armin;paper;parallel computing;small;tension;textbooks;benefit;explanation;predorsal bundle	Michal Simunek;Michael Mielewczik;Georgy S.

This would fit well with the public libraries' mission: to facilitate access to information and resources in a variety of media and should therefore place them at the forefront of assisting people with the disability of dyslexia. A PhD research project: Public library provision of resources for dyslexic individuals'; was undertaken at the Department of Information Science, Loughborough University, from December 1992 to 2000. The main focus of the investigation was primary research to establish what libraries are doing to ensure effective resource provision for dyslexic individuals. An extensive literature review is followed by the results of a questionnaire survey of 114 library authorities in England and Wales (75 per cent response rate) to determine the extent to which public libraries are providing for dyslexic users. Although the very high response rate indicated considerable interest in the subject of dyslexia resource provision, the survey data revealed that the level of activity in support of people with dyslexia was very modest, with only 16.7 per cent of the authorities claiming to have policy statements on special needs in general and even fewer (7 per cent) claiming that their policies directly covered dyslexia. A study of the policy documents revealed that many of the policies only covered dyslexia by inference and in no case was dyslexia specifically mentioned. Reluctance to use the term was almost universal amongst library authorities and, with a few notable exceptions, little was being done to address the needs of dyslexic users. The study concluded that: public libraries are not organizing and promoting resources for dyslexic individuals in a way that helps them to overcome the obstacles limiting library use; information about dyslexia is commonly held in public libraries, but few library authorities are doing much to address specifically the wider resource needs of dyslexic individuals; some library authorities are doing more than others; and the library profession and major bodies dealing with dyslexia are not providing proactive leadership in the area of resource provision for people with dyslexia. Some of the ways in which public libraries can work to remedy this situation are presented.	library (computing);public library	Hazel Rutledge	2002	JOLIS	10.1177/096100060203400302	psychology;library science;dyslexia;social science;multimedia;sociology;management;law;world wide web	EDA	-72.29916251005143	-22.145035347633	163904

Many new projects, partnerships and commercial agreements have been announced to build citation linking applications. This paper describes the Open Citation (OpCit) project, which will focus on linking papers held in freely accessible eprint archives such as the Los Alamos physics archives and other distributed archives, and which will build on the work of the Open Archives initiative to make the data held in such archives available to compliant services. The paper emphasises the work of the project in the context of emerging digital library information environments, explores how a range of new linking tools might be combined and identifies ways in which different linking applications might converge. Some early results of linked pages from the OpCit project are reported.	archive;converge;digital library;library (computing)	Steve Hitchcock;Les Carr;Zhuoan Jiao;Donna Bergmark;Wendy Hall;Carl Lagoze;Stevan Harnad	2000		10.1145/336597.336655	library science;computer science;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-71.09947976959623	-22.170019742827613	163943

This study compares Science’s bibliometric characteristics between three periods: a pre-Koshland (1975–1984) period, the Koshland period (1985–1995) and the post-Koshland period (1996–2006). The distributions of document types, the country/territory and institutional distribution of authors, co-authorship data and disciplinary impact measured by subject categories of citations are studied.

Surprising results were that a number of scholars anticipated—and found—that they were already familiar with a very high percentage of the records their searches retrieved. Previous familiarity with documents has been mentioned in discussion of relevance and information retrieval (IR) theory, but it has generally not been considered a significant factor. However, these experiences indicate that high document familiarity can be a significant factor in searching. Some implications are drawn regarding the impact of high document familiarity on relevance and IR theory. Finally, some speculations are made regarding high document familiarity and Bradford's Law.	bradford's law;getty thesaurus of geographic names;relevance	Marcia J. Bates	1996	Inf. Process.

Although research on convergence has recently grown, there is little research which reviews the studies of convergence in the past and present, and critically discusses the development of convergence research. To fill this gap, this paper examines the current status of convergence research by use of a library meta-search engine. The analysis of the articles retrieved offers a series of snapshots regarding present studies on digital convergence in terms of the type of convergence dealt with, the level of analysis, and so on. The analysis also shows that most research by now is theoretically oriented at the macro level (i.e. regulatory and industrial), and suggests that more empirical research from the micro perspective (i.e. firms and users) is required.	convergence;cuecat;web search engine	Seongcheol Kim;Heejin Lee;Myeong Ho Lee	2010	Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology		project commissioning;social science;computer science;engineering;data science;data mining;database;publishing;advertising;management;law;research	ML	-76.40270144954792	-17.202677524409996	166301

The analysis focuses on structural and strategic elements of information exchange between intellectual domains. Interview data reveal that scientists undertake individual and cooperative boundary-crossing research. Four research modes are identified and associated with different approaches to seeking information and knowledge base development. Probing for information, consultation, and learning are among the scientists’ central interdisciplinary research practices. In spite of these work strategies, research progress is complicated by the tension between researchers’ efforts to maintain a broad perspective and a high level of productivity. Information initiatives can provide “leeway” to help researchers shift their efforts away from their core specialization to the peripheral domains that infuse their interdisciplinary work.	comefrom;centralisation;entity–relationship model;high-level programming language;information exchange;information literacy;information retrieval;information science;information system;jargon;knowledge base;library (computing);partial template specialization;peripheral	Carole L.

The data for the study were obtained from the Medline database. The aim is to determine the volume of scientific output in the above period, the countries involved and the trends in the subject matters addressed. Significant growth is observed in scientific production since 1991 and particularly in the period 1996-2001. The countries found to have the highest output are the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France and Germany. The collaboration networks established by scientists are also analysed in this study, as well as the evolution in the subject matters addressed in the papers they published, that are observed to remain essentially constant in the three sub-periods into which the study is divided.	bibliometrics	Elías Sanz-Casado;Carlos Suárez-Balseiro;Isabel Iribarren-Maestro;M.

We define the concentration place relative to a certain permutation σ of the set {1,…., N }. We show that the concept is good in different ways. We then give a theory of concentration evolution resulting in a nontrivial problem in operations research. We calculate levels of evolutions as well as directions of evolutions. Once they are calculated, these data give valuable information on how interests in certain topics can change along the years. Comparisons between the evolution of a journal and the evolution of the whole subject can be made as well as comparisons between the evolution of two journals. Also, the velocity of evolution can be measured with this theory.  An explicit examination is done for the  Transactions of the American Mathematical Society , in comparison with mathematics as a whole.	information retrieval	Leo Egghe	1988	Inf. Process.

The aim of this study is to share the experiences of the HAM-TMC Library, one of the largest US medical libraries, in creating and implementing such a tool. Design/methodology/approach – A narrative of the process demonstrates the genesis of the project and highlights the importance of collaboration with entities outside the usual library sphere. Findings – Results show that libraries have choices to make in designing their own futures and in offering innovative services to their users. Taking a proactive approach can yield exciting results. Originality/value – Many libraries accept federated search and other technologies directly from their library management system vendors as the simplest way to proceed with implementing new technologies. The HAM-TMC Library recognized that its particular information environment required learning the “problem space” thoroughly before investigating available options. As a result, the new tool the Library is providing is much more likely to meet specific user information needs.	entity;federated search;futures and promises;genesis;information needs;library (computing);proactive parallel suite;problem domain;traffic message channel;web 2.0	Dean James;Michael Garrett;Leah Krevit	2009	Library Hi Tech	10.1108/07378830910968218	simulation;computer science;management information systems;world wide web;search engine	HPC	-72.33938860922123	-23.822863140176526	168814
51844ad19a3b681fa40a92d3f62f6f472276613b	introduction to the special issue: data-driven approaches to research and teaching in professional and technical communication		The quest to understand the nuances of professional communication using computational tools have continued since, and many researchers in our field have embraced the new interdisciplinary approach now known as data science. Our quick metadata search on the journals and conference proceedings in technical and professional communication (TPC) revealed an increasing number of articles associated with terms commonly used in data science (e.g., big data, content analysis, text mining, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, network analysis) originating from numerous disciplines (e.g., corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, statistics, business analytics). Yet, the field of TPC is just beginning to embrace the power of data-driven approaches. This special issue extends Orr’s work by taking a snapshot of current work in data-driven approaches to the study of TPC.		Ryan K. Boettger;Suguru Ishizaki	2018	IEEE Trans.

beb9928a3cf343fa3023e24bf8086e3a3c5aeb05	the literature of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids): continuing changes in publication patterns and subject access	databases;comparative analysis	The literature on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) offers unique opportunities for bibliographic analysis. This study presents and analyzes data from the 1992 AIDSLINE database. The analysis compares these 1992 data with data from the 1989 AIDSLINE on two dimensions: The shifts in productivity of various journals that contributed to the literature; and the changing frequencies with which various Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used to provide subject access and control. The greatest increase in productivity came from the group of specialty journals in immunity, viral disease, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This increase has significance for collection management. Secondly, although a stable set of indexing terms persisted, new and newly prominent subject headings reflected changes in the knowledge base (e.g., the addition of the subsets of HIV) and the direction of research effort (e.g., toward transmission in the general population). The changes indicate that the knowledge base is less chaotic, but that it is still continuing its rapid alteration and development. The findings have implications for database searching, including the choice of database.	chaos theory;database;knowledge base	Esther Green Bierbaum;Terrence A.

7cde4a1f960895d7eac0998ee53b12d9d0fa281e	establishing a research culture for archive administration in the uk	preservation;information management	This paper is concerned with the current state of academic research within the discipline of archive administration in the UK. It identifies and examines a number of reasons why research output from the UK is so low when compared with activity on an international basis. These reasons include the historic nature of archival education in the UK, the expectations of training on the part of practitioners, perceptions of the value of research and archival theory within the UK profession, and the size and capacity of the archival academic community. This is contrasted with much greater activity and debate around the issue of research in Canada, the USA and Australia. The article makes a number of suggestions for fostering greater research activity in the UK such as a mapping of the research landscape to identify need, the development of a research agenda, and the introduction of modules in research training into postgraduate courses. The profile of current research activity could be raised by, for example, the publication of abstracts of masters’ dissertations. Work carried out by organisations like the National Archives into areas such as digital preservation could also be recognised as research.	archive	Mary Ellis	2005	Education for Information		information management;national archives;engineering management;political science;digital preservation;library science	NLP	-72.00244186951797	-19.530067667081557	170523

The data for comparative analysis were taken from Scientometric Datafiles.1Since raw counts of publications and citations are confounded by the size of the countries and the size of subject fields, cross-national comparison is made, using relative indicators—activity index and attractivity index. The subfields of relative strength and weakness for these countries are identified from the values of these indicators. The similarity structure of specialization profiles of the eleven countries is mapped, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. This mapping leads to the representation of chemistry as it is structured by the dynamics of national science policies of these countries.	cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering;image scaling;multidimensional scaling;partial template specialization;qualitative comparative analysis;scientometrics;viz: the computer game	P.

The literature output on information literacy was examined using the techniques of bibliometric analysis and information visualization. The literature considered was that constituted by the articles included in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), Scopus (Elsevier), Library and Information Science Abstracts, and Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts databases. The occurrence of descriptors was analysed using VOSViewer, a program that groups them into clusters and generates a map of their connections. The results showed exponential growth of some 30 % annually between 2005 and 2011, with a mean of 14.45 documents per year. Spain, with 119 documents, was the top producing country, followed by Brazil with 76. The distribution of the more than 500 authors fitted a Lotka-law pattern, and the distribution of the 105 journals fitted the three zones of a Bradford-law pattern. The visualization map showed the 62 descriptors to group into seven clusters. For its centrality, there stood out “Information literacy”, strongly related with “Information Science”. At the edge of the map were “Digital literacy” and “School library”, indicative of their lack of any strong relationship with other terms. The “Education”, “Knowledge management”, “Universities & colleges”, and “University libraries” descriptors were linked closely with the main IL theme.	bibliometrics;bradford's law;centrality;database;experience;information literacy;information visualization;knowledge management;library (computing);library and information science abstracts;lotka's law;public library;scientific literature;scopus;time complexity;web of science;world wide web	Maria Pinto;Maria Isabel Escalona;Antonio Pulgarín;Alejandro Uribe Tirado	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1498-x	mathematics education;social science;computer science;data science;information literacy;data mining;world wide web	HPC	-76.59192456192527	-21.26672602839307	170737
de599beb190ac7b41cdeb5ad96d8883f30e8a0c6	software citation in theory and practice		In most fields, computational models and data analysis have become a significant part of how research is performed, in addition to the more traditional theory and experiment. Mathematics is no exception to this trend. While the system of publication and credit for theory and experiment (journals and books, often monographs) has developed and has become an expected part of the culture, how research is shared and how candidates for hiring, promotion are evaluated, software (and data) do not have the same history. A group working as part of the FORCE11 community developed a set of principles for software citation that fit software into the journal citation system, allow software to be published and then cited, and there are now over 50,000 DOIs that have been issued for software. However, some challenges remain, including: promoting the idea of software citation to developers and users; collaborating with publishers to ensure that systems collect and retain required metadata; ensuring that the rest of the scholarly infrastructure, particularly indexing sites, include software; working with communities so that software efforts count; and understanding how best to cite software that has not been published.	book;computational model	Daniel S.

Using Chinese patent data in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), this paper examines the geographic variations in intraregional, inter-regional and international knowledge exchanges of China from 1985 to 2007. Degree centrality reveals that intraregional and international collaborations are the main channels of knowledge exchange for the provinces and municipalities of China while inter-regional knowledge exchange is relatively weak. Besides, over the two decades, the knowledge exchange network has been expanding (connecting an increasing number of provinces and countries), becoming more decentralized (increasing number of hubs) and more cohesive (more linkages). A blockmodel analysis further reveals that the inter-regional network of China begins to show characteristics of a core-periphery structure. The most active knowledge exchange occurs between members of the core block composed by the most advanced provinces while the members of the peripheral block from less favored regions have few or no local and extra-local knowledge exchange. Building a strong knowledge transfer network would much improve the innovation capacities in less favored regions and help them break out from their “locked-in” development trajectories.	centrality;core-periphery structure;ethernet hub;peripheral	Xia Gao;Jiancheng Guan;Ronald Rousseau	2011	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-011-0404-z	network analysis;computer science;information mapping;chine;operations research;china	AI	-74.81778094706988	-21.582682961873335	171531

The theory of normative behavior and its concepts of worldviews, social norms, social types, and information behavior are used to characterize the relationship between the small worlds of the two groups with the intent of understanding the gap between early classification research and information retrieval (IR) research.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThis is a mixed method analysis of two groups as evidenced in published artifacts by and about their work. A thorough review of historical literature about the groups as well as their own published works was employed and an author co-citation analysis was used to characterize the conceptual similarities and differences of the two groups of researchers.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe CRG focused on fundamental principles to aid classification and retrieval of information. The CDCR were more inclined to develop practical methods of retrieval without benefit of good theoretical foundations. The CRG began it work under the contention that the general classification schemes at the time were inadequate for the developing IR mechanisms.

The purpose of this article is to apply this new method to other fields to support its general applicability. We show that the method yields the same results for modern physicists, biologists, psychologists, inventors, and composers. That is, each individual's production is constant over time, and the time-period fluctuations follow the Poisson distribution. However, the productivity (e.g., papers per year) varies widely across individuals. We show that the distribution of productivity does not follow the normal (i.e., bell curve) distribution, but rather follows the exponential distribution. Thus, most authors produce at the lowest rate and very few authors produce at the higher rates. We also show that the career duration of individuals follows the exponential distribution. Thus, most authors have a very short career and very few have a long career. The principal advantage of the new method is that the detail structure of author productivity can be examined, such as trends, etc. Another advantage is that information science studies have guidance for the length of time interval being examined and estimating when an author's entire body of work has been recorded.

Libraries of many types have a duty to identify and maintain contact with constituents having a variety of health information needs. Assessing community needs includes identifying specific population groups, the languages that they speak, the health issues affecting their lives, and their preferred methods of obtaining information. Locating, acquiring, and disseminating materials that address relevant health issues in an accessible manner takes commitment, funding, and a variety of collection development techniques. Library efforts have improved access to health information for diverse communities, but significant barriers to accessing health information remain. Reaching communities effectively includes community outreach via programming and partnering with communitybased organizations and local health care agencies. By assisting information creators and health care providers in understanding how materials are being used and what materials need to be developed, library staff can play an important role in promoting the development of culturally and linguistically appropriate health information. Libraries worldwide are dedicated to meeting the information needs of the populations they serve. Meeting the health information needs of diverse populations is challenging for many reasons. Individual health information is intrinsically intimate and personal, time frames may be short, and there Kristine M. Alpi, Library Manager, Public Health Library, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 455 First Ave., Rm. 1233, New York, NY 10016; and Barbara M. Bibel, Reference Librarian, Science/Business/Social Science/Government Documents, Oakland Public Library, 125 14th Street, Oakland, CA 94612–4310 269 alpi and bibel/meeting health information needs may be many different “answers” to the question being expressed. Libraries of many types have a duty to identify and maintain contact with constituents having a variety of health information needs. Once information needs that impact the community’s health are identified, relevant information can be located and made available. Library efforts have improved access to health information for diverse communities, but significant barriers to accessing health information still need to be addressed. Library staff can play an important role in assisting information creators and health care providers to understand how materials are being used and what materials need to be developed. Identifying and Defining Communities Public and academic institutions define and reach out to their communities in many ways. Depending on the situation, the library may or may not already be viewed as part of the user community’s resources. What does it take to demonstrate a commitment to serving diverse populations? Is there a palette of collections and services that must be offered, or is it in the eye of the beholder that the community decides whether the library is committed to fulfilling its needs? In order to identify the communities, they first need to be defined. It is interesting to compare the institutional definition with how the community defines itself. There are many characteristics according to which a community can be defined: • Language • Geography • Race • Ethnicity • Age • Sexual orientation • Faith • Other characteristic(s) Language information can be gathered in a variety of ways. First, note the languages that library patrons and neighborhood residents speak. Are people or organizations asking for books or other materials in specific languages? Which language do people list as their primary language on their library card application? If the library does not track this information, there are other ways to learn about the population. Look at the census data for the city or county. Go to www.census.gov and use the American Fact Finder to get maps and statistics. Information concerning the language spoken at home, ability to speak English, and nativity and citizenship for residents is available in tables. Data from local school districts about the number of students with limited English and their primary languages may also be available via local or state Web sites. A m er ic an F ac t F in de r pr ov id es e as y ac ce ss to c en su s po pu la ti on d at a. 271 alpi and bibel/meeting health information needs Geographic characteristics can be fairly broad or very narrow. Areas circumscribed by political boundaries such as counties, congressional districts, and census tracts are easier to define but may not be meaningful to residents. In New York City, for example, much of the data is presented by United Hospital Fund zip code aggregations. These do not necessarily correspond to neighborhoods as defined by those who live there. As many health disparities are described as taking place in socioeconomic clusters, the type of housing in which people live also creates a community. The health concerns of those living in a housing project are different than those living in a single-family brownstone in the same zip code. The information needs of the homeless also need to be addressed. Health status by race has been described intensively in the literature on health disparities. Many large data sources collect data by race but not by ethnicity, country of origin, or language spoken. As a result, racial categories are used as a proxy for other things. The multiracial nature of many communities also makes profiling by race less specific or applicable. Ethnicity is often combined with race in the literature. In the census the choice of Hispanic or non-Hispanic is the main ethnicity indicator. Within the Hispanic (Latino) ethnicity, a wide diversity of culture, experience, and dialect is embraced. Geography is also an important component; the experience of immigrant groups may be very different depending on the area into which they immigrated—the east or west coasts or the south. Age is a somewhat visually identifiable characteristic. However, age in itself does not imply a certain set of health information needs. An elderly grandmother taking on the primary parenting role in her family will have different health information needs than a never-married frequent traveler of the same age. Physical aspects of aging may require attention to material formats, such as the need for audiovisuals or large print type. Sexual orientation is another characteristic according to which communities are formed. For example, in New York City the Michael Callen-Audre Lorde Community Health Center brings together lesbians, gays, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) individuals from a variety of geographic, racial, ethnic, age, and faith groups around a menu of health services regardless of ability to pay. It is often difficult to find health information materials that are evidence-based but sensitive to the concerns of individuals with diverse sexual orientations. The Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (2001) recently released the first comprehensive document on the state of LGBT health. Faith-based communities are a relativity recent focus area of health education. Many religious organizations have historically provided parish nurses, but the place of worship is now being further developed as a trusted source of health information and planned health activities. A survey by Hale and Bennett (2003) of clergy found that 72 percent said it was “very important” and 28 percent said it was “somewhat important” to actively address 272 library trends/fall 2004 the health needs of their congregations. Some faith-based organizations may not be willing or able to provide information that goes against the tenets of their religion. Awareness of these issues is essential in providing appropriate materials for faith-based health fairs and other events. Once the communities to be served by the library have been defined, there are many ways to get to know the needs of the various communities better. Outreach to Communities Ben Ocon and REFORMA offer several ways to get to know a Latino community on the Utah State Library Division Web site (Ocon, 2003). Studying the demographic statistics of your service area is the method most often employed by libraries. However, the time it takes to compile and distribute these statistics may mean that they are not accurate if your community is mobile. The local school district’s statistical profile of student enrollment may be a more timely resource, but it will not capture information on community members not tied to schools. Community leaders, particularly religious leaders, elected officials, and parent organizations may have their fingers on the pulse of the community, especially those members who are supportive of their organizations. Patronizing local businesses also may provide an idea of what health activities and products are available and what information or programming might be needed. Getting in touch with the communities in order to assess information needs is absolutely essential. In addition to keeping track of reference desk inquiries, contacting local ethnic organizations and newspapers, churches, and community groups can lead to opportunities for collection building and outreach. Ideas promoted by Alire and Archibeque (1998) include attending meetings and community fairs, writing articles for local newsletters, and creating flyers to distribute at community centers and local businesses. If there are no bilingual staff members at the library, work with members of the community to identify information needs and create materials. Contact local hospitals, clinics, and health care agencies to learn about the health needs of the neighborhoods they serve. Make an effort to obtain books, pamphlets, and videos about the most common illnesses and health issues faced by the library’s community.

0bd3363b3b645970d4e8e9a95dae800a9ff031ff	a multimedia platform for mexican cultural heritage diffusion		New Web technologies that allow greater interaction among users have emerged in the Internet. In such a way that now it is common for users to participate actively by writing, publishing, exchanging or sharing digital content over the Internet. This fact has allowed the emergence of web communities, web services, social networking services, wikis, blogs, etc. that are developed on a specific topic. This paper presents a multimedia web platform for the creation, edition and dissemination of historical cultural contents. Security strategies are considered in the design and implementation of the interactive platform. A digital platform with this purpose is very important due to the great cultural heritage of Mexico. We evaluate the operation of our platform with cultural information related with different historic stages of Mexico such as prehispanic, colonial and independent. Our proposal seeks that the population has knowledge of cultural and historical contents in order to continuing preserve their cultural heritage.

The origin of the field as a potential aid to the development of library and information services is noted, as is the transition from this status to that of a subject for research at PhD level and beyond. The development of the field has thus led to a division between the needs of academia for theoretically grounded work, and the needs of the field of practice for guidance for service development. There is, today, a disconnection between research and practice, to a significant extent: early research was undertaken by practitioners but today academic research dominates the scene. Suggestions are made as to how this disconnection can be repaired.		Tom Wilson	2008	J.

c5511268ac475e4143dd9a534fe2db9e7e7c773e	an introduction to the special issue	normative theory	I t has long been acknowledged that there are overlapping neural circuits for food and drugs of abuse. In particular, regions of the brain and intracellular signaling cascades implicated in processing the reinforcing effects of food also appear to regulate the consumption of addictive drugs (1–3). What is being ardently debated is whether overlapping substrates imply that food is, or can be, addictive (4,5). This is a critical question because it is attractive to use the addiction framework to jump-start and guide our understanding of how neural circuits of reward and self-control might contribute to understanding overeating and the obesity epidemic. However, the price of adopting an inappropriate framework is high, as it might steer research toward evaluating mechanisms that have been shown to be critical for addiction at the expense of those that are unique to obesity and perhaps key to understanding overeating. Reflecting both the gravity and uncertainty of this decision, the American Psychiatric Association considered and then rejected the inclusion of food as one of the addictive substances in the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Similarly, when the National Institutes of Health was considering merging the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism into a single Institute of Addiction-Related Research, the idea of including food was considered and then rejected. In both cases, insufficient scientific understanding was cited as critical to the decision. The goal of this special issue is to bring together original research findings, reviews, and opinions of leaders in the field to objectively represent the current state of knowledge, to consider the costs and benefits of adopting the addiction model, and to identify critical future directions.

6012c6dd172aaea0463579ddc22f29bc568d1501	the network structure of nanotechnology research output of turkey: a co-authorship and co-word analysis study		This paper aims to assess the diffusion of nanotechnology knowledge within the Turkish scientific community using co-citation and co-word analysis techniques. We retrieved a total of 10,062 records of nanotechnology papers authored by Turkish researchers between 2000 and 2011 from Web of Science (WoS) and divided the data set into two 6-year periods. We identified the most prolific and collaborative top 15 universities in each period based on their network properties. We then created co-authorship networks of Turkish nanotechnology researchers in each period and identified the most prolific and collaborative top 15 authors on the basis of network centrality coefficients. Finally, we used co-word analysis to identify the major nanotechnology research fields in Turkey on the basis of the co-occurrence of words in the titles of papers. Findings show that nanotechnology research in Turkey continues to increase due to researchers collaborating with their colleagues. Turkish researchers tend to collaborate within their own groups or universities and the overall connectedness of the network is thus low. Their publication and collaboration patterns conform to Lotka’s law. They work mainly on nanotechnology applications in Materials Sciences, Chemistry and Physics, among others.

Design/methodology/approach The argument uses examples from an empirical study of 43 in-depth interviews of academic staff in three disciplines, Chemistry, Computer Science and Sociology, at two Australian universities. The interviewees discussed their interaction with the literature as an author, a reader and a reviewer. Findings Disciplines are markedly different from one another, in terms of their subject matter, the speed of publication, information seeking behaviour and social norms. These all have bearing on the likelihood a given group will adopt deposit into an institutional repository as part of their regular work practice. Practical implications It is important to decide the purpose of the institutional repository before embarking on an advocacy program. By mapping empirical findings against both diffusion of innovations theory and writings on disciplinary differences, this paper shows that repository advocacy addressing the university academic population as a single unit is unlikely to be successful. Rather, advocacy and implementation of a repository must consider the information seeking behaviour and social norms of each discipline in question. What is original/value of paper The consideration of disciplinary differences in relation to repository advocacy has only begun to be explored in the literature.	access control;computer science;email;information seeking behavior;kingsley (youtube);norm (social);software repository;subject matter expert turing test	Danny Kingsley	2008	OCLC Systems & Services	10.1108/10650750810914210	computer science;knowledge management;management science;empirical research;world wide web;information system;norm	HCI	-74.35787220688684	-19.662429464017556	176785

The sum of impact factors of the journals referenced (Total Weighted Impact) was calculated by scientific fields. About 50–60 per cent of scientific information referred to in the patents was found to originate from Life Sciences journals. It was found that 10 per cent of the journals referenced contained 55 per cent of the papers.	software patent	Peter Vinkler	1994	Scientometrics	10.1007/BF02017229	scientometrics;computer science;evaluation;operations research;citation analysis;world wide web	HPC	-75.5872497102745	-22.664234346123337	178165

During and after his lifetime, the school carried out detailed comparative anatomical and embryological investigations in an evolutionary framework, thereby contributing substantially to the project of vertebrate evolutionary morphology. Its members also defended their mentor when his ideas came under attack. After his death, they labored to perpetuate his program and his memory in the increasingly unwelcoming environment of medical education and research. While the senior members of the school did this largely through institutional means-seeking to place Gegenbaur sympathizers in academic and editorial positions-its junior members absorbed some of the criticisms of the school to develop a modified, more functional approach to evolutionary morphology. The school thus kept the Gegenbaur program alive and active in the German-speaking lands for over fifty years.	evolutionary programming;functional approach;galaxy morphological classification;mathematical morphology	Lynn K.

A set of affirmative-response evaluation features are identified across four quality categories— currency/authority, accuracy, objectivity and privacy— and are used as the basis for determining the fundamental quality of Weblocated health information. Furthermore, the researchers add a value dimension to the framework by using a weighted average technique allowing information features to be scored proportionally— a feature that other assessment frameworks tend to overlook. The framework was used to test 56 health information documents published on the Web, concluding that only four pages addressed all the core criteria proposed in the framework. The study also found that a relatively high number of commercial health sites intermixed health information with product promotion and advertising. The study was exploratory and because sampling was not probalistic, it is difficult to claim generalisability at this stage. However, some notable results identified in this study may serve as the foundations for future research.	objectivity/db;sampling (signal processing);world wide web	Carmine Sellitto;Stephen Burgess	2005	J.

The purpose of the Map was in fact “to shed light on the vast amount of resources that represent the background of the research presented at LREC”. It also aimed at a “change of culture in the field, actively engaging each researcher in the documentation task about resources”. The data analysed here have been provided by the authors of several conferences during the phase of submission of papers, and contain information about ca. 7500 resources. We analysed the LRE Map data from many different viewpoints and the paper reports on the global picture, on different trends emerging from the diachronic perspective and finally on some comparisons between the 2 major conferences present in the Map: LREC and COLING.	circa;documentation;geforce 7 series;lre map	Riccardo Del Gratta;Sara Goggi;Gabriella Pardelli;Nicoletta Calzolari	2018			artificial intelligence;natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science	AI	-71.0376616603179	-19.192921091917402	178951

Given that research universities now emphasize increasing external revenue flows through marketing of intellectual property, we expected copyright to follow the path of patents and lead to institutional emphasis of policies and practices that enhanced universities' intellectual property portfolios, accompanied by an increase in copyrighting by professors. Although this pattern occurred with regard to institutions, professors offered a more varied pattern, with some fully participating in commercialization of copyright and embracing entrepreneurial values, while others resisted or subverted commercial activity in favor of traditional science and engineering values.	academia (organization);choice behavior;darknet market;engineering;flow;freedom of information laws by country;gari (substance);html link type - copyright;information sciences;intellectual property;learning disorders;legal patent;mental association;occupations;otitis externa;policy;textbooks;universities;value (ethics);warez;funding grant	Sheila Slaughter;Gary Rhoades	2010	Science and engineering ethics	10.1007/s11948-009-9162-1	public relations;engineering ethics;economics;engineering;sociology;management;law;intellectual property	SE	-73.69942630587953	-19.32615424856157	179385
3dff50d7476b79ad233e7aa2373ba5bbcfb928e0	is google scholar useful for bibliometrics? a webometric analysis	top institutions;webometrics;google scholar;bibliometrics;geographical coverage;quality control	Google Scholar, the academic bibliographic database provided free-of-charge by the search engine giant Google, has been suggested as an alternative or complementary resource to the commercial citation databases like Web of Knowledge (ISI/Thomson) or Scopus (Elsevier). In order to check the usefulness of this database for bibliometric analysis, and especially research evaluation, a novel approach is introduced. Instead of names of authors or institutions, a webometric analysis of academic web domains is performed. The bibliographic records for 225 top level web domains (TLD), 19,240 university and 6,380 research centres institutional web domains have been collected from the Google Scholar database. About 63.8% of the records are hosted in generic domains like .com or .org, confirming that most of the Scholar data come from large commercial or non-profit sources. Considering only institutions with at least one record, one-third of the other items (10.6% from the global) are hosted by the 10,442 universities, while 3,901 research centres amount for an additional 7.9% from the total. The individual analysis show that universities from China, Brazil, Spain, Taiwan or Indonesia are far better ranked than expected. In some cases, large international or national databases, or repositories are responsible for the high numbers found. However, in many others, the local contents, including papers in low impact journals, popular scientific literature, and unpublished reports or teaching supporting materials are clearly overrepresented. Google Scholar lacks the quality control needed for its use as a bibliometric tool; the larger coverage it provides consists in some cases of items not comparable with those provided by other similar databases.	bibliographic database;bibliographic record;bibliometrics;google scholar;scientific literature;scopus;software repository;web of science;web search engine	Isidro F.

Consultancy projects over many years had repeatedly shown us similar faults and weaknesses in the ways that firms manage their information—especially the kinds of information that are not looked after by information specialists or trained library staff. It was difficult, however, to draw firm conclusions from these scattered impressions and instances. The organizations we had worked in were of all shapes and sizes—industrial and commercial enterprises, government departments, international organizations and research associations. Their only common characteristic was that at one time or another they had come to us for advice, thus admitting an awareness that something was wrong!		P. H.

The method is based on a special property of Polish last names, namely several popular last names have separate masculine (-ski, -cki) and feminine (-ska, -cka) forms. In this respect Polish is different from most other languages, in which the last name has only one form independent of the gender. A set of 56634 unique publications of authors bearing one of 26 most popular -ski or -cki names was analyzed. The male dominance was observed over the entire studied period, yet it became systematically less significant over the period 1995–2014, especially in terms of production.	binocular disparity	Marek Kosmulski	2015	J.

To do this,we draw on the existing IS literature to show that the conceptualization of information and communication technologies (ICT) also shapes the conceptualizations of information, people, level of analysis, and research method. For evidence, we draw on two sources of IS literature: the research articles from the journal Information Systems Research (ISR) and the books published by the International Federation on Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group on Information Systems in Organization and Society (WG 8.2). Our analysis of the literature published in these two venues shows substantial differences in the conceptualization of all five constructs and attributes. In particular, there is great diversity across all five constructs and attributes in the ISR literature. The IFIP WG8.2 literature also displays a broad approach to conceptualizing ICT. In contrast to the work in ISR, the work in IFIP WG8.2 publications is also characterized by a small range of, and often nearly singular, Part 2: Analytical Frameworks 110 approaches to information, people, level of analysis, and research method. Further, more than 55 percent of the articles provide little insight into the specifics of the ICT being discussed. Combined with the uses of social theories, intensive and theory-building approaches to research, and the focus on institutional levels of analysis, the IFIP WG8.2 literature may be difficult for other IS scholars to understand, even if it is more singular in its approaches. These findings suggest that the published IS literature may also be relatively inaccessible to scholars who work within the various subcommunities of this pluralistic scientific community. The diversity of approaches also means that the IS community, and scholars in other areas who might use IS research, would value work that theorizes the relationships among the various conceptualizations of ICT.	book;british national vegetation classification;conceptualization (information science);information systems research;information system;international federation for information processing;online analytical processing;theory	Steve Sawyer;Tina T.

It explores the current research and development in the high-tech electronic companies in Taiwan, and the relationship between companies and industries. Fifty-eight high-tech electronic companies under this study, between 1998 and 2000, obtained 4162 patents from U.S., and cited 24,852 patents during these years. Through the data from bibliographic coupling analysis, the paper categorizes these companies into 6 major groups: semiconductor, peripheral, scanners, notebook / monitor, system, IC design / packaging. This research also uses multidimensional scaling to plot out a patent citation map, graphically displaying the association among the groups. The result shows a higher similarity among companies in semiconductor sector, whereas the distinction between industries grows more and more ambivalent, even overlapping in some cases.	bibliographic coupling;cluster analysis;coefficient;disk sector;image processor;image scaling;information retrieval;integrated circuit design;multidimensional scaling;peripheral;semiconductor	Mu-Hsuan Huang;Li-Yun Chiang;Dar-Zen Chen	2003	Scientometrics	10.1023/B:SCIE.0000006876.29052.bf	electronics;multidimensional scaling;computer science;information mapping;operations management;data mining;operations research;citation analysis;world wide web	ML	-74.19657828053039	-22.724344893594335	182157

The purpose of this report is to review the submission policies of major academic journals in the field of radiology and assess current editorial practices relating to electronic submission of academic works. The authors surveyed 16 radiologic journals that are indexed in the Index Medicus and available in our medical center library. They compared the manuscript submission policies of these journals as outlined in recent issues of the journals and the corresponding worldwide web sites. The authors compared the journals on the following criteria: web site access to instructions; electronic submission of text, both with regard to initial submission and final submission of the approved document; text hardcopy requirements; word processing software restrictions; electronic submission of figures, figure hardcopy requirements; figure file format restrictions; and electronic submission media. Although the trend seems to be toward electronic submission, there currently is no clear-cut standard of practice. Because all of the journals that accept electronic documents also require a hardcopy, many of the advantages gained through electronic submission are nullified. In addition, many publishers only utilize electronic documents after a manuscript has been accepted, thus utilizing the benefits of digital information in the printing process but not in the actual submission and peer-review process.	compiler;digital data;editorial;gain;index medicus;journal;manuscripts;policy;printing;radiology;regulatory submission;requirement;web site;world wide web;benefit;nullified - managedparticipationstatus	Grant W.

Merton's perspective on how priority relates to the provision of the public good knowledge. Economists have long been interested in the provision of the class of goods that are referred to as “public.” By definition, public goods are not used up when consumed and are goods from which it is difficult to exclude potential users. The provision of public goods presents special challenges to the market that do not exist in the provision of private goods. Scientific research has properties of a public good. Merton recognized the public nature of science. In this he was not alone. The genius of Merton is that he not only recognized that science has properties of a public good but stood the public-private distinction on its head, proposing that the reward structure of science, based on priority, functioned to make a public good private. In economic terms, Merton recognized that it is the public nature of knowledge that facilitates establishing the idea as the private property of the scientist.	application lifecycle management;arrow (computer science);audio messaging interchange specification;robert;scientometrics	Paula E.

Quantitative content analysis was carried out on the data, data were analysed in order to project literature growth, authorship pattern, gender pattern, cited references pattern and related bibliometric phenomena. The analysis indicates that there were as many as 1636 articles published during 2000–2004 with an average increment of 23.75 articles per year. The authorship pattern indicates that team research has not been very common in LIS OA publishing and male authors were keener than female authors. Authors from academic institutions were paid more interest in OA publishing and most of them were from developed nations. The subject coverage of these OA e-journals was very vast and almost all facets of information and library science were covered in these articles. There were 90.10% of articles of these e-journals contained references and on an average an article contained 24 references. Of these, 38.53% of references were hyperlinked and 87.35% of hyperlinked references were live during investigation. The analysis of data clearly indicates that OA e-journals in LIS are rapidly establishing themselves as a most viable media for scholarly communication.	bibliometrics;hyperlink;lis (programming language);library and information science;library science;scholarly communication	Bhaskar Mukherjee	2008	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-008-2055-2	developing country;content analysis;computer science;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-77.11293318790482	-21.015362390510724	185758

We analyzed their dates of submission and of final decision to accept and investigated whether the difference between these two dates (the so-called “time to accept”) is smaller for the articles authored by the corresponding journal’s editorial board members and whether longer times to accept yield higher citation counts. The main results are that we found significantly shorter times to accept editorial board member’s articles only in Journal of Informetrics and not in the other two journals, and that articles in any of these journals that took longer to be accepted did not receive markedly more citations.	electrical engineering;information processing and management;informetrics	Dalibor Fiala;Cecília Havrilová;Martin Dostál;Ján Paralic	2016	Publications	10.3390/publications4030021	library science;public relations;medicine;operations research	Web+IR	-76.67460810352652	-20.68587244323005	186079

We triangulated data from a small number of volunteer full-time faculty members of Long Island University, using three different research techniques: (1) questionnaire survey, (2) focus groups, and (3) semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The study identified some significant differences by discipline, gender, and tenure status. Overall, the three most important attributes were the reputation of the journal, the estimated length of time to article publication, and the readership of the journal. Our findings bring new insight into this area for the scholarly research community as a whole.		John J.

48f451ecb5d5241a7780bf07ac15b4e5699c5c41	visions of xanadu: paul otlet (1868-1944) and hypertext		The work of the Belgian internationalist and documentalist, Paul Otlet (1868-1944), and his colleagues in Brussels, forms an important and neglected part of the history of information science. They developed a complex of organizations that are similar in important respects functionally to contemporary hypertext/hypermedia systems. These organizations effectively provided for the integration of bibliographic, image, and textual databases. Chunks of text on cards or separate sheets were created according to “the monographic principle” and their physical organization managed by the Universal Decimal Classification, created by the Belgians from Melvil Dewey’s Decimal Classification. This article, discusses Otlet’s concept of the Office of Documentation and, as examples of an approach to actual hypertext systems, several special Offices of Documentation set up in the International Office of Bibliography. In his Trait6 de Documentation of 1934, one of the first systematic treatises on what today we would call information science, Otlet speculated imaginatively about telecommunications, text-voice conversion, and what is needed in computer workstations, though of course he does not use this terminology. By assessing how the intellectual paradigm of nineteenth century positivism shaped Otlet’s thinking, this study suggests how, despite its apparent contemporaneity, what he proposed was in fact conceptually different from the hypertext systems that have been developed or speculated about today. Such as analysis paradoxically also suggests the irony that a “deconstructionist” reading of accounts of these systems might find embedded in them the positivist approach to knowledge that the system designers would seem on the face of it explicitly to have repudiated.	database;dewey decimal classification;documentalist;documentation;embedded system;hypermedia;hypertext;information science;programming paradigm;project xanadu;universal decimal classification;workstation	W.

On a macro level, evidence was found that applied research was more highly invoked on the non-academic Web than pure research, but only in one of the two fields studied. On a micro level, instances of clear evidence of the transfer of academic knowledge to a commercial setting were sparse. Science research on the Web seems to be invoked mainly for marketing purposes, although high technology companies can invoke published academic research as an organic part of a strategy to prove product effectiveness. We conjecture that invoking academic research in business Web pages is rarely of clear commercial benefit to a company and that, except in unusual circumstances, benefits from research will be kept hidden to avoid giving intelligence to competitors.	sparse matrix;web page;world wide web	Mike Thelwall	2004	Online Information Review	10.1108/14684520410531655	web mining;scientific method;webometrics;computer science;web page;business intelligence;operations research;world wide web	AI	-73.45649752505695	-22.64040731031488	187014

Degree of adhesion to the scientific communication of electronic base: study of case in the area of the genetics. Rio de Janeiro: UFRJ/ECO – MCT/IBICT, 2005. 223f. Thesis (Doctor of Information Science). Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are changing the traditional scientific communication cycle and imposing meaningful transformations to the generation, production, circulation, dissemination, retrieval and use of information. They are influencing in different ways and levels the practices and results of the scientific activity, specially the intellectual outputs published in journal articles. This investigation analyses in what degree Brazilian researchers in genetics, working with genomics, have approved the new scientific communication standards introduced by ICTs. The results show these researchers have not yet approved the changes made by ICTs to the scientific communication cycle or, in other words, that during the period of this study electronic technologies did not altered significantly the formal processes of scientific communication in this area. Key-words: information science; information and communication technologies (ICTs); scientific communication – genetics; scientific journals.

Design/methodology/approach – Along with the current W3C standards, the current Federal codes and regulations were examined, and in the case of codes and regulations, reaffirmed by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. Findings – Despite the absence of an explicit connection between Section 504 and Section 508, public and private academic colleges and universities libraries must provide accessible web sites, as guaranteed by the “effective communication” standard found in Section 504 as interpreted by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, as well as Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Research limitations/implications – Having the authority to withhold Federal funding, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has successfully mandated accessible academic web sites where a complaint has been submitted. Practical implications – The research will provide academic library web developers with a comprehensive legal and practical framework and rationale for providing an accessible library web site for all. Originality/value – The research provides a comprehensive view of web accessibility standards and laws as they apply to academic libraries.

Todayu0027s digital libraries include interactive multimedia and powerful tools for searching and sharing content and experience. As such, digital libraries are moving beyond personal intellectual prostheses to become much more participative and reflective of social history. Digital libraries not only acquire, preserve, and make available informational objects, but also invite annotation, interaction, and leverage usage patterns to better serve patron needs. These various kinds of usage patterns serve two purposes: first, they serve as context for finding and understanding content, and second, they themselves become content that digital libraries must manage and preserve. Thus, digital library research has expanded beyond technical and informational challenges to consider new opportunities for recommendations, support of affinity groups, social awareness, and cross-cultural understanding, as well as new challenges related to personal and group identity, privacy and trust, and curating and preserving ephemeral interactions. This trend makes digital libraries cultural institutions that reveal and hopefully preserve the phenotypes of societies as they evolve. This talk will illustrate this theoretical perspective with examples from our experience with the Open Video Digital Library over the past decade and with recent extensions (VidArch Project) that harvest YouTube video as a strategy for preserving cultural context for digital collections.	digital library;library (computing)	Gary Marchionini	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04346-8_1	digital transformation;digital library;computer science;digital media;multimedia;collective identity;interactive media;world wide web;social consciousness	AI	-70.68525370274808	-19.91549208085674	191925

2ebad416aa53b9869267bb58cdff4d86f41fd421	influence of human behaviour and the principle of least effort on library and information science research		Introduction The principle of least effort (PLE), a concept advanced by the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, indicates that people complete tasks by choosing the way of least effort among various options (Zipf, 1949). To prove that the PLE is an indication of human nature, Zipf analyzed numerous empirical data collected from various human activities and used mathematical formulae to explain his findings. Zipf explained the PLE in detail in his classic 1949 entitled Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort: An Introduction to Human Ecology (HBPLE). The PLE represents a common human behavior; it may thus be expected that the HBPLE has become visible in various fields and applied to various human activities. HBPLE was also compared with similar theories and was reconceptualized in the field of library and information science (LIS) (Austin, 2001; Gratch, 1990). The LIS publications on PLE have indicated that the concept of the PLE is connected to various topics (Bronstein, 2008; Chrzastowski, 1995, 1999; Kim, 1982; Wang, 2001). This paper presents partial results of a research project for exploring the interdisciplinary influences of HBPLE. The focuses is this paper are on which concepts and citation functions of HBPLE were cited by authors of LIS articles that were published between 1949 and 2013. We analyzed citation frequency trends and the research topics of citing articles to identify emerging trends in the influence of HBPLE on LIS research and to determine which topics in LIS research have involved applying the concepts in HBPLE. In addition, citation context analysis was used to identify the cited concepts and the citation functions of HBPLE; thus, whether the PLE was the most frequently cited concept in HBPLE and the reasons HBPLE was cited were identified. The results may contribute to the understanding how a classic book on linguistics has influenced LIS research.	ecology;kingsley (youtube);library and information science;theory;zipf's law	Yu-Wei Chang	2015			principle of least effort;management science;library science;political science	AI	-77.22435227202793	-20.164746664138807	192769

About two thirds of knowledge has come from foreign sources and 94% of them are from English materials. Research Policy is the most frequently cited journal followed by Harvard Business Review, R&D Management and American Economic Review. An analysis of who cites the most highly cited journal is also included. Neo-Schumpeterians in Korea cite more papers from Research Policy than general researchers, and there is no difference between groups in the year of citation.	citation analysis;neo 1973	Sung-Soo Seol;Jung-Min Park	2007	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-007-1826-5	scientific method;computer science;citation analysis;world wide web	Web+IR	-74.57838569237282	-22.520329194126514	192853

The sample comprised two macro-domains—the most productive and the least productive. The former was the area of social sciences (SoS), covering such disciplines as information and documentation, communication, education, management, etc. The latter was the area of health sciences (HeS), covering such disciplines as medicine, nursing, etc. The objective of the study was to analyse the evolution of research activity during this period, taking into account the authors’ production, the distribution and co-authorship of the works, the affiliation, and the most frequently used journals. A quantitative and qualitative methodological approach was taken, based on statistical, mathematical, and content analyses. The results showed exponential growth of the scientific publications in both domains (R 2 = 0.9544 for SoS, and R 2 = 0.9393 for HeS), with a predominance of Anglo-Saxon authors. Author productivity was low (1.29 and 1.12 papers/author), while the dispersion of articles by journal averaged 4.96 in SoS and 1.86 in HeS. Scientific collaboration exceeded 53 % in the SoS domain and 69 % in HeS. There was a major dispersion of the places of the authors’ affiliation. In both domains, the author distributions fitted Lotka’s law, and the journal distributions Bradford’s Law.	apple sos;bibliometrics;bradford's law;coefficient;content repository api for java;database;documentation;information literacy;lotka's law;scientific literature;scopus;time complexity;web of science	Maria Pinto;Maria Isabel Escalona;Antonio Pulgarín	2012	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-012-0899-y	mathematics education;social science;computer science;data mining;sociology;world wide web	DB	-76.61094036726927	-21.449157763258835	193110

The data have been extracted from a database, which has been developed in-house from MEDLINE, SCI, TDB, Ovid Heath Information and Indian Science Abstracts. Study indicates that the exponential model fits the data on journals, articles and authors. The R2 value for the trend for journals, articles, and authors are 0.9502, 0.9475, and 0.9651, respectively. The growth rates for journals, articles and authors are 5.31%, 7.38%, and 10.06%, respectively. The linear multiple regression equation that Articles = −39.2771 + 3.61719*journals + 0.085882*Authors (R2 = 99.16%) is most meaningful and it may be used to estimate the articles for given numbers of journals and authors. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to determine how information about changing word frequencies and word patterns relates to the kind of information gained through the more traditional approach of intellectual history. Additionally, we consider what each approach can reveal about the information flows involved in the production and utilization of knowledge in teletraffic. In terms of methodology, the goal of this dual approach is to understand how the analysis of word and document structures can be used both as a scientometric tool and as a tool for historical research. We also comment more generally on the significance of conferences as an object for scientometric analysis, particularly with respect to the emergence and growth of the engineering and industrial sciences.	emergence;scientometrics;word lists by frequency	E.

In two priority fields of the Dutch programme, fermentation and bio-industrial chemistry, and biochemical genetics, publication rates were below world average before 1980–1981, but reached levels significantly above world average in 1984–1985. Both in 1980 and 1984, Dutch articles were characterized by a relatively high short-term impact. In 1984, the impact of Dutch articles was slightly above the 1980 level. When publications were counted in a core set of 19 biotechnology relevant journals, the share of Dutch biotechnologists did not change between 1979–1982 and 1983–1986, while Canada, Japan, France, and, to some extent, the UK, improved their positions, but the Federal Republic of Germany lost some ground.	british informatics olympiad	Anton J.

0a3d6fdc85bc18466026e2fae8594116f8769450	in-text author citation analysis: feasibility, benefits, and limitations	citation analysis	This article explores the feasibility, benefits, and limitations of in-text author citation analysis and tests how well it works compared with traditional author citation analysis using citation databases. In-text author citation analysis refers to author-based citation analysis using in-text citation data from full-text articles rather than reference data from citation databases. It has the potential to help with the application of citation analysis to research fields such as the social sciences that are not covered well by citation databases and to support weighted citation and cocitation counting for improved citation analysis results. We found that in-text author citation analysis can work as well as traditional citation analysis using citation databases for both author ranking and mapping if author name disambiguation is performed properly. Using in-text citation data without any author name disambiguation, ranking authors by citations is useless, whereas cocitation analysis works well for identifying major specialties and their interrelationships with cautions required for the interpretation of small research areas and some authors’ memberships in specialties.	american cryptogram association;book;bruce ellis;citation analysis;database;download;e-book;internationalized domain name;kelly criterion;laboratory information management system;samuel newman;tempest (codename);word-sense disambiguation	Dangzhi Zhao;Andreas Strotmann	2014	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23107	computer science;data mining;citation analysis;world wide web;information retrieval	ML	-77.0200298189167	-21.743714543202838	194331

Understanding when difference matters for design (“the difference that makes a difference,” to use anthropologist Gregory Bateson’s useful phrase) is at the heart of CI. We believe CI should center on diligent, critical, empirical analysis—what we call grounded comparison. To illustrate grounded comparison, we present a study of regional styles in word processing and an ethnographic investigation of online work groups. Both examples indicate the breadth of methodological approaches appropriate to comparative analysis, which also encompass traditional laboratory studies [2].	informatics;qualitative comparative analysis	Bonnie A.

One of the top executives or managers from each of the 39 companies, which volunteered to participate in the study, was interviewed. Participant input was sought on a carefully designed questionnaire, containing 19 questions, covering the scatter of information operations. It was noted that most of these companies were engaged in a number of activities for determining user needs and collecting, organising, servicing, packaging, searching and retrieving information from formal and structured information sources. Against this backdrop, the absence of any information unit or professional was quite significant. Little activity was also noted in the use of Web technology and Internet utilities. Another finding, worthy of the attention of the policy makers, was related to little activity in the organisation, control and use of the internal information sources of these companies.

By sharing this process others may be helped as they look for solutions and face similar situations. Design/methodology/approach – A reflective case study was chosen because it allowed the systems department to tell their story by reflecting on what had happened over the past two years. This is also a self study as the writers of the story are also the ones who experienced the events. Findings – The article provides a detailed account of choosing and implementing a CMS including insight into decisions, issues, and processes. The broad issues of usability, that usability is individualistic and task oriented, is portrayed. The hard work and difficulties involved in this type of project, especially for a small library, is recognized. Research limitations/implications – As this is one department’s experiences, it is not necessarily generalizable to other CMS projects or other libraries. Practical implications – Sharing experiences can give insight and guidelines to those who are contemplating similar decisions/implementations.

It provides support for the use of quantitative techniques to facilitate content analysis. The authors present a longitudinal latent semantic analysis of keywords. The proposed method is illustrated by two different examples: a scholarly journal (International Marketing Review) and conference proceedings (ENTER eTourism Conference). The methodology reveals an understanding of the current state of the art of marketing research and e-tourism by identifying neglected, popular or upcoming thematic research foci. The outcomes are compared with former results generated by traditional content analysis techniques. Findings confirm that the proposed methodology has the potential to complement qualitative content analysis, as the semantic analysis produces similar outcomes to qualitative content analysis to some extent. This paper reviews a journal’s content over a period of nearly three decades. The authors argue that the suggested methodology facilitates the analysis dramatically and can thus be simply applied on a regular basis in order to monitor topic development within a specific research domain.	latent semantic analysis;search engine optimization;semantic analysis (compilers);web search engine	Christian Weismayer;Ilona Pezenka	2017	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-017-2555-z	data mining;data science;tourism;content analysis;longitudinal study;marketing research;computer science;latent semantic analysis	Visualization	-76.11148331754754	-18.329520414099008	197550

Given its infancy, authors have rapidly created new measures to gauge their constructs of interest. Unfortunately, few of these authors have had the opportunity to test their scales' psychometric properties and validity. This is concerning, as many theoretical assumptions may be founded upon scales with inadequate attributes. If this were found to be true, then previous findings in cyberpsychology studies would need to be retested, and future research would need to shift its focus to creating psychometrically sound and valid measures. To provide inferences on this concern, the current study examines the article reporting, scale creation, and scale reliabilities of every article published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking from its inception to July 2014. The final data set encompassed the coding of 1,478 individual articles, including 921 scales, and spanning 17 years. The results demonstrate that the simple survey methodology has become more popular over time. Authors are gradually applying empirically tested scales. However, self-created measures are still the most popular, leading to concerns about the measures' validity. Also, the use of multi-item measures has increased over time, but many articles still fail to report adequate information to assess the reliability of the applied scales. Lastly, the average scale reliability is 0.81, which barely meets standard cutoffs. Overall, these results are not overly concerning, but suggestions are given on methods to improve the reporting of measures, the creation of scales, and the state of cyberpsychology.	cognition;cyberpsychology;emergence;file spanning;numerous;scientific publication;social characteristics	Matt C.

Australia's publication frequency vis-á-vis the world, its collaboration with authors from other nations, and the journals in which Australians most frequently publish are shown. Comparison of productivity is made for countries of similar scientific stature, or of language and Commonwealth status.	human height;information sciences institute;informetrics;optics algorithm;social sciences citation index;visual instruction set	Mari Davis;Concepción S.

A X/GDP productivity criteria is used where each country’s scientific wealth is represented by X, a second-order bibliometric indicator, and its nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is taken as a measure of its economic wealth. Singapore appears at the fifth position. This brief communication looks at the anatomy of this exceptional performance of the two city states, which are similar in many ways and yet dissimilar in many other ways. Hong Kong has the slight edge over Singapore in translating economic wealth to scientific wealth.	anatomic structures;bibliometrics;donkey kong country;gastroesophageal reflux disease;gross domestic product;influenza virus a hong kong ab:acnc:pt:ser:qn;sample rate conversion;semiconductor research corporation;universities;web site;standards characteristics	Gangan Prathap	2018	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-018-2927-z	regional science;data mining;top (position);bibliometrics;gross domestic product;computer science;ranking	HCI	-76.23210649546017	-20.582653021748285	198831

The paper explains copy cataloguing and its sources available to the Indian libraries for retrospective conversion.Findings – Copy cataloguing in India is not widespread. The supply of a “ready cataloguing” in MARC format by Indian publishers and supply agents is also not widely available.Practical implications – Copy cataloguing features have been implemented into the SOUL software and the IndCat, an online union catalogue of Indian universities for the Indian libraries.Originality/value – It is observed that copy cataloguing features have never been explained in one place for Indian libraries. The information provided in the paper will help the community at large.
