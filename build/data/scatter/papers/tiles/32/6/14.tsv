Today, the use of information permeates every aspect of both business and private lives. Most organizations need information systems to survive and prosper and thus need to be serious about protecting their information assets. Many of the processes needed to protect these information assets are, to a large extent, dependent on human cooperated behavior. Employees, whether intentionally or through negligence, often due to a lack of knowledge, are the greatest threat to information security. It has become widely accepted that the establishment of an organizational sub-culture of information security is key to managing the human factors involved in information security. This paper briefly examines the generic concept of corporate culture and then borrows from the management and economical sciences to present a conceptual model of information security culture. The presented model incorporates the concept of elasticity from the economical sciences in order to show how various variables in an information security culture influence each other. The purpose of the presented model is to facilitate conceptual thinking and argumentation about information security culture. a 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Obama administration views transparency and openness in government as a cost-effective and efficient process capable of improving public participation with government and public access to government information. To address the initiative in part, many agencies adopt social media as the means to disseminate information out to the public and to increase public participation with agency website content and activities. This exploratory study examines Executive agency use of social media and public participation with the media. Findings indicate that most agencies reviewed do use social media. The public does interact with the media and some agencies experience high overall participation levels; however, there are some issues with agency use of social media and public participation with the media.	social media	John T.

Fifteen years later, it is evident that the adoption of IPv6 has not progressed as expected, but recently it seems to be finally taking up. This paper reviews the past experiences and present state of IPv6 deployment in Croatia, followed by the ongoing assessment of IPv6 readiness and transition plans in public and private sectors. Future activities to raise awareness of IPv6 in Croatia and to stimulate its adoption in research and education communities, government and public authorities, and private sector are discussed.	internet;snapshot (computer storage);software deployment	Velimir Svedek;Ognjen Dobrijevic;Maja Matijasevic;Ivana Golub;Tomislav Stivojevic	2011	SoftCOM 2011, 19th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks		public relations;environmental resource management;business;computer security	SE	-76.86268468027227	-8.273747362433307	152200

This movement of data supports most aspects of the United States economy in particular, as well as, serving as the vehicle upon which governmental agencies react to social conditions. In addition, it is understood that the continuance of efficient and reliable data communications during times of national or regional disaster remains a priority in the United States. The coordination of emergency response and area revitalization / rehabilitation efforts between local, state, and federal emergency response is increasingly necessary as agencies strive to work more seamlessly between the affected organizations. Additionally, international support is often made available to react to such adverse conditions as wildfire suppression scenarios and therefore require the efficient management of workforce and associated logistics support. Various governmental and civilian organizations have been formed to serve as intermediaries for data communications during disaster response scenarios in an effort to streamline command and control channels for information. The preeminent disaster response agency in the United States federal government, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), has filed the """" Fiscal Year, 2000 Disaster Activity Overview """" report on major national disasters resulting primarily from extreme weather conditions and geographic occurrences [FEMA, 2000]. In addition, the need for wildfire suppression in various states resulted in declarations of emergency throughout the reported year. Various methods of supporting data transactions are available for use during nominal life activities in most communities such as terrestrial and extra-terrestrial based communication channels. However, during most emergencies, terrestrial connectivity is lost or diminished as a result of the occurrence and on occasion, the act of recovery from the occurrence. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the technological horizon to discover those technologies best suited to support during times of infrastructure contingencies. In addition to the examination of available technologies for use during emergency response and recovery operations, an investigation into methods of ensuring the integrity of transmitted data between parties must be undertaken. As the reliance upon wireless and other extra-terrestrial means of data communication increases as a result of disaster conditions, the accessibility of unauthorized persons to transmitted data increases as the data uses the environment as the transfer medium. The susceptibility of the data to interference and unauthorized monitoring causes concern from agencies managing such needed response and recovery actions as law enforcement and security, health and welfare, infrastructure …"""	accessibility;adobe streamline;authorization;data recovery;download;interference (communication);logistics;terrestrial television;wildfire modeling;zero suppression	Ronald M.

In spite of understanding the need for compliance, very few organizations actually have a good understanding of how to implement a system that will satisfy the requirements for electronic document retention and retrieval for litigation purposes. This paper suggests some positive steps that an organization can take to minimize the likelihood of court-imposed sanctions for noncompliance with discovery requests for electronic documents. The first step is the creation of an Information Management Team that includes experts in computer forensics, law, information management, information technology, and auditing. The next step is to develop and implement an electronic document retention and deletion policy. Any such policy must retain the flexibility to implement litigation holds by suspending routine document deletion when litigation is imminent.	computer forensics;electronic discovery	Vicki Miller Luoma	2006	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2006.01.002	computer science;data mining;retention period;information management;information technology;computer security;computer forensics;satisfiability	Crypto	-70.77130384853065	-8.372602516524069	155252

Erosion of privacy happens through either deliberate or inadvertent surveillance. Since Bentham's original liberal project in the 1900s, a literature and a whole study area around theories of surveillance has developed. Increasingly this general body of work has focussed on the role of information technology as a vehicle for surveillance activity. Despite an abundance of knowledge, a unified view of key surveillance concepts that is useful to designers of information systems in preventing or reducing unintended surveillance remains elusive. This paper contributes a conceptual model that synthesises the gamut of surveillance theories as a first step to a theory building effort for use by Information Systems professionals. The model is evaluated using a design science research paradigm using data from both examples of surveillance and a recently completed research project that developed technology for the UK youth justice system.	information system;orwell;privacy;programming paradigm;software development process;theory	Balbir S.

We propose the capitalisation of labour costs, the provision for costs caused in indirect value chains, environmental and social measures in scorecards, new remuneration schemas for managers, and a change in management attitudes towards knowledge management. The application of the combination of the proposed concepts could positively influence the distribution of wealth and resources, as societies could become more balanced world-wide. We are convinced that the proposed scorecard measures and the necessary change in management behaviour must be driven and supported by knowledge managers operating in world-wide value chains.

In particular, offshore operations rely heavily on digital technologies to gain remote access to subsea oil or natural gas fields, and are at the same time subject to strict requirements by authorities to prevent pollution in the marine environment. Operators are consequently dependent on models and representations to assess and predict environmental risk. However, the heterogeneous disciplines operating a field cannot count on a shared perspective on environmental risk as their activities span across organizational and political boundaries. We present a case study from a Norwegian oil and gas company that is developing a set of tools and methodologies for providing heterogeneous users with awareness of the risk for the cold-water coral reefs off the coasts of Norway. In particular, we focus on the articulation work carried on to let representations and models compensate for the inevitable lack of shared awareness of environmental risk while at the same time fit the existing sociotechnical infrastructure. We discuss actors’ strategies to foreground the infrastructure by: (1) bootstrapping the environmental data; (2) mediating with the existing corporate infrastructure; and (3) enacting the subsea context for operators.	art bowker;biconnected component;colette rolland;computer-supported cooperative work;consensus dynamics;digital artifact;fragmentation (computing);heterogeneous computing;immutable object;portals;real-time clock;requirement;sociotechnical system;traceability;unreachable memory;word lists by frequency	Elena Parmiggiani	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-06498-7_7	engineering;multimedia;advertising;world wide web	HCI	-74.33723609683878	-4.190272903528689	158563

Thereby, innumerable conflicting socio-economic interests collide through the Internet. Since self-interested stakeholders will try enforcing their interests through technological, economical, or judicial means, the Internet technology and related standards must not only be focused on technical engineering goals, but also need to ensure a fair playing field for all stakeholders. This necessity to consider socio-economic factors, when designing technology and standards, is slowly recognized by academia and standardization bodies and highlighted in this paper. The Tussle Analysis is presented as the first tool for assessing such a socio-economic awareness of Internet technology and related standards. The Tussle Analysis was standardized in Study Group (SG) 13 of the ITU-T and published as Recommendation Y.3013 in 2014. Thus, methods to implement the Tussle Analysis' three steps are presented and discussed throughout the paper.	internet;requirement;sonic generations;suicidegirls;switzerland;vii	Patrick Poullie;Corinna Schmitt;Burkhard Stiller	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)	10.1109/CSCN.2015.7390411	public relations;environmental resource management;political science;management science	Visualization	-72.8210728830123	-6.628919802180309	159630

Lessons learned about organizational benefits reaped from the organization’s decision-support practices include implications for such initiatives as data warehousing, data mining, and online analytical processing. INTRODUCTION Currently, new technologies such as data warehousing and data mining are considered necessary for harnessing organizational data for decision support. In practice, however, utilization of data, beyond transactional uses intended upon creation of the databases, took place for many years prior to the emergence of these technologies. Even today in fact, without applying specific data warehousing or data mining technologies to its existing databases, organizations may gain experience in value-added utilization of existing databases. This practice allows reaping some of the benefits of data warehousing and mining, on the basis of existing database systems, even before the respective technologies have matured. It should also be helpful eventually in adoption of and adaptation to these technologies. In this chapter we study such practice at Maccabi Healthcare Services, the second largest health maintenance organization (HMO) in Israel. Administrative information systems in healthcare organizations were developed as a tool for controlling and increasing the efficiency of billing and payment transactions between them and caregivers. Clinical information systems were developed somewhat later, mainly for the purpose of enhancing medical diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. While the main use of administrative and clinical systems has been for transactional purposes, parts of the resulting databases have been utilized for purposes other than transaction processing, such as identifying areas of medical care that could be targeted for savings, designing clinician compensation schemes, and attempting to change physician behavior towards adaptation to clinical guidelines. Following the next two sections, which review the literature and the casestudy methodology used this chapter, the fourth section focuses on a case of value-added utilization of existing databases for decision support purposes, in the context of disease management for asthma. The case demonstrates how being an early adopter of medical information systems for transaction processing paved the road to value-added utilization of existing databases for supporting disease-management decisions. The discussion section following presentation of case facts is devoted to the organizational benefits that were reaped in this case as well as to the lessons that can be learned and the limitations of using existing databases for decision-support. Finally, the concluding section presents implications for such initiatives as data warehousing, data mining, and online analytical processing, and proposes possible directions for future research. 17 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/chapter/demonstrating-value-addedutilization-existing/4623?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Books, InfoSci-Knowledge Management, Library Science, Information Studies, and Education, InfoSci-Library Information Science and Technology.

Recently universities have turned to ERP as a means of replacing existing management and administration computer systems. In this article we provide analysis of the rollout of an ERP system in one particular institution in the UK, the particular focus being on how the development, implementation and use of both generic and university specific functionality is mediated and shaped by a fundamental and long standing tension within universities: this is the extent to which higher education institutions are organisations much like any other and the extent to which they are 'unique'. The aim of this article is not to attempt to settle this issue of similarity/difference in one way or another. Rather, it seeks to illustrate the value of taking discussions of similarity relationships surrounding the university and other organisations as the topic of analysis. One way of working with these kinds of issues without resolving them is to consider their 'distribution' (where ERP shifts the responsibility for their resolution) and where their resolution is finally located. This is a novel and insightful way of understanding how ERP systems are refashioning the identity of universities. We suggest, moreover, that ERP software is 'accompanied' by such tensions. The research presented here is based on a participant observation study carried over the period of three years.	erp;enterprise resource planning	Neil Pollock;James Cornford	2004	IT & People	10.1108/09593840410522161	economics;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;sociology;management;law;world wide web;standardization	HCI	-76.79212133243163	-8.374716212004016	159958

Consequently, the demand for cybersecurity expertise is huge, posing remarkable challenges for cybersecurity competence and skills development. We analyze the current level of national cybersecurity competence in the light of our recent study carried out in Finland, a small country with strong emphasis on ICT industry. Furthermore, we propose high-level metrics categories for increasing cybersecurity level from national, business and educational perspectives, taking into account the findings of the above-mentioned study.	computer security;critical infrastructure protection;high- and low-level;holism;service innovation	Reijo Savola	2017		10.1145/3129790.3129804	computer security;information and communications technology;engineering	HCI	-77.21072711031277	-4.903136411285626	160201

First, the success by the OpenStreetMap and partly the free use of Google Maps have been a revelation for many users, both in the public sector as well as in the private sector. Additionally, several legal frameworks like the EU directive on Re-use of Public Sector Information and the INSPIRE Directive on geographic information have in various ways encouraged the re-use of public sector information. As a consequence, a minor group of European countries have launched their own open government data projects, and the current research focuses on the role of open public sector information as a major step towards a digital society by analysing the background, extent and expected impact of the Danish open government data initiative.

Whilst there is a clear need for access to information about the historic environment by a range of audiences actively engaged in the management of Europe’s rich heritage, delivery of relevant services is restricted to a narrow interpretation of the Annex I Protected Sites theme that focuses on statutory designations. This paper explores business reasons for adopting a more expansive interpretation of what information should be considered as and distributed as part of the Protected Sites theme in order to support policies and activities that impact upon the wider historic environment. The paper also considers the range and potential of information created through investigation and recording of the historic environment, often at public expense or interest. The potential for data reuse generating savings, inspiring smarter working practices, and developing sustainable datasets is explored through case studies from Scotland and Ireland and proposals to establish a thematic geo-portal, web services and applications through the EU Culture funded project ArchaeoLandscapes Europe (ArcLand), are discussed.	aerial photography;archive;best practice;copy protection;data infrastructure;directive (programming);freedom of information laws by country;host protected area;infrastructure for spatial information in the european community;interoperability;neo geo;orthophoto;proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions;relevance;sim lock;satellite digital imaging system;schedule;software documentation;team fortress 2;web feature service;web map service;web service;while	Peter McKeague;Anthony Corns;Robert Shaw	2012	IJSDIR		geography;industrial heritage;environmental protection;environmental resource management;cultural heritage management	Web+IR	-74.50109250104478	-5.363021724464417	161836

A systematic analysis of the service sector would show that the “commodity” on which this sector acts is “information.” The increasing importance of “information” for control and management in an “advancing” society is the primary reason for the structural shift of labor to the service sector. In this paper the critical importance of the service sector to development is emphasized and it is argued that information technology that underpins activity in this sector is an appropriate technology for speeding‐up socioeconomic development in the third world countries.

ca064c478a81518ec3c33590843ff6d888a1d76a	taking stock of organisations' protection of privacy: categorising and assessing threats to personally identifiable information in the usa		Many organisations create, store, or purchase information that links individuals’ identities to other data. Termed personally identifiable information (PII), this information has become the lifeblood of many firms across the globe. As organisations accumulate their constituencies’ PII (e.g. customers’, students’, patients’, and employees’ data), individuals’ privacy will depend on the adequacy of organisations’ information privacy safeguards. Despite existing protections, many breaches still occur. For example, US organisations reported around 4,500 PII-breach events between 2005 and 2015. With such a high number of breaches, determining all threats to PII within organisations proves a burdensome task. In light of this difficulty, we utilise text-mining and cluster analysis techniques to create a taxonomy of various organisational PII breaches, which will help drive targeted research towards organisational PII protection. From an organisational systematics perspective, our classification system provides a foundation to explain the diversity among the myriad of threats. We identify eight major PII-breach types and provide initial literature reviews for each type of breach. We detail how US organisations differ regarding their exposure to these breaches, as well as how the level of severity (i.e. number of records affected) differs among these PII breaches. Finally, we offer several paths for future research.	personally identifiable information;privacy	Clay Posey;Uzma Raja;Robert E. Crossler;A. J.

c23e7dcd2695182d113ae2fcd5d11ec263a0b875	security and privacy in e-consumer protection in victoria, australia		Governments in many countries have actively promoted both regulatory and self-regulatory approaches to govern e-commerce and to protect e-consumers. Nevertheless, the desired outcomes of e-consumer protection have not fully materialised. Although there are many research projects about ecommerce, security, privacy, trust, etc., few relate to e-consumer protection. In addition, most projects on e-consumer protection only focus on individual issues, rather than examining the entire coverage of the protection of e-consumers. This paper, a theoretical one, aims to fill these gaps by (i) identifying five issues in econsumer protection, (ii) discussing the current regulatory and non-regulatory framework of e-consumer protection, (iii) examining the effectiveness of this current framework, and (iv) proposing how this framework can be improved to address current and future problems. This paper will use Victoria, Australia as a case study and takes into account the view of all stakeholders.	data protection directive;e-commerce;emoticon;interdependence;online shopping;privacy;relevance;victoria (3d figure)	Huong Ha	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22200-9_19	public relations;environmental resource management;political science;computer security	Security	-72.35357874331012	-8.348383249714287	164123

In this paper, the experience is reported of a supervising institution, the Mato Grosso State Audit Court - TCE-MT that, when realigning its strategic planning in 2005, realized the need to install tools that confirm the accomplishment of its mission of supervising and orienting public managers with a closer approach to society. For this, and to strengthen communication with the general public, a constant website evaluation process has begun so that the TCE-MT would be able to fulfill the purpose of informing and ensuring transparency of its acts and of those under its jurisdiction, with the objective of getting the public interested in following the results of public policies. This meant it was important for the institution to have very clear web concepts, communication policies and strategic information management, including setting parameters with the electronic government concepts, and thus formulate its first website planning, aligned with the objectives of long term Institutional Planning. Therefore, this study shows the alignment of the institution's strategic planning to the website's technological evolution throughout the biennia in accordance with the electronic government guidelines.	e-government;ibm translation control entry;information management;web development	Natalina Namie Hirata Girata;Cristiano Maciel	2014		10.1145/2612733.2612774	public relations;strategic planning;knowledge management;management science;business	AI	-74.24346709149285	-5.886798682251806	164737
d824d746e2dc353bb24c4b04318dbcdb21ee55fb	interdisciplinarity in sustainability science: challenge or opportunity?		Over the last few decades, Sustainability Science (SS) has gained momentum and emerged in the academy with an extraordinary performance in knowledge production and contributions to the research and publications enterprise, growth in academic programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, creation of centers/laboratories, and formation of scientific communities, networks and associations. Increasingly, terms like integration, collaboration and bridging of fields and disciplinary boundaries are in the forefront of conversations and/or debates. The key question addressed by this review essay is this: Is interdisciplinarity in Sustainability Science a challenge or opportunity for educational institutions and local communities in the 21st century? Considering the recent momentum in educational advancements and institutional progress, the study outlines relevant literature on interdisciplinarity in SS; synthesizes recent thinking and developments in SS and attempts to address what challenges and opportunities people across the globe face in sustainability education and research and in the development of academic programs and sustainable communities. When scientists, policy makers, academics get together as teams, partners and collaborators they are likely to be engaged in interdisciplinary work and possibly doing sustainability research, policy development and problem-solving to deal with the pressing demands and challenges of the 21st century society. In this context, it is urgent in science and society to seek solutions to major sustainability problems such as climate change and one way to address that is by doing interdisciplinary work in Sustainability Science.

In order to design and implement resiliency measures, the unique characteristics of the sector must be thoroughly understood and incorporated into new paradigms of resiliency and risk. Risk in the sector is comprised of both physical and financial risk; the prominent financial risk, systematic risk, stems from irrational human behaviour, and thus, adverse shocks must be treated as Black Swan events, or as wholly unpredictable. Therefore, resiliency measures must concentrate on dampening the effects of adverse shocks (proactive resiliency measures) and effectively dealing with such shocks once they occur (reactive resiliency measures), rather than futilely trying to prevent them from occurring at all.

b1e1544a2e60e2ba65dcf7b587209bf7fdd1e317	protection of personal data in security alert sharing platforms		In order to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability (so called CIA triad) of data within network infrastructure, it is necessary to be able to detect and handle cyber security incidents. For this purpose, it is vital for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) to have enough data on relevant security events and threats. That is why CSIRTs share security alerts and incidents data using various sharing platforms. Even though they do so primarily to protect data and privacy of users, their use also lead to additional processing of personal data, which may cause new privacy risks. European data protection law, especially with the adoption of the new General data protection regulation, sets out very strict rules on processing of personal data which on one hand leads to greater protection of individual's rights, but on the other creates great obstacles for those who need to share any personal data. This paper analyses the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), relevant case-law and analyses by the Article 29 Working Party to propose optimal methods and level of personal data processing necessary for effective use of security alert sharing platforms, which would be legally compliant and lead to appropriate balance between risks.	computer emergency response team;computer security;confidentiality;data protection directive;general data protection regulation;high-level programming language;information privacy;information security;personally identifiable information;project merrimac	Václav Stupka;Martin Horák;Martin Husák	2017		10.1145/3098954.3105822	computer security;information sharing;confidentiality;cloud computing security;data security;internet privacy;general data protection regulation;computer science;intrusion detection system;data processing;data protection act 1998	Security	-71.05871635663183	-8.568709470429722	165745

Therefore, this paper aims at researching the status quo of such data in Austria and exploring related advantages and shortcomings. First, the presented survey is motivated and put in perspective to relevant related work. Then, the approach to gaining the datasets is described and important parameters are specified. Subsequently, the results of the conducted survey are presented. Positive as well as negative highlights are pointed out. Many datasets with good features have been identified, however, there are still some drawbacks concerning data quality, diversity and content. Dealing with these issues and ultimately providing Linked Open Data would greatly improve the datasets and, ultimately, would allow for significantly better utilisation thereof. The goal of this work is to bring the concept of Open Data into the environmental domain by evaluating the environmental Open Data landscape in Austria.	data quality;linked data	Peter Wetz;Amin Andjomshoaa;A Min Tjoa	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.777	computer science;data science;machine learning;group method of data handling;linked data;data mining;world wide web	Robotics	-75.10376541226233	-5.181236710668766	166637

The advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon have been debated over the years, but not extensively from an information security culture point of view. We therefore investigate information security design decisions made by an end user during an end user development project. The study is interpretative and the analysis is structured using the concept of inscriptions. Our findings show that end user development results in inscriptions that may induce security risks that organizations are unaware of. We conclude that it is a) important to include end user development as a key issue for information security management, b) to include end user developers as an important group for the development of a security-aware culture, and c) to address information security aspects in end user development policies.	end-user development;information security	Fredrik Karlsson;Karin Hedström	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07620-1_22	information security audit;computer security model;public relations;cloud computing security;end user;security through obscurity;security information and event management;asset;engineering;knowledge management;information security;logical security;information security standards;human-computer interaction in information security;security service;computer security;information security management	Crypto	-71.96572628080612	-7.251132538631026	166982

7e8e20de25985d8a7682e5b112aae61d33ced0cf	development of a european framework for e-government competences		The term e-government stands for an ICT enabled transformation of the public sector. New forms of collaboration and inter-organizational public service networks become feasible, to fulfill public tasks more efficiently and effectively. Even though e-government is being promoted by the EU, tangible results are rather scarce. The European Commission and the EU member countries therefore strive for a more coherent development of e-government within the EU. Nevertheless, it’s being implemented very differently in the EU member countries. One reason for this diverse development seems to be that different competences for the personnel of public administrations are associated with e-government in the EU member countries. This article describes the first steps of the development of an e-government competence framework. This framework is initially being developed in the COMPATeGov project with public administrations from Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, and Romania. The article sums up the first results of a literature review on e-government competences, a survey, and focus group workshops. It outlines a first set of e-government competences and concludes with a forecast of the next steps in the project, in order to validate and facilitate the results.	coherence (physics);e-government;first draft of a report on the edvac;focus group;microsoft outlook for mac;refinement (computing)	Sirko Schulz;Tino Schuppan	2012			knowledge management;e-government;business;competence (human resources)	NLP	-74.49902253448036	-5.532611949231413	167450

This attitude has had profound implications for the transfer of technology to and from other parts of the world, many of which have already been uncovered and others probably discerned in the future. The current trend toward globalization calls for new perspectives that can accommodate the broader issues of technology. In this paper, we seek to uncover some of the limitations of the traditional view as it relates to the education of information technology (IT), and to propose the perspective of social informatics as a viable alternative for the training of IT professionals. Our discussion is organized around three major themes: (1) Socio-cultural: Technology is a social phenomenon and technological systems are socially shaped. In contrast to the traditional accounts of technology, which tend to characterize IT as a tool, the view of social informatics portrays IT as a socio-technical network, where technological effects are indirect, contexts are complex (matrices of business, services, people, technology history, location, and so on), and issues of incentive, trust, and understanding are central. (2) Economical: Technology is resource-dependent. The utilization of technology requires the availability of various resources such as infrastructures for communication and transportation, services, skills, and so on. The availability of these resources varies from place to place and from time to time, and a technologist should be trained to deal with this variability on a global scale. (3) Organizational/Managerial: Technology is implemented, used, and carried out in and by organizations, where relationships are complex and negotiated, knowledge and expertise is distributed and implicit, and politics is often central. Furthermore, there is a great variability across cultures in terms of management styles, organizational structures and hierarchies, work philosophy, time management, and so on. A technologist should have sufficient training to understand these nuances in any given setting. Technological education of a kind that meets the demands and challenges of globalization should pay specific attention to the above aspects. In this paper, we discuss the components of a curriculum that could better meet the globalization challenge.	cardiovascular technologist;heart rate variability;social informatics;sociotechnical system;spatial variability	Pani N.

Many in the community have recognised this growth and sought to align themselves with analytics. For instance, the US operational research society INFORMS now offers analytics related conferences, certification and a magazine. However, as shown in this research, the volume of analytics-orientated studies in journals associated with operational research is comparatively low. This paper seeks to address this paradox by seeking to better understand what analytics is, and how operational research is related to it. To do so literature from a range of academic disciplines is analysed, in what is conceived as concurrent histories in the shared tradition of a management paradigm spread over the last 100 years. The findings of this analysis reveal new insights as to how operational research exists within an ecosystem shared with several other disciplines, and how interactions and ripple effects diffuse knowledge and ideas between each. Whilst this ecosystem is developed and evolved through interdisciplinary collaborations, individual disciplines are cast into competition for the attention of the same business users. These findings are further explored by discussing the implication this has for operational research, as well as considering what directions future research may take to maximise the potential value of these	align (company);ecosystem;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interaction;portable document format;programming paradigm;ripple effect;security through obscurity;terabyte;while	Michael J.

Recently, Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives emerged worldwide aiming to make public data freely available to everyone, without limiting restrictions. Despite its potential however there is currently a lack of roadmaps, guidelines and benchmarking frameworks to drive and measure OGD progress. This is particularly true as proposed stage models for measuring eGovernment progress focus on services and do not sufficiently consider data. In this paper, we capitalize on literature on eGovernment stage models and OGD initiatives to propose a stage model for OGD. The proposed model has two main dimensions, namely organizational & technological complexity and added value for data consumers. We anticipate the proposed model will open up a scientific discussion on OGD stage models and will be used by practitioners for constructing roadmaps and for benchmarking just like the European Union stage model is currently used for measuring public service online sophistication.	aggregate data;information privacy;plan;prototype;sim lock;wireless access point	Evangelos Kalampokis;Efthimios Tambouris;Konstantinos A.

In particular, the potential for open government data to generate data-driven entrepreneurship and scientific discovery has been the focus of much attention by both scholars and policy makers. In this article, we analyze the current perspectives on open government data intermediaries. Since it is a very recent phenomenon, the terminology used in this field is not clear, often leading to different terms being confused or used interchangeably. The framework proposed here is meant as an aid in the development of a coherent terminology for describing, comparing and discussing different approaches to these services.	coherence (physics);electronic discovery;human-readable medium	Gustavo Magalhaes;Catarina Roseira;Sharon Strover	2013		10.1145/2591888.2591947	public relations;knowledge management;business;management	ML	-76.1437466217195	-5.35553491292338	170116

The Library was the natural stakeholder to lead this project. Over the years, the service has been influenced by external and internal factors, and consequently the Library’s role in developing the OA agenda has changed. Here, we present the development and implementation of a fully mediated open access service at Surrey. The mediated workflow was introduced following an operational review, to ensure higher compliance and engagement from researchers. The size and responsibilities of the open access team in the Library increased to comply with internal and external policies and to implement the fully mediated workflow. As a result, there has been a growth in deposit rates and overall compliance. We discuss the benefits and shortcomings of Library mediation; its effects on the relationship between the Library, senior management and researchers, and the increasing necessity for the Library to lead towards a culture of openness beyond policy compliance.	active agenda;amiga reflections;librarian;library;library (computing);one-way function;open research;openness	Christine Antiope Daoutis;Maria de Montserrat Rodriguez-Marquez	2018	Publications	10.3390/publications6020020	public relations;knowledge management;mediation (marxist theory and media studies);curse;workflow;senior management;stakeholder;computer science;openness to experience;policy compliance	HPC	-74.50032700182004	-5.611322173894062	171445

In particular, we analyze the influence of patents on the rate of standard replacement. We investigate whether essential patents contribute to a “lock in” of outdated standards, or rather encourage investment and increase the pace of standardization. Building upon a comprehensive dataset of over 6.000 different standards and nearly 20.000 standard versions in the field of ICT, we evidence essential patents to reduce the likelihood of standard replacement in early stages. This effect takes place in the first three years after the standard is issued. On the other hand, declarations of essential patents increase the likelihood of version replacement. We argue that these version upgrades do not entail replacement of standard components. The effect on versions reflects an increase in the firms' investment in standardization, while the reduced rate of standard replacement in early years reflects a stabilizing effect of patents on standardization.	causal filter;interpro;lock (computer science)	Justus Baron;Knut Blind;Tim Pohlmann	2011	2011 7th International Conference on Standardization and Innovation in Information Technology (SIIT)	10.1109/SIIT.2011.6083600	engineering;marketing;operations management;sociology;law;information technology;commerce	DB	-77.28815091778195	-8.406972578408302	171566

In 2013, the National Library of New Zealand's National Digital Heritage Archive (NDHA) outsourced storage of its digital collections. A case study of the decision to outsource and its consequences was conducted, involving interviews of the representatives of three key stakeholders: IT, the NDHA, and the vendor. Clear benefits were identified by interviewees, together with two main challenges. The challenges related to occupational culture tensions, and a shift in funding models. Interviewees also considered whether the cultural heritage sector had any unique requirements. A key learning was that information managers were at risk of being excluded from the detail of outsourcing, and so needed to be prepared to assert their need to know based on their stewardship mandate.

The methodology is in essence based on the principles of knowledge management and the drivers of a system of innovation. The knowledge network, SA HealthInfo, aims to provide a one-stop interactive forum/resource, for quality-controlled and evidence-based health research information, to a wide spectrum of users, at various levels of aggregation, with the necessary security arrangements and facilities for interaction among users to promote explicit (codified) and tacit knowledge flow. It will therefore stimulate the process of innovation within the South African health system.	informatics (discipline);knowledge management	Jacobus Adriaan Louw;Christopher John Seebregts;William Malegapuru Makgoba;Benjamin Fouché	2001	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-928-8-361		AI	-75.01231222255133	-4.5608719720650726	171878

Processes of appropriation and exclusion governing the public space geared by policies intended to increase security must therefore be concurrently informed to address the complexities of social reality. As far as architectural solutions and urban forms are concerned, the pattern of building placement, together with the size of the development and the grain of zoning of the area where it stands, are all major factors on the production of a spatially fit and a socially just hierarchy of territories.

Drawing on a case of Data.gov, we outline the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for the liberation of public data. Data.gov is an online portal that provides open access to datasets generated by US public agencies and countries around the world in a machine-readable format. By discussing the challenges and opportunities faced by Data.gov, we provide several lessons that can inform research and practice. We suggest that providing access to open data in itself does not spur innovation. Specifically, we claim that public agencies need to spend resources to improve the capacities of their organizations to move toward 'open data by default'; develop capacities of community to use data to solve problems; and think critically about the unintended consequences of providing access to public data. We also suggest that public agencies need better metrics to evaluate the success of open-data efforts in achieving its goals.		Rashmi Krishnamurthy;Yukika Awazu	2016	Int J.

73bb1581fef5240dc898c3022c92ee2bc603a156	records management practice: the issues and models for classification	e government;records management;records management model;malaysia;records classification	This paper identifies electronic records management practice with particular reference to Syariah Courts in Malaysia specifying on classification matter. Classification is paramount for a complete records management other than safeguarding vital records upon determining their value for business continuity. Prior to that, a number of records management models were analysed with the aim to identify whether the Syariah Courts hold onto a specific model in executing electronic records management. Model generally takes the form of inputs, processes, and outputs or expected results in a simplified representation of a limited part of reality with related elements. The study adopts a survey method with interview and document content analysis as the techniques in analysing the models. The interview served as a snapshot study with the aim to reveal the issues embraced by the e-Syariah systems namely the Syariah Court Case Management System. Upon analysing the existing models, it was discovered there are flaws in the existing models making them inappropriate for implementation as they are too theoretical in nature. Furthermore, none of the models address on records classification. On the other hand, the interviews depicted that the electronic records management carried out in the Syariah Court is without the adoption of any model. It is due to this fact that the system was developed without taking into consideration the classification function but instead was designed for storage and retrieval purposes only. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In a context that favors open public data (PD), this research analyzes the opportunities provided by these data to HIS. By being provided by governments as part of their missions, DP are characterized by reliability and reusability. Following an empirical approach, we perform a HIS macro classification, based on functional criteria and territorial coverage. We analyze the current supply of health PD issued by the major governmental and transnational platforms, using several criteria (thematic and territorial coverage, volume, format, organization). We correlate this offer to different types of SIS. Finally, we identify the main barriers to be eliminated and the overall trends.

0ad44af0fb1286f9792d368e78cb161d826a2b60	environmental responsibilty and green it: an institutional perspective	institutional theory;environment;green it	A recent Gartner Research report found that environmental concerns are increasingly exercising the minds of business and IT executives. This is reflected in the growing interest in the adoption of environmentally responsible approaches to the deployment, operation and use of IT. However, for the majority of firms, issues of cost reduction and energy efficiency appear to predominate. This paper argues that whether it is an interest in Green IT or in cost reduction, the concerns of business and IT managers are modulated by regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive influences in the institutional environment. The study therefore applies institutional theory to develop a series of theoretical propositions which specify the effect that such influences have in shaping environmental responsibility in organisations. Important as such a theoretical contribution may be, there are, however, the pressing practical imperatives of formulating Green IT strategies, achieving energy efficiencies, and reducing carbon footprints—thus, the study also contributes to a practical understanding of the complex institutional influences at play in shaping such imperatives.	environmental resource management;modulation;noise shaping;software deployment;traffic shaping	Tom Butler;Mary Daly	2009			green computing;environmental economics;computer science;environmental resource management;institutional theory;natural environment;management	HCI	-75.75385517701618	-6.689371854445871	174912

This paper tries to assess one aspect of these claims, looking at whether Internet access appears to affect the export performance of enterprises in low and middle-income economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The papers finds that even after controlling for self-selectivity bias and for factors that might affect both exports and Internet connectivity, enterprises with Internet access appear to export more than similar enterprises without access. Further, Internet access appears to affect industrial and service enterprises to similar degrees.	internet access;selectivity (electronic)	George R. G.

We resort to cluster analysis to identify and characterize main groups of higher education systems in Europe. Using forecasting techniques for the 2014–2020 period, we foresee the dynamics of the previously outlined clusters, and the perspectives of convergence in the near future. We analyse the factors facilitating or inhibiting convergence, and the necessary exchanges between groups of countries which are mostly prone to harmonization. The paper integrates previous studies of the authors regarding European level convergence, bringing together best practices and strategies to achieve convergence not only regionally, but also within the European higher education sector.

7b6d2eb3dbb0d6c6d8f8e9f5ad504d60e48144e8	a conceptual model for the development of a national cybersecurity index: an integrated framework		As ICT and cyberspace become sources of impressive innovation, the reliance of organizations, governments, and people on them will increase. However, with this vast reliance, hazardous vulnerabilities have emerged. These vulnerabilities may be exploited, resulting in information and cybersecurity issues at the national as well as the international levels. Cybersecurity is critical for sustaining resilience in critical infrastructures (CI) as well as information infrastructures (CII). Accordingly, cybersecurity should be incorporated into the economic and national security model of a nation. With this in mind, a cybersecurity index is a necessary tool to compare the performance of nations in terms of cybersecurity initiatives, and in articulating effective cybersecurity policies and strategies. This paper proposes a holistic framework for building a cybersecurity index taking into consideration the technological, legal, economic, cultural, and international relations factors pertinent to countries and paves the way for cybersecurity measures and metrics to be established and tested.	computer security;cyberspace;holism;relevance	Kai S.

Yet too little attention is paid to evaluating these systems. This article draws on data quality scholarship to develop a yardstick that assesses the quality of data breach notification systems in the U.S. at both the state and national levels from the perspective of key stakeholders, who include law enforcement agencies, consumers, shareholders, investors, researchers, and businesses that sell security products. Findings reveal major shortcomings that reduce the value of data breach information to these stakeholders. The study concludes with detailed recommendations for reform. hands, a major identity theft crisis would have been under way. Indeed, security breaches are a leading cause of identity theft, the number one consumer complaint from 2000 to 2010, consisting of 19% of the overall complaints (Federal Trade Commission, 2010, 2011) . Data breaches, moreover, are increasing. Between 2005 and 2009, the number of data breaches in the U.S. rose from 157 to 498 (Identity Theft Resource Center, 2010c). Total annual identity fraud has been rising from $45 in 2007 to $54 billion in 2009 (Javelin Strategy and Research, 2010b). Despite this, however, there is no common yardstick by which to evaluate data breach systems.

Furthermore, groups in the field have begun to develop best practices in areas such as digitization and metadata architecture. However, other areas have been less discussed, namely the organizational and management issues that digital libraries must address. These issues include staffing, collaboration among departments or institutions, budgeting, and the strategies that digital libraries use to ensure long-term sustainability for projects. Panelists in this session will discuss the strategies that they have used to meet the organizational and management needs of their digital library projects.	digital library;library (computing);miles gordon technology	Katherine McNeill-Harman;Elizabeth Roderick;Margret Branschofsky;Caroline Arms	2002		10.1002/meet.1450390182	digital library;computer science;knowledge management;world wide web	EDA	-73.52774589870744	-6.028806240254141	179706

The guest editor wishes to acknowledge the contributions of the authors, reviewers, and discussants which have made the special track a valuable experience for all participants. This introduction gives an overview of the topics addressed and the papers presented. We conclude with a short summary of the group work and discussions which took place. Communities of practice (CoPs) – collocated and virtual ones alike – increasingly attract attention in the business world. Bringing together employees of different organizational units and addressing business relevant topics across organizational units they play an important role for knowledge distribution and evolution within a modern organization. They can be conceptualized as strings of a web which tie organizational units closer to each other, ensure knowledge flow and support the creation of an organizational whole. However, the question about “When, where and how to employ CoPs to serve business goals?” forces an organization to consider and decide upon a number of important trade-offs – which unfortunately often are not made explicit. Examples of such trade-offs are: • knowledge centralization versus knowledge distribution • one common knowledge structure versus diverse knowledge structures • optimized knowledge distribution within one community versus making knowledge readily available to all other employees Making these trade-offs explicit is an important first step to help organizations decide on which knowledge management activities will be effective for reaching the business goals as well as will fit to the organizational culture.	knowledge management;string (computer science)	Stefanie N.

Connecting biobanks, researchers and service providers raises numerous challenges including trust among partners and towards the infrastructure as well as interoperability problems. Therefore we develop a holistic, open-source and easy-to-use IT infrastructure. Our federated approach allows partners to reflect their organizational structures and protect their data sovereignty. The search service and the contact arrangement processes increase data sovereignty without stigmatizing for rejecting a specific cooperation. The infrastructure supports daily processes with an integrated basic sample manager and user-definable electronic case report forms. Interfaces for existing IT systems avoid re-entering of data. Moreover, resource virtualization is supported to make underutilized resources of some partners accessible to those with insufficient equipment for mutual benefit. The functionality of the resulting infrastructure is outlined in a use-case to demonstrate collaboration within a translational research network. Compared to other existing or upcoming infrastructures, our approach has ultimately the same goals, but relies on gentle incentives rather than top-down imposed progress.

However, they have recently become much more capable, due to the arrival of cheap, reliable, and small electronic products that control the flight, collect data and communicate. The use of remotely piloted aircraft systems and unmanned aircraft systems (RPAS/UAS) is booming globally, and in order to integrate its operations routinely and safely into civil airspace, it is necessary to establish standards aligned with International law. Currently, in Ecuador, the issue has been approached in a general way, establishing basic policies that help but do not cover the full spectrum of the operation of these systems. This document provides a proposal for incorporation of norms applicable to the reality of Ecuador to be considered and applied based on international regulatory information from countries that have addressed the issue in greater depth, focusing on security, air traffic, privacy, regulation and socioeconomic impediments. It addresses specific issues and cases, encouraging the reduction of gaps and inconsistencies in the law for the operation of these systems; Anticipating the growing market today and being able to incorporate this technology into civil airspace.	unmanned aerial vehicle	Pablo Fernando Albán Ruiz;Luis Hernán Montoya Lara;António Manuel de Jesús Pereira	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-56541-5_61	international law;airspace class;aeronautics;standardization;air traffic control;computer science;drone	Embedded	-73.40511509434191	-8.72839536112641	180604

The recent growth of ULLs and Human Smart City initiatives is disclosing a promising bridge between the micro-scale of decision and the urban governance mechanisms [17] [18] [4]. In coherence with these perspectives, the paper reports on the interplay between urban governance and smart services co-design in urban transformation as it has been observed and analyses in two European projects, namely Periphèria (www.peripheria.eu) and MyNeinghbourhood (www.my-neighbourhood.eu). It also discusses the value of service co-design as a strategic practice to experiment new participatory governance in smart cities.	image scaling;smart city	Grazia Concilio;Alessandro Deserti;Francesca Rizzo	2014	IxD&A		smart city;management science;environmental resource management;deliberative democracy;citizen journalism;corporate governance;political science	HCI	-70.74502344052719	-3.401161620291532	181564

In an increasingly global environment, these disasters are no longer isolated phenomena and must be responded to with a global perspective. The number of casualties from Indian Ocean Tsunami is a testament to the failure of humans in mitigating large scale emergency incidents and it is the consequence of ineffective information sharing and communication among key stakeholders. Using Activity Theory as the theoretical lens, we explore the communication phenomena in emergency response and we identify the major challenge facing communication practices.

To date, little mainstream KM research is coming through with a security focus. This paper asks why, and proposes that security be integrated into KM success models. The Jennex and Olfman (International Journal of Knowledge Management 2(3):51---68, 2006) KM success model is used to illustrate how security, specifically risk management, and the National Security Telecommunications and Information System Security Committee (NSTISSC) security model can be applied to KM management support and governance and KM Strategy. Finally, two case studies are provided that illustrate the application of risk management through governance to KM.	knowledge management	Murray E.

0887c22d1a0099a539928237fa81acd633ecc666	looking beyond data through the ages		Accessing data has always been crucial in order to get access to (cultural) knowledge. But in the new ages different challenges arise to keep complex data accessible. Concerning these challenges a linguistic use case, which has been set up in 1993, serves as an example to show that it might be hard to re-enact an old system in order to reuse its research data and processes. Re-enacting the old system showed that other crucial points emerge in the context of research data management that need attention. In order to increase the probability of gaining access to research data in the future Data Management Plans can be identified as central tool. Although preservation of and creating access to data is a global task, the scientific management of data is still strongly shaped through national regulations and practices and hence delivers a quite fragmented picture.	case preservation;cloud computing;data center;data curation;digital curation;interconnection;service-level agreement;software repository	Dennis Wehrle;Wiebke van Ekeris;Uli Hahn	2014			computer science;knowledge management;data mining;management science	DB	-75.63824173105166	-5.313240368366072	183143
e8cef134077488d7f91dcff0f8d05622bd244b7f	wisconsin iaims: towards a regional health it architecture		The goal of Wisconsin Health Sciences IAIMS initiative (WI-IAIMS) is to enhance coordination through improved communication while preserving local control of information resources. The proposed aims of the project are to strengthen the organizational, technical and informatics infrastructure to support the health science research, teaching and service needs of the University of Wisconsin. The two-year planning initiative identified that successful solutions for an IAIMS in Wisconsin must adhere to the unique aspects of UW-Madison and state of Wisconsin training and research environment. Therefore, WI-IAIMS will be in line with a management philosophy that endorses local investment and control of information technology resources, educational programs that rely on numerous clinical training sites, and a commitment by the UW Health Science schools to expand research activities to better include and be responsive to the citizens of the state.

Each year, many natural and man-made disasters occur, affecting thousands of people around the globe. During these catastrophes, both, government and humanitarian organizations, face great logistics challenges in which the main objective is to satisfy the needs of people touched by such disaster, to mitigate their suffering. To achieve such objective, an adequate Inventory Management Strategy in these logistics operations plays a crucial role at each echelon of the Supply Chain. This paper also aims to identify the state-of-the-art of Inventory Management Strategies and models used for humanitarian logistics operations as well as commercial models with the special features related to it. It includes its categorization according to crucial criteria and the identification of trends, gaps and challenges in this field, in order to provide valuable insights for future research in this domain.	inventory;logistics	Elma Irais Mora-Ochomogo;Jaime Mora-Vargas;Marco Serrato	2016	IJCOPI		logistics;humanitarian logistics;operations management;management science;business;operations research	Robotics	-73.33060380308099	-7.535130792082019	185217

In this study, we provide a first step towards an ontology of workarounds in order to enable researchers to study the relationships among the core concepts. By identifying existing literature, we discover three gaps in workaround research: (1) lack of conceptual consensus, (2) fragmentation and (3) static perspective. To advance theory, we provide an overview of different types of workarounds that are frequently used in literature. Based on these findings we derive core concepts of workarounds that are used in literature and provide an ontology of workarounds.	coherence (physics);fork (software development);information systems research;information system;systems theory;workaround	Nina Röder;Manuel Wiesche;Michael Schermann;Helmut Krcmar	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.640	shadow system;public relations;computer science;organization;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;marketing;operating system;software engineering;workaround;decoupling;data mining;database;resistance;management;law;world wide web;information system	DB	-76.70570998208089	-3.5290146975816277	186037

In 2010, Penang received almost six million tourist arrivals. In Penang, cultural heritage is the most important tourism attraction especially after Georgetown, the state capital of Penang, was inscribed as a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO in 2008. However, cultural heritage tourism would not be able to achieve sustainable development unless local communities participate in the development process. As such, it has become increasingly important to drive local communities to participate positively in tourism activities under the rapid development of cultural heritage tourism in Penang. In constructing an appropriate community participation model of cultural heritage tourism from the perspective of the innovation system, this research initially reviews the previous studies on community participation in tourism and innovation system, and subsequently analyses the specific characteristics and current situation of cultural heritage tourism by using Penang as an example. Finally, based on the research findings and analysis of secondary data, this article constructs a community participation model of cultural heritage tourism from the perspective of the innovation system.	mathematical model	Huibin Xing;Azizan Marzuki	2012	IJSTM	10.1504/IJSTM.2012.052855	tourism geography;industrial heritage;cultural heritage;environmental resource management;marketing;ecotourism;cultural heritage management;economic growth	HCI	-76.54487870325954	-6.424428786244159	186189

Correspondingly, many organizations such as the HTCIA (High Technology Criminal Investigators Association) and IACIS (International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists) have emphasized disk imaging procedures which ensure reliability, completeness, accuracy, and verifiability of computer disk evidence. The rapidly increasing and changing volume of data within corporate network information systems and personal computers are driving the need to revisit current evidence collection methodologies. These methodologies must evolve to maintain the balance between electronic environmental pressures and legal standards. This paper posits that the current methodology which focuses on collecting entire bit-stream images of original evidence disk is increasing legal and financial risks. The first section frames the debate and change drivers for a Risk Sensitive approach to digital evidence collection, which is followed by the current methods of evidence collection along with a cost-benefit analysis. Then the methodology components of the Risk Sensitive approach to collection, and then concludes with a legal and resource risk assessment of this approach. Anticipated legal arguments are explored and countered, as well. The authors suggest an evolved evidence collection methodology which is more responsive to voluminous data cases while balancing the legal requirements for reliability, completeness, accuracy, and verifiability of evidence.

Our artifact was developed for the Western New York community as part of One Region Forward's planning process, developing a single portal for all stakeholders involved to continue collaborating on the plan. We developed an application that will serve as a forum to allow citizens that are passionate about sustainability to express their ideas to other citizens and plan stakeholders to build capacity and turn their ideas into action. The artifact acts as a multi-sided platform that promotes crowdsourcing for a variety of agents to come together and participate on sustainability related projects.	smart city	Joana Monteiro;Matthew Austin;Gaurav Mandilwar;Raj Sharman	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-18714-3_30	public relations;engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management	HCI	-74.47932898321967	-5.23094572716236	187313
90755073e2dafc287592615f8a9c87687aff68a3	informing the nation: the future of librarianship and government information service	information service	Seventeen years after the U.S. Office of Technology published its seminal report Informing the Nation librarians specializing in government information remain confounded by a tangled knot of federal information policy, library practice, and rapid changes in technology. During the 1990s, a century of bibliographic practice born out of the 1896 Public Printing Act (the genesis of modern government information librarianship) shifted away from print and paper technologies of mass publishers and into a form of distribution and access not at all familiar. If librarians understood they were moving away from something, they were (and in many cases still are) in a struggle to understand where they were going. Electronic government initiatives, changes in right to know and freedom of information laws, the rapid growth of government Web space on the global information network stretch the conceptual outlines of a library; concepts largely unchanged since the earlier global cultural shift to mechanical printing four centuries ago. Further, each report, government study, or technological innovation since the OTA study’s release calls into question many of its fundamental perspectives that argue for an eternal bind between traditional libraries and public bureaucracies in a relationship that gets bdocuments to the people.Q Informing the Nation, along with librarians supportive of its findings, assumed that a centralized system of public information creation and distribution was indifferent to shifts in technology. In brief, this perspective argues that technological innovations have little impact on the legislative or policy foundations of the centralization. Rather, these technological improvements reinforced, for instance, the federal government’s ability to create, distribute (even push) information among a set of long recognized user communities: libraries, citizens (individuals and interest groups), as well as various publishing/information redistribution organizations. Information technology is primarily a means of production, not distribution. Further, many of the OTA report’s recommendations (as do the majority of subsequent reports published since 1988) call for measures that essentially side with the policy argument that this bcentralityQ is best governed by public authorities rather than private market mechanisms.	centralisation;centralized computing;freedom of information laws by country;genesis;librarian;library (computing);printing	John A.

To support the provision and use of open data and to stimulate the realization of these advantages, a variety of open data infrastructures has been released and are under development. The release of these open data infrastructures raises the question how they complement and relate to each other. No systematic analysis of these infrastructures is available. In this paper, a framework for comparing open data infrastructures is derived, and used to compare three different open data infrastructures. The comparison shows that open data infrastructures can be very diverse, differ in their focus resulting in different design choices, and each infrastructure has its own specific strengths. We argue that these open data infrastructures should complement each other by providing open interfaces, in this way stimulating the provision and use of open data and the realization of their advantages. As a consequence, an open ecosystem is created in which the best functionalities can be utilized.	complementarity theory;ecosystem	Anneke Zuiderwijk;Marijn Janssen;Armin Parnia	2013		10.1145/2479724.2479749	engineering;data mining;management science;world wide web	Visualization	-76.4524157860984	-4.473153152570399	187936

However, very little is known about the root cause of data breach incidents; making it difficult for healthcare organizations to establish proper security controls and defenses. Through a systematic review and synthesis of data breaches literature, and using databases of earlier reported healthcare data breaches, the authors re-examine and analyze the causal factors behind healthcare data breaches. The authors then use the Swiss Cheese Model (SCM) to shed light on the technical, organizational and human factors of these breaches. The author’s research suggests that incorporating the SCM concepts into the healthcare security policies and procedures can assist healthcare providers in assessing the vulnerabilities and risks associated with the maintenance and transmission of protected health information.	causality;correlation does not imply causation;data breach;database;human factors and ergonomics;information privacy;protected health information;security controls;swiss cheese model;systematic review;vulnerability (computing)	Faouzi Kamoun;Mathew Nicho	2014	IJHISI	10.4018/ijhisi.2014010103	data breach;computer science;data mining;database;data protection act 1998;computer security	ML	-71.66921408856099	-8.353440578868508	188959

However, a US Army organization was concerned that over time the accumulation of merit raises would make the total payroll unaffordable. We were asked to investigate the conditions under which this situation would be likely to happen. We used the Vensim® modeling software to produce a model of the influences and events that would cause payroll to rise or fall from year to year. Our analysis showed that the merit pay policies in place at the start of our study were very likely to lead to undesirable growth in total pay and a concentration of all employees near the maximum allowed salary, defeating the purpose of NSPS—to reward better service with more pay. The most important factors were the fraction of merit pay that was given as merit raises (as opposed to bonuses) and the salaries of people newly hired to replace those who left the organization. We showed how departing senior employees should be replaced with less-senior ones to avoid long-term payroll growth. We used the model to find the combinations of merit pay and new-hire policies that would balance the effect of these two major influences and produce little or no long-term payroll growth. We also showed that some other influences that had concerned the client were actually of small effect compared to the stochastic uncertainty in payroll growth. Another influence, attrition, produced a more substantial effect. The interactive nature of the model allowed real-time exploration of alternatives with the client and helped build confidence in the robustness of the results. These results highlight potential problem areas needing careful analysis in implementing similar merit pay systems.		Guy C. Huntsinger;Roger Chapman Burk;Timothy E.

However, the growth of cloud computing also goes hand in hand with an increasing demand for energy, caused by a continuously growing demand for content, data-intensive applications and bandwidth. The debates on the energy implications of the substantial shift to cloud computing among industry experts, researchers and civil society organizations mainly focus on stand-alone aspects of this shift, whereas a comprehensive view on the whole system, its inter-relations and driving forces are still rare. In the course of an EU-funded project (www.SCPRESPONDER.eu) the syntax of causal loop diagrams and analytical tools of system dynamics has been used to develop a system map of the diverse effect pathways that a shift to cloud computing may have on energy consumption. The map was developed in an iterative participatory expert consultation process involving 25 experts from industry, research and policymaking. The map allows for integrating different strands of knowledge, shedding light on the dynamics of the whole system and identifying leverage points for business strategies as well as policy interventions. It shows that the effects on overall energy consumption depend on (1) relative strengths of the individual effect pathways which are, inter alia, (2) dependent on energy efficiency gains achieved through a broad diversity of measures in very different areas, while (3) the key drivers of the whole system are economy of scales (through reductions of service cost per unit) and (4) new user needs for data-intensive services. While some experts perceive these dynamics as typical rebound effects (increased efficiency is compensated by growth), others regard them as success strategies for individual businesses and the sector as a whole. Both groups share the view that service reliability, privacy and security of cloud services are the most important leverage points of the whole system. Furthermore, even if, through the growth of data-intensive services, the shift to cloud computing would cause growth of the overall energy consumption, this increase might potentially be off-set by thirdorder effects in the form of savings in the areas of mobility or housing (e.g. teleworking)."""	causal filter;cloud computing;data-intensive computing;diagram;iteration;system dynamics;telecommuting;twelve leverage points;world wide web	Michal Sedlacko;Andre Martinuzzi;Karin Dobernig	2014		10.2991/ict4s-14.2014.11	simulation;engineering;operations management;management science;utility computing	HPC	-76.3034845506235	-5.806512484452639	189249

Official documents exchange via microblogging (ODEM) in the Bureau of Justice, Haining is a practice case of government information open in the new media. For analyzing the determinants from academic perspective and exploring the managerial value of the case, the paper report an exploratory case study based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. After several field interviews and rigorous data coding by following the case study methodology, we find that top manager’s support, personnel’s IT accomplishment, and regional economic and social environment are the key determinants of the emergence of ODEM, as well as the organizational structure and operational flow is not change immediately in this case. The limitation and future goals of the study are also discussed in the paper.	emergence;internet;new media;web 2.0	Nan Zhang;Zhongwen Zhang;Qingguo Meng	2013			public relations;advertising;world wide web	Web+IR	-75.42988623207275	-6.007906100871623	190430

But politics can also shape technology indirectly, through the construction of legal, regulatory, or economic structures by forming a landscape that can discourage technological change in certain directions and encourage it in others. Of course, such structures do not come from nowhere; they are themselves the residue of earlier political choices. Nevertheless, they can affect technological change in ways unintended, or at least unimagined, at the time of their creation.

cd664d9720675276882dc59ec8771ca2727c4ea9	on the security of international data exchange services for e-governance systems		The effects of globalisation and information welfare combined with the increasing mobility of individuals lead to a number of challenges to modern states. In order to guarantee a smooth, secure, uninterrupted organisational flow, governments and their subsidiaries need to cooperate and exchange data on individuals and organisations across national borders. However, insufficiently secured communication of such data imposes security threats which may endanger the individual’s privacy. Currently, several states within Europe develop and operate e-governance systems. These are primarily designed to allow the exchange of data within the institutions of one state. However, examples such as the Estonian e-governance backbone system X-Road strive towards an EU-wide expansion. Technical solutions for the transnational exchange of data between governmental institutions are an unavoidable part of the future of cyberspace. Despite the fact that EU specifications exist, the discrepancy between specification and implementation becomes immanent. This article explores some of the general aspects of the design of secure transnational data exchange frameworks. A comparative analysis of existing e-governance systems within Europe is given based on defined security aspects. It is explored how decisions made in the design may affect the security of the underlying network and its components. The challenges of transnational data exchange frameworks are discussed.	cyberspace;discrepancy function;e-governance;internet backbone;qualitative comparative analysis;system x (computing);traffic enforcement camera	Kim Hartmann;Christoph Steup	2015	Datenschutz und Datensicherheit - DuD	10.1007/s11623-015-0452-2	computer security	Security	-73.63910511751425	-8.359665660254143	190562

The risks of information security breach, data loss, and disaster are growing. The impact of IT outages and issues on the company are unacceptable to any size business and their clients. There are many ways to address the security for IT departments. The need to address risks of attacks as well as disasters is important to the IT security policies and procedures. The IT departments of small to medium companies have to address these security concerns within their budgets and other limited resources.Security planning, design, and employee training that is needed requires input and agreement from all levels of the company and management.

Consequently, a lot of investments are made to improve disruption management. Much has already been written about disruption management, often with the purpose of supporting operators in their decision making. However, to the best of our knowledge, this literature doesnu0027t consider the structural differences of disruption management in different countries. An overview of the various ways in which disruptions are solved and conditions under which that happens could help rail infrastructure managers and train operating companies to reconsider the ways in which they operate. This paper takes stock of the similarities and differences in how disruptions are managed in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Of importance is not only how these systems work on paper, but above all what happens in practice, i.e. the habits and routines that operators have developed for solving disruptions.	denial-of-service attack	Danny Schipper;Lasse Gerrits	2018	JRTPM	10.1016/j.jrtpm.2017.12.003	operator (computer programming);environmental resource management;business	HCI	-74.97037089794073	-7.216590805707757	192635

The seizure of Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and creation of images of entire disk drives have become a best practice by law enforcement agencies. In most criminal cases, however, the incriminatory information found on an HDD is only a small portion of the entire HDD and the remaining information is not relevant to the case. For this reason, demands for the regulation of excessive search and seizure of defendants' innocuous information have been increasing and gaining strength. Some courts have even ruled out inadmissible digital evidence gathered from sites where the scope of a warrant has been exceeded, considering it to be a violation of due process. In order to protect the privacy of suspects, a standard should be made restricting excessive search and seizure. There are, however, many difficulties in selectively identifying and collecting digital evidence at a crime scene, and it is not realistic to expect law enforcement officers to search and collect completely only case-relevant evidence. Too much restriction can cause severe problems in investigations and may result in law enforcement authorities missing crucial evidence. Therefore, a model needs to be established that can assess and regulate excessive search and seizure of digital evidence in accordance with a reasonable standard that considers practical limitations. Consequently, we propose a new approach that balances two conflicting values: human rights protection versus the achievement of effective investigations. In this new approach, a triage model is derived from an assessment of the limiting factors of on-site search and seizure. For the assessment, a survey that provides information about the level of law enforcement, such as the available labor, equipment supply, technical limitations, and time constraints, was conducted using current field officers. A triage model that can meet the legal system's demand for privacy protection and which supports decision making by field officers that can have legal effects was implemented. Since the demands of each legal system and situation of law enforcement vary from country to country, the triage model should be established individually for each legal system. Along with experiment of our proposed approach, this paper presents a new triage model that is designed to meet the recent requirements of the Korean legal system for privacy protection from, specifically, a Korean perspective.

60509cb05b47eb4582453478c4f65bf9ccf18060	a web-enabled geovisual analytics tool applied to oecd regional data		Recent advances in web-enabled graphics technologies have the potential to make a dramatic impact on developing highly interactive Geovisual Analytics applications for the Internet. An emerging and challenging application domain is geovisualization of regional (sub-national) statistics. Higher integration driven by institutional processes and economic globalisation is eroding national borders and creating competition along regional lines in the world market. Sound information at sub-national level and benchmarking of regions across countries, therefore, has increased in importance in the policy agenda of many countries. In this paper, we introduce “OECD eXplorer” – an interactive tool for analyzing and communicating gained insights and discoveries about spatial-temporal and multivariate OECD regional data. This database is a potential treasure chest for policy-makers, researchers and citizens to gain a better understanding of a region’s structure and performance and to carry out analysis of territorial trends and disparities based on sound information comparable across countries. Many approaches and tools have been developed in spatial-related knowledge discovery but generally they do not scale well with dynamic visualization of larger spatial data on the Internet. In this context, we introduce a web-compliant Geovisual Analytics toolkit that supports a broad collection of functional components for analysis and validation, hypothesis generation, communicating and finally collaborating gained insights and knowledge based on a snapshot mechanism that captures, re-uses and shares task-related explorative events. An important ambition is to develop a generic highly interactive web “eXplorer” platform that can be the foundation for easy customization of similar dynamic web applications using different geographical boundaries and indicators and be publicly available. Given this global dimension, the dream of building a repository “statistical Wiki” of progress indicators, where experts and public users can use these generic tools to compare situations for two or more countries, regions or local communities, could be accomplished.	application domain;geovisualization;graphics;internet;progress indicator;snapshot (computer storage);web analytics;web application;wiki	Mikael Jern;Monica Brezzi;Lars Thygesen	2009		10.2312/ega.20091004	simulation;engineering;data science;data mining	Visualization	-74.57057740508418	-4.539903374621024	193498

In the absence of worldwide public health standards-based networks, the ability to monitor and respond quickly to such outbreaks is limited. In order to tackle such threats, IBM Haifa Research Lab and IBM Almaden Research Lab developed a PHAD implementation which consists of an information technology infrastructure for the public health community leveraging the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative and important standards. This system enables sharing of data generated at clinical and public health institutions across proprietary systems and political borders. The ability to share public health data electronically paves the way for sophisticated and advanced analysis tools to visualize the population health, detect outbreaks, determine the effectiveness of policy, and perform forecast modeling.	affinity analysis	Boaz Carmeli;Tzilla Eshel;Daniel K.

However, with surging demand for RPA combat operations, the United States Air Force (USAF) has struggled to train and retain sufficient manpower to operate these aircraft. As part of a recent effort by the Secretary of Defense to stabilize manpower trends in the USAF RPA enterprise, we developed a dynamic manpower projection model to quantify the potential impact of more than 50 policy initiatives. Ultimately, the model showed that a combination of five major policy initiatives would most efficiently and expeditiously improve manpower trends. The Air Force has already begun to implement these initiatives as part of a plan that will affect over 1,100 active-duty airmen operating a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

Most innovation studies about Chinese business are based on Chinese policy and government programmes and their results. This special issue of Technology Analysis and Strategic Management explores China’s indigenous innovation strategy and suggests a research agenda that focuses on Chinese innovation theory building that incorporates China’s efforts to move towards an innovation-based economy. Currently, China is developing its indigenous innovation capabilities (The Chinese term is , pronounced zizhu chuangxin). We suggest that innovation studies of Chinese business could focus on these indigenous innovation ambitions. In addition to this, it could adopt, and be embedded in a Chinese theory of innovation instead of a traditional Western-centric theory of innovation. Our proposition is that to better understand Chinese indigenous innovation, a new paradigm of Chinese innovation should be developed. We therefore present a research agenda that can be a starting point for the development of such a theory, and present seven papers in this special issue that give content to this idea. Obviously no theory will have a monopoly on exploring Chinese innovation phenomena, but it is interesting to add a Chinese-centric view into the Western-centric scholarly view. We hope that will be one of the contributions of this special issue on innovation in China.	chinese room;embedded system;emergence;monopoly;programming paradigm;strategic management	Tsvi Vinig;Bart Bossink	2015	Techn.

Child labour is one such issue that is currently impacting children in the Democratic Republic of Congo as they mine for coltan. This conflict mineral is used in many consumer electronics, which raises the issue of what consumers and companies are doing to take action against this issue. This study uses the issue of child labour to mine coltan for cell phones to assess the ethical impact on consumers of the cell phone industry. Consumer awareness leads to an assessment of revised social features (Auger et al., 2003), which looks at the existence of price premiums and purchase intentions. The willingness-to-pay for social features leads to ethical consumerism, which positively reinforces the continued focus on corporate responsibility among businesses. Survey results analysing the issue are used to show that consumers identify child labour as socially unjust and consumers are willing to pay more for phones that can be certified as child labour-free.	knox mine disaster;mobile phone	Emily K.

First of all, you’ll face high costs. These wide-scaled investments have always been carried out causing the state budget to bear big shares. However, it’s not only the financial aspect. Transportation has a dynamic build and has multidimensional effects. The social characteristics of society, urbanisation, environmental conditions, energy supply, political balance; are all major factors to be consideredand that affect the solution of transport. In other words, there is a mutual influence. As much as the content and importance increase, these mutual influences enlarge more and more. Thus, while deciding on investments, these dynamic mutual influences must be taken into account as much as the capacity that will be gained. It’s vital to choose the most suitable and useful investment according to the countries’ conditions and economy, in short, deciding to make the best investment. The decision-making mechanism to invest is generally under control of political office. But this power is emphatically advised to consult with scientific bodies. It is obvious that consulting experts and scientists while making a decision on transport investments will be very positive and contemporary.	decision support system	Nurbanu Caliskan	2006	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2005.02.035	inversion;analytic hierarchy process;decision support system;cognitive map;investment;computer science;operations management;operations research;analytic network process	AI	-75.00692906482261	-9.82294155265752	196470

Using post-event reviews, we classify the lessons learned in three areas: response timeliness, communication and coordination, and technological infrastructure. For each of the two developed nations, this post-event analysis helps identify their structural and operational weaknesses and their (in)abilities to set up an effective crisis management system for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR).

It is also a vital tool for maintaining bibliographic control at both the national and the international level. Hence, there is an international convention to establish a legal deposit system that works under legislative arrangements. However, a legal deposit law does not always guarantee a full implementation. The fact is, unless coordination and cooperation are provided between stakeholders, implementation of legal deposit cannot be effective. This paper, taking Turkey as an example, attempts to examine the problems concerning implementation of legal deposit and proposes solutions in this context. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Securing knowledge assets is important given the current economic, social, and political conditions, such as the surge in terrorist and industrial espionage activities. The problem of managing knowledge security gets compounded when we have to work in a distributed and heterogeneous setting. While private sector organizations have long taken knowledge security for granted, this is not the case in the intelligence and defense sectors of the government, especially those involved with issues of national security. In this paper, we will draw on key insights from investigating knowledge security protocols in five such organizations. Our findings provide insights on how private organizations should secure their most valuable resource - """"knowledge""""."""	knowledge management	Kevin C. Desouza;Ganesh K.
