Three-person teams wrote term papers in one of three conditions: face-to-face (FTF), synchronous computer-mediated communication (Netmeeting), or email. The participants were given 6 weeks to complete the task. Product differences showed only that email groups produced shorter rough drafts than FTF groups, indicating the rough draft was not as well thought out in the email groups. Process measures demonstrated that, overall, communication styles that afforded interactivity were utilized effectively in a collaborative writing setting. Furthermore, lack of expressiveness did not appear to deter groupwork. The results suggest that email alone may not be an appropriate setting for writing collaboratively; whereas teams in a synchronous computer-mediated communication setting, such as Netmeeting, should be able to produce quality work satisfactorily.	computer-mediated communication	Ami L.

In a series of experiments featuring naturalistic concepts (psychology concepts) and naïve learners, we extend previous research by showing that the sequence of study changes the representation the learner creates of the study materials. Interleaved study leads to the creation of relatively interrelated concepts that are represented by contrast to each other and based on discriminating properties. Blocked study, instead, leads to the creation of relatively isolated concepts that are represented in terms of their central and characteristic properties. The relative benefits of these representations depend on whether the test of conceptual knowledge requires contrastive or characteristic information. These results argue for the integrated investigation of the benefits of different sequences of study as depending on the characteristics of the study and testing situation as a whole.	experiment;naivety	Paulo F.

When used in the evaluation process as a tool to assess learning they have obvious benefits by allowing students to externalize their own mental trees of assimilated concepts seamlessly. However, the assessment of concept maps includes a strong degree of subjectiveness, which should be mitigated. In this paper we propose partitioning the concept map evaluation process according to the steps followed for creating them, along with objective metrics to assign a score to each of these steps. We also propose a formula that combines the partial scores to obtain the final score. Afterward we validate the proposed methodology, showing that the score variability associated with the evaluator is reduced by up to 23%.	concept map;interpreter (computing);spatial variability;theory	Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Juan-Carlos Cano;Pietro Manzoni	2009	2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2009.12	concept map;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;database	Robotics	-76.57253259762624	-46.22073987158806	184069

However, in many situations there is not a clear path on the data mining procedures that lead to solid conclusions. Therefore, many studies result in ad-hoc conclusions with insufficient generalization capabilities. In this article, we describe a methodology and report our findings in an experiment which one online course which involved more than 150 students. We used the Moodle LMS during the period of one academic semester, collecting all the interactions between the students and the system. These data scales up to more than 33K records of interactions where we applied data mining tools following the procedure for data extraction, cleaning, feature identification and preparation. We then proceeded to the creation of automatic learning models based on decision trees, we assessed the models and validate the results by assessing the accuracy of the predictions using traditional metrics and draw our conclusions on the validity of the process and possible alternatives1.	data mining;decision tree;hoc (programming language);interaction;plasma cleaning	Álvaro Figueira	2017		10.1145/3144826.3145394	data science;data extraction;data mining;decision tree;engineering;learning management	ML	-76.88288883598221	-50.256967170426925	184262

In this work, we experimentally examine the assumption underlying these works, namely that the human-given reward is compatible with the traditional RL reward signal. We describe an experimental platform with a simulated RL robot and present an analysis of real-time human teaching behavior found in a study in which untrained subjects taught the robot to perform a new task. We report three main observations on how people administer feedback when teaching a robot a task through Reinforcement Learning: (a) they use the reward channel not only for feedback, but also for future-directed guidance; (b) they have a positive bias to their feedback — possibly using the signal as a motivational channel; and (c) they change their behavior as they develop a mental model of the robotic learner. Given this, we made specific modifications to the simulated RL robot, and analyzed and evaluated its learning behavior in four additional experiments with human trainers. We report significant improvements on several learning measures. This work demonstrates the importance of understanding the human-teacher/robot-learner partnership in order to design algorithms that support how people want to teach while simultaneously improving the robot’s learning behavior.	algorithm;emoticon;experiment;mental model;real-time clock;reinforcement learning;robot;software agent	Andrea Lockerd Thomaz;Cynthia Breazeal	2008	Artif.

Version 1 of the agent was able to detect and respond to user affect, but it responded too quickly and too frequently. The second version of the agent featured new student models for detecting and responding to student affective states, which is less sensitive compared to the first version. We conducted a field test with students to determine its effect on learning and learning experience in comparison to using Aplusix alone and Aplusix with the version 1 agent. Results show that version 2 provided significantly fewer interventions to engaged students, more evaluations of engagement, fewer evaluations of boredom, and was generally preferred over version 1.	dialog system;embodied agent;sensor	Thor Collin S.

Temperament style is seen as the combination of qualities which constitute the natural disposition of an individual and which affect actions, thinking and emotions. The DISC model, as adapted by Boyd [Boyd, C. F. (1994). Different children, different needs: the art of adjustable parenting. Oregon: Questar Publishers Inc.], views people as behaving along two orthogonal dimensions: the speed at which a person moves through life, and his/her general focus when doing things, i.e. on people or on tasks. This study proved that both of these dimensions have an influence on the performance of students in a computer programming course while one of them also has an influence on a student’s choice to pursue a programming course. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Discretionary users of computers, such as lawyers, executives, administrators and professors have been ignored. Using techniques of process analysis, this study investigated the characteristics of discretionary users by observing their interaction with commercial word-processing software. Their performance was compared to groups of novices and experts. Results indicate that discretionary users exhibit expert-like characteristics on a small set of routine editing tasks, beyond which their behavior is quite novice-like. A procedural model that indicates areas where software design could improve the editing performance of discretionary users is also discussed.

7296d73b8f0a7626d86a9a598d3d85a81ffad97f	learning to teach with a reinforcement learning agent	reinforcement learning	"""Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) use artificial intelligence techniques to customize their instruction to fit the needs of each student. To do this, the system must have knowledge of the student being taught (commonly called a student model) and a set of pedagogical rules that enable the system to follow good teaching principles. Teaching rules are commonly represented as a set of """"if-then"""" production rules, where the """"if"""" side is dependent on the student model, and the """"then"""" side is a teaching action. For example, a rule may be of the form """"IF (the student has never been introduced to the current topic) THEN (teach the topic to the student)."""" This approach is fairly straightforward from a knowledge engineering perspective, but has many drawbacks. First, there are many such rules, and it is very expensive to encode all of the rules the system will require to teach effectively. Second, it is difficult to incorporate knowledge that human tutors do not use themselves, since expert teachers cannot describe how the system should reason with such knowledge. Since machine tutors have a very different set of data available than human tutors (keystroke latencies, performance on a similar problem 3 weeks ago, etc.), knowledge that could dramatically improve the tutor’s performance must be ignored. We will use Reinforcement learning (RL) to train ITS to teach. RL is a mechanism that allows a machine learning (ML) agent to learn given only a description of the state and a reward for its performance. Thus RL supports unsupervised learning as it does not need to be told what the correct action is, but simply learns how to maximize its long term reward. We will use the student model as a state description for the RL-agent. This saves considerable knowledge engineering work. Also, since the student model already accounts for student learning, the learning task becomes stationary. That is, for a given set of inputs the expected value will remain constant. The agent uses this state description as input to a function approximator, and uses this learned function to select a teaching action. After the selected action is performed, the system examines how the student performs on future problems to compute the effectiveness of the teaching action. If the teaching action was effective, student performance"""	artificial intelligence;encode;event (computing);human–computer interaction;knowledge engineering;machine learning;production (computer science);reinforcement learning;stationary process;unsupervised learning	Joseph E.

d0f46b4b634e2faaf83766e8c965a41a4a396a8b	optimal weighting for exam composition		A problem faced by many instructors is that of designing exams that accurately assess the abilities of the students. Typically these exams are prepared several days in advance, and generic question scores are used based on rough approximation of the question difficulty and length. For example, for a recent class taught by the author, there were 30 multiple choice questions worth 3 points, 15 true/false with explanation questions worth 4 points, and 5 analytical exercises worth 10 points. We describe a novel framework where algorithms from machine learning are used to modify the exam question weights in order to optimize the exam scores, using the overall class grade as a proxy for a student’s true ability. We show that significant error reduction can be obtained by our approach over standard weighting schemes, and we make several new observations regarding the properties of the “good” and “bad” exam questions that can have impact on the design of improved future evaluation methods.	approximation algorithm;final exam;machine learning;mean squared error	Sam Ganzfried;Farzana Yusuf	2017	CoRR		statistics;mathematics education;supervised learning;multiple choice;regression analysis;psychology;linear regression;collaborative learning;composition (visual arts);objective test;weighting	ML	-75.79358891628536	-48.15059704081939	190967

To the traditional scenario where students interact primarily with a single coach or tutor character on-screen, we introduce the addition of both a social, animate colearner, and the student’s own avatar character. Variations of the colearner’s attributes, informed by research literature on human partners, are explored through an online testbed application of English language idioms. Results from an experimental study with 76 Japanese college students reveal that cooperative colearners have a positive impact on students’ performance and experience, as well as increasing perceptions of the character’s intelligence and credibility. Findings provide grounding for a fruitful new direction for pedagogical characters, where students learn alongside emotional companions.	brendan kehoe;cooperative mimo;dyadic transformation;emulator;experiment;interaction;lester the unlikely;natural language processing;population;programming paradigm;scientific literature;self-replicating machine;testbed	Heidy Maldonado;Jong-Eun Roselyn Lee;Scott Brave;Clifford Nass;Hiroshi Nakajima;Ryota Yamada;Kimihiko Iwamura;Yasunori Morishima	2005			psychology;language acquisition;multimedia;communication;pedagogy	HCI	-71.0774400735869	-47.4737912985614	193179

Based on theory of planned behaviour approach, this research intends to investigate the behaviour of using search engines as a learning tool. After factor analysis, the results suggest that perceived satisfaction of search engine, search engines as an information retrieval tool, and sharing search experience and information are three significant factors to affect individual behavioural intention to use search engines as a learning tool. In addition, the research elaborates that individual Internet and search engine experiences will affect these three factors. Moreover, the result also offers evidence that today's computers are popular for the application of communication and information retrieval.	web search engine	Shu-Sheng Liaw	2004	J. Comp.

Research approach -- Thirty-seven psychology students, with no/little formal design training took part in a computer-based experiment wherein they completed three timetabling designs. Tasks varied in the number of external constraints implemented by varying the number of rules applicable to each task. Performance measures included number of successful class placements, task completion times and number of constraint violations during problem solving.  Findings -- The results suggest that having a greater number of rules/constraints is associated with poorer design performance.  Originality/Value -- The research provides some initial quantitative evidence in an area of design problem solving, specifically constraint satisfaction, in which there is a shortage of human-centred research.

We compared the quality of the collaborative process and the joint solution of interdisciplinary dyads of different expertise levels (advanced students, trainees, and experts) working on a patient case. To assess the quality of the collaborative process, a rating scheme developed by Meier et al. (in press) was used. Additionally, process log files measuring individual and joint time and number of work phases were gathered, and joint solutions were analyzed. As had been assumed, the experts scored lower than the less experienced dyads in most measures of collaborative process. Looking in more detail at the less experienced dyads revealed that the trainee dyads outperformed the student dyads in most of the process variables. Analyses of process logfiles revealed the same pattern regarding the number of phases used. The predictions for the quality of the joint solution were more difficult and the results for these variables more mixed.

We examined the impact of working memory load and expected button-to-action mapping congruency on affordances and conventions. The findings suggest both sides of the debate are correct. Learned conventions were found to structure responses towards expected actions, just like affordances, but affordance-based interactions were not affected by memory load while convention-based actions were. Therefore, designers ought to employ perceptual affordances when possible and when not feasible they ought to reuse established conventions. Additionally, evidence is presented that violating expected affordance-based and convention-based button-to-action mappings caused a similar performance cost. We believe that after the initial learning period, conventions play a critical role in the perception of a design’s available actions just as perceptual affordances do.

This method is based on observations of human tutors coaching students in on-line learning tasks. It takes into account the focus of attention of the learner, the learner's current task, and expected time required to perform the task. A Bayesian network model combines evidence from eye gaze and interface actions to infer learner focus of attention. The attention model is combined with a plan recognizer to detect different types of learner difficulties such as confusion and indecision which warrant intervention. We plan to incorporate this capability into a pedagogical agent able to interact with learners in socially appropriate ways.	average-case complexity;bayesian network;finite-state machine;network model;online and offline;online machine learning;pedagogical agent	Lei Qu;Ning Wang;W.

0943dfa93f26e7961c8a18d1db10da40907add14	application of time decay functions and the elo system in student modeling		One of the key aspects of educational data mining is estimation of student skills. This estimation is complicated by the fact that students skills change during the use of an educational system. In this work we study two flexible approaches to skill estimation: time decay functions and the Elo rating system. Results of experiments in several different settings show that these simple approaches provide good and consistent performance. We argue that since these approaches have several pragmatical advantages (flexibility, speed, ease of application) they should be considered in educational data mining at least as a baseline approach.	baseline (configuration management);educational data mining;experiment;sports rating system	Radek Pelánek	2014			machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;adaptive learning;educational data mining	ML	-74.92750528183957	-47.02518713919014	196901

Although this definition prescribes the knowledge ontologies learners need, it is not clear that these forms of knowledge are sufficient to characterize the variance observed in students' scores on conceptual post-test scores. More recently, there has been interest within the intelligent tutoring community in obtaining data on important student characteristics in order to better explain the variance observed in conceptual learning scores.	microworlds	Janice D.

However, little research has been done to examine the contributions of different types of computer experience to computer performance at different time points. The present study compared the effects of four types of computer experience on 30 graduate students learning of a statistical program over one semester. Among the four types of computer experience, students earlier experience of using computer network systems was found to affect their initial performance of learning the statistics program, but the experience of using statistical programs, the experience of email programs, and the length of using computers did not. These findings suggest complex relationships between students computer experience and their computer performance and have implications for both learning and teaching computer programs and understanding the transfer of learning. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

BACKGROUND Important determinants of the effectiveness of instructions are type of instructions (procedural information, principles, and examples) and pedagogical goal (initial performance, learning, and transfer).   METHOD Procedural instructions describe how to complete tasks in a stepwise manner, principles describe rules governing the tasks, and examples demonstrate how instances of the task are carried out. The authors review the research literature associated with each type of instruction to identify factors determining effectiveness for different pedagogical goals.   RESULTS The results suggest a trade-off between usability and learnability. Specific instructions help initial performance, whereas more general instructions, requiring problem solving, help learning and transfer. Learning from instructions takes cognitive effort, and research suggests that learners typically opt for low effort. However, it is possible to meet both goals of good initial performance and learning with methods such as fading and by combining different types of instructions.   CONCLUSION How instructions are constructed influences their effectiveness for the goals of good initial performance, learning, and transfer, and it is therefore important for researchers and practitioners alike to define the pedagogical goal of instructions.   APPLICATION If the goal is good initial performance, then instructions should highly resemble the task at hand (e.g., in the form of detailed procedural instructions and examples), but if the goal is good learning and transfer, then instructions should be more abstract, inducing learners to expend the necessary cognitive effort for learning.

The concept of presence, usually defined as the sense of being inside the virtual environment, has been considered the principal mechanism that leads to the experience of anxiety in clinical virtual environments. The present study sought to examine the relationship between sense of presence and in-session anxiety in a sample of 210 students showing high and low test anxiety when exposed to both clinical and non-stressful virtual environments. This is the largest study conducted to date with the aim of examining the relationship between presence and anxiety in clinical virtual environments, and the first to explore separately the relationship between presence and state-anxiety in phobic and non-phobic participants. The results suggest that presence was not related to anxiety in a non-stressful environment. It was also found that although presence is related to anxiety in both groups of students when exposed to clinical virtual environments, this relationship was clearly stronger for high test anxiety students. This line of research will broaden our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the efficacy of VRET. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We evaluate anonymization techniques achieving the intended protection, while retaining the utility of the anonymized data. The released data could help infer behaviors and subsequently find solutions for daily planning activities, such as cafeteria attendance, cleaning schedules or student performance, or study interaction patterns among an academic population. However, the nature of the academic data is such that many implicit social interaction networks can be derived from the anonymized datasets, raising the need for researching how anonymity can be assessed in this setting.	data anonymization;interaction network;plasma cleaning;privacy	Mário J.

A recent study implied that novice users’ training needs exclusively relate to locating websites. The present case study tried to reveal the knowledge and skills that constitute these training needs. Fourteen pre-university students, classified as novice (n = 7) or experienced WWW-user ( n = 7) performed three web search tasks. Their actions and verbalisations were recorded. Between-group comparisons showed minimal performance differences. However, qualitative analyses of novice users’ search performance suggest that their ability to locate websites could be enhanced by instructing monitoring skills and advanced system knowledge.	www;web search engine	Ard W.

c2edccd0a1a50e0c2fae83938215e0f2494b30bd	computer-assisted grammar practice for oral communication	article in monograph or in proceedings	Gaining the ability to speak proficiently is an important goal in second language learning, and grammatical correctness is an important dimension of oral proficiency. To acquire the ability to produce grammatically correct speech in everyday conversational situations, learners must practice producing speech until they can do so with little to no concious effort. For maximum pedagogical effectiveness, practice exercises should challenge learners to produce spoken output and provide corrective feedback (CF) on their productions so that learners may notice and correct their mistakes. In this paper, we survey the field of Intelligent Computerassisted Language Learning (ICALL) to examine the extent to which current offerings meet the pedagogical requirements for training grammatical accuracy in oral communication. Our analysis shows that few grammarfocused systems support oral practice, and that systems which do offer oral practice tend to train conversational fluency. In response to these findings, we present our position that grammar accuracy should be addressed in ICALL systems and that, in spite of technological limitations, it is possible to deploy speech technology in ICALL systems to support spoken interaction and allow individualized oral grammar practice and feedback.	consciousness;correctness (computer science);pedagogical agent;requirement;speech technology	Stephen Bodnar;Catia Cucchiarini;Helmer Strik	2011			computer science;cognitive science	HCI	-71.3988471781572	-47.6826523630154	199536

There were significant differences in performance by condition on individual items. For an item that proved to be difficult for all of the students on the pretest, an ANOVA showed that scaffolding helped significantly (p < 0.01). We speculated that the scaffolding had a greater positive effect on learning for this item because it was much more difficult for the students than the other items. We thought that this result warranted a closer look at the link between the difficulty of an item and the effectiveness of scaffolding. In this paper, we report on an experiment that examines the effect of math proficiency and the level of interaction on learning. We found an interesting interaction between the level of interaction and math proficiency where less-proficient students benefited from more tutor interaction and more-proficient students benefited from less interaction.	scaffold (programming)	Leena M.

This project aims to experimentally investigate aspects of the propensity to share information online, with a specific focus on the system-induced status of information. Is a simple manipulation of the cognitive status of information sufficient to gain changes in sharing levels? A simple computerized game was used to simulate business decision situations that required participants to use information, and enabled sharing it. . Our hypotheses compared the willingness to share under different conditions of system-induced ownership of information. Participants’ perception of information source and ownership was the independent variable. Sharing was higher for privately owned expertise than it was for organizationally owned content. Ownership makes a difference. It serves to increase sharing of information. Ownership can and should be framed by system design.	experiment;information source;simulation;systems design	Daphne Ruth Raban;Sheizaf Rafaeli	2007	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2006.03.013	psychology;simulation;social psychology;social perception;systems design	HCI	-71.88109408250381	-50.28178714619275	199994
