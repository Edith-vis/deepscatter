fda6c9407abfcf4f2b588e476c1569314e463616	intellectual property law compliance in europe: illegal file sharing and the role of social norms	juridik och samhalle;social norms;intellectual property;ipr enforcement directive;sociology of law;copyright;enforcement;law;law and society;internet;file sharing	The current study empirically demonstrates the widely discussed gap between copyright law and social norms. Theoretically founded in the sociology of law, the study uses a well-defined concept of norms to quantitatively measure changes in the strength of social norms before and after the implementation of legislation. The ‘IPRED law’ was implemented in Sweden on 1 April 2009, as a result of the EU IPR Enforcement Directive 2004/48/EC. It aims at enforcing copyright, as well as other IP rights, when they are violated, especially online. A survey was conducted three months before the IPRED law came into force, and it was repeated six months later. The approximately one thousand respondents between fifteen and twenty-five years-of-age showed, among other things, that although actual file-sharing behaviour had to some extent decreased in frequency, social norms remained unaffected by the law.

Infringement of copyright law on peer-to-peer networks has been expanding rapidly according to S. Sen and J. Wang (2002) and S. Saroiu et al. (2002) making it nearly impossible to get an accurate estimate of the amount of pirated materials that are being transmitted. The current Japanese Diet amended the compensation law, making it possible to calculate compensation based on the quantity of illegally transmitted material (received duplication). However, the means in which to determine the exact quantity is yet to be determined. What is the amount of illegally copied material necessary to dent production incentives? What is the price society has to pay to minimize the spread of illegally copied works? These questions need to be answered to come up with a plausible policy regarding pirated works. Based on the context presented above, the analysis presented in this paper focus on determining the reality of digital copyright infringement, as well as creating and analyzing a model that defines this reality.	internet;peer-to-peer	Yoichiro Itakura;Makoto Yokozawa;Takeshi Shinohara	2004	2004 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops. 2004 Workshops.	10.1109/SAINTW.2004.1268570	the internet;telecommunications;computer science;database;internet privacy;law;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Theory	-70.78111167893405	-11.31318440283498	158880

However, existing research results are confined to the unilateral action of taxpayers, neglect the interaction between the tax declaration and taxation inspection. This paper, from an optimal tax administration perspective, builds a general equilibrium model, in which, taxation inspection cost, net tax revenue and taxpayers personal expected utility maximization, are included, to analyze the interaction between the tax declaration and taxation inspection. Then it proposes some policies and proposals about taxation inspection.	declaration (computer programming);evasion (network security);expectation–maximization algorithm;expected utility hypothesis	Bing Liu	2011	JCP	10.4304/jcp.6.9.1799-1804	ad valorem tax;tax revenue;double taxation;state income tax;tax law;tax avoidance;tax credit;direct tax;value-added tax;deferred tax;tax basis;tax deferral;tax deduction;gross income;indirect tax;tax reform;international taxation	AI	-70.41570596656065	-10.251864433524005	159227

While this trend creates opportunities both for individuals and for society, it also creates risks, due to the data’s personal and often sensitive nature. Countering these risks, while keeping the benefits of QS services, is a task both for the legal system and for the technical community. However, it should also take users’ expectations into account. We therefore analyze the legal situation of QS services based on European law and the privacy policies of some major service providers to clarify the practical consequences for users. We present the result of a study concerning the users’ views on privacy, revealing a conflict between the user’s expectations and the providers’ practices. To help resolve the conflict, we discuss how existing and future privacy-enhancing technologies can avoid the risks associated with QS services.

This paper discusses the concepts of communities of practice and epistemic cultures, and their implication for design of digital libraries that support data sharing, with particular reference to practices of trust and credibility. It uses an empirical study of a biodiversity digital library of data from a variety of sources to illustrate implications digital library design and operation. It concludes that diversity and uncomfortable boundary areas typify, not only digital library user groups, but the design and operation of digital libraries.	digital library;library (computing)	Nancy A.

It would seem prudent to consider addressing the issues of social interaction and social behavior on the network based upon the concept of Hardins tragedy of the commons [Hardin, 1968] in which he described a group of herders having open access to a common parcel of landknown as the Common (or town common)on which they could let their cows graze. It is in each herders interest to put as many cows as possible onto the common, even if the common is damaged as a result. The herder receives all the benefits from the additional cows and the entire group shares the damage to the common. Yet if all herders make this individually reasonable decision the commons is destroyed and all will suffer. Hardins model when coupled with a foundational understanding of the structure, function, and purpose of any online electronic mechanism will prove to be a powerful model by which to establish rules and conventions for the infrastructure. 1. Managing the Electronic Commons In 1968, biologist Garrett Hardin brought to sciences attention a little-known work by the nineteenth century amateur mathematician William Forster Lloyd on population growth and control. Lloyd examined the fate of a common pasture shared among rational, utility-maximizing herdsmen [Turner, 1991]. Shepherds grazed sheep on the individual parcels of land they owned. But there was another pasture, a large public stretch of land held in reserve, owned in common by the villagers and known, logically enough, as the Common. Then, some shepherds became greedy. They began guiding their sheep to the Common each day, preferring to wear out the public pasture because they thought it cost them nothing and saved their own small patches. Soon, others joined in, unwilling to deplete their lands while a few neighbors took advantage of the public lands. It wasn't long before the Common was turned into a muddy wastelanduseless to anyone. And as the shepherds watched their individual pastures fall to overgrazing, they realized that its own people had sacked their village. Theyd stolen their shared livelihood, economic security, cultural center, and much of their villages beauty from themselves and their children [Hardin, 1968]. Once a resource is being utilized at a rate near its carrying capacity, additional utilization will degrade its value to its current users. Users then will enter into a cycle of additional use of the resource to gain or to try to break even, as others use it. Since all users engage in this behavior, the resource is ultimately and inevitably doomed. The inexorable working out of the resources ruin is Hardin's Tragedy of the Common. In human affairs, the tragedy of the common has never been more evident than it is today. Its effects are pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, over fishing and extinction of species, abuse of aquifers, and destruction of the rain forests. http://web.media.mit.edu/~reilly/wetice2001.html (1 of 3) [4/20/2009 11:36:46 AM] Managing the Electronic Commons: But what relevance does this have to social interaction in cyberspace? This is relatively easy as, at the heart of these models/research projects, is the problem of the free-rider or the over grazer, and the issue of regulating use and behavior of a shared resource. As Ostrom [1990] notes, the challenge becomes how a group can organize and govern themselves to obtain collective benefits in situations where the temptations to free-ride and/or to break commitments are substantial. Ostrom [1990] studied a wide range of communities which had a long history of successfully producing and maintaining collective goods. She also studied a number of communities which had failed partially or completely in meeting this challenge [Kollock and Smith, 1994]. In comparing the communities, Ostrom [1990] found that groups that are able to organize and govern themselves are marked by the following design principles: • Group boundaries are clearly defined • Rules governing the use of collective goods are well matched to local needs and conditions • Most individuals affected by these rules and policies can participate in modifying the rules ad policies • The rights of community members to devise their own practices is respected by external authorities • A system for monitoring members behavior exists; this monitoring is undertaken by the community members themselves • A graduated system of remediation is used • Community members have access to low-cost conflict resolution mechanisms. Applying Ostroms observations along with a foundational understanding of the legal principles of privacy, search and seizure, and due process seems to provide a powerful model upon which the crafting of a social metaphor, which will, in-turn, serve a the basis for a social contract or at least a social norm for interactions in cyberspace. 2. The Social Contract A Transformational Approach We should explore the use a social contract. The underlying rules and conventions should be crafted/established, as other social contracts are (e.g., the US Constitution, a faculty handbook, a student handbook). Those who craft/ establish the rules and conventions for the infrastructure should certainly consider the logistical needs inherent in maintaining a secure and functional computer network. The rules and conventions, policies and procedures can be a way to manage the electronic common that will preserve the power of cooperation without infringing on individual freedom or the growth of knowledge and wisdom of which the Net is capable. The collective intelligence of the Net ought to get a chance to activate a social immune response before too many people who dont know exactly what they are panicking about call for a police force we dont need [Rheingold, 1996]. There is a more-or-less subtle, but nonetheless, transformational change that those who craft/establish rules and conventions for the infrastructure should undergo. They should shift their paradigm from one which views the management or establishment of the infrastructure as a document (written or unwritten) that informs the user primarily of what the technical and logistical requirements of computer network usage are (which most already do) to one which includes the view that a social contract is also part of the infrastructure: ● that is crafted for a demographically diverse community, ● that will facilitate the development of community, which will, in turn, facilitate the establishment of community-endorsed ethics and values. ● creating statements that treat computer network actions in the same manner that they would be treated if they occurred in the real world, and, ● providing a foundational basis for addressing and resolving social issues/dilemmas that may develop. Let me conclude that protocols need to be in place to manage social interactions in future, and existing electronic artifacts. These social contracts that underpin/support the infrastructure should be developed with a foundational http://web.media.mit.edu/~reilly/wetice2001.html (2 of 3) [4/20/2009 11:36:46 AM] Managing the Electronic Commons: understanding of: legal principles of privacy, search and seizure, and due process, and, theory of management of commonly shared resources and the inherent questions of social order. Our message is to reinforce the idea that a social consciousness must be in the foreground.

You may be looking for us to offer specifics, but the specifics rest with you, they rest with those who will create, we offer the idea that a moral compass is needed.	collective intelligence;consciousness;cyberspace;depletion region;electronic component;greedy algorithm;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interaction;logistics;norm (social);patch (computing);population;programming paradigm;property (philosophy);relevance;requirement	Rob Reilly;Barry Kort	2001		10.1109/ENABL.2001.953435	kolmogorov structure function;communications protocol;electronics;social behavior;computer science;artificial intelligence;social organization;management science;management;law;computer security;social contract;tragedy of the commons	HCI	-75.93814711173457	-13.037363757796056	160277

It is not only a technical system which is trusted but rather a socio-technical system, including users, business practices and related institutions. We will take a closer look at the concept of trust and its relation to knowledge, describe the current situation in electronic commerce, and analyse different technical approaches, that aim at providing security, and nontechnical possibilities to enhance security and trust through institutions.	closing (morphology);e-commerce;information security;sociotechnical system	Kornelia Konrad;Gerhard Fuchs;Jochen Barthel	1999		10.1109/RELDIS.1999.805124	e-commerce;information security audit;computer security model;cloud computing security;security through obscurity;security information and event management;security convergence;transaction processing;information privacy;technical communication;computer science;information security;database;security service;computer security	Security	-73.29313057953763	-10.60521076075214	161036

While definitions of concepts in this area vary, they are largely uniform in their positivity. In this paper, we outline some psychological issues with the use of technology in healthcare, including e-health, m-health, pervasive health, telehealth and related initiatives. Fundamentally, we urge a more cyberpsychological approach to the use of technology in healthcare. By illustrating with regard to the phenomenon of cyberchondria (anxiety induced by health related internet search behaviour), we explain possible downsides of e-health. Furthermore, we show how this necessitates the need for a measure of digital wellness -- consideration of how a person relates, both physically and mentally, to information technology. It is therefore recommended that eHealth researchers and practitioners consider a number of cyberpsychological concepts and related psychometric scales when they progress new initiatives.	cyberchondria;mhealth;pervasive informatics;web search engine	Ciaran McMahon;Mary Aiken	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing	10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.212	the internet;computer science;knowledge management;management science;privacy;law;information technology;computer security;statistics	Visualization	-77.2655479135883	-12.479743868731893	161138

This paper examines the ethical basis of this position, outlines its implications for professionals, institutions and society in general, and identifies its limits. Further issues that will be discussed include who carries the responsibility for informed consent, what nature it should take, whether web-based EHRs present ethically unique problems, and related security implications.

This focus permeates our field, usually in the guise of transforming digital library practices. The themes change over time (e.g., Federating library collections! Digital humanities! Digital preservation! Big data!), but dependably, digital library research projects on “innovation” topics are seeded in abundance each year. Researchers are rewarded (and funded) for their big, experimental ideas, not for successful applications of innovations in practice. Gearing resources toward “innovation” alone prizes the unique or novel approach above the cultivation of our field. Few innovations ever flower and thrive beyond their initial moments in the sun. What might happen if digital libraries shift their focus from the innovative solution to the process of using innovations within networks to actively facilitate system-wide change? Drawing from the disciplines of sociology and economics, Skinner will explore both established and emergent models for system-wide transformation, ultimately asking what digital libraries could accomplish as a field if we shifted our focus from “innovation” to “impact.”	big data;digital humanities;digital library;emergence;federated identity;library (computing);mathematical model	Katherine Skinner	2015		10.1145/2756406.2756408	innovation;workflow;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;management science;impact;standardization	HCI	-70.41362180544179	-16.32589006536201	161378

The author shows that the main technical weaknesses (self-coding and reciprocal coding) could have been avoided using simple contemporary technology, and therefore the true cause of the weaknesses is not technological but must be sought elsewhere. Specifically, human factors issues resulted in the persistent failure to seek out more effective designs. Similar limitations seem to beset the literature on the period, which misunderstands the Enigma weaknesses and therefore inhibits broader thinking about design or realising the critical role of human factors engineering in cryptography.	cryptography;enigma machine;human factors and ergonomics	Harold W.

Brousseau, for a hierarchical framing of the self-regulation of the Internet, which tries to encounter the incompleteness of solely technical means of self-regulation (standardisation or juridical selfrule) as well as the inefficiency of co-regulation in a classical sense. We evaluate this type of solution, form the point of view of it’s contribution to a process of ethical learning, taking into account the contextual conditions of access to a more reflexive self-regulation of the Internet. In order to do so, we show that it is necessary to modify the procedural approach of reflexivity in the actual attempts to regulate the Internet, through constructing more adequately the conditions of capacitation of the cooperative moment through an incentive politics of inferential nature.	convergence insufficiency;emergence;framing (world wide web);homeostasis;inferential programming;internet;manifest (transportation);mesoscopic physics;openness;sociotechnical system	Tom Dedeurwaerdere	2002			knowledge management;political science;management science	ML	-76.95597387071984	-13.111787583734728	162372

To effectively and efficiently produce, collect, and retain data, an organization develops specific defining characteristics of data to meet its informational needs. Procedures to maintain and retain knowledge among laboratory members and principal investigators will allow for improved efficiency of data collection. Optimization of communication, maintenance of inventories, record keeping, and updating relevant training programs are all critical to supporting the quality and integrity of a particular organization's data. Concurrent revisions to such procedures will ensure that the definition of data as well as the means by which it is collected and maintained remain appropriate to the needs of the individual organization.

The reliance on black-box systems in public governance is considered a great hazard since it may result in sinecures, stifles democratic control of the public domain, and results in neo-feudal monopolies. Base technology (such as the WWW technology stack) on the other hand is use-neutral, implementation-neutral, open, and teach-/learn-able, thus enabling the emergence of cascading technological ecosystems, which can drive large-scale economic and societal progress. The concepts of a primary, secondary, and tertiary technological ecosystem are introduced to delineate the role and importance of base technology. The paper calls for stronger focus on Smart City foundational research and a change in culture from quick fixes to solutions that would survive generations.	black box;ecosystem;emergence;feudalism;smart city;solution stack;www	Alois Paulin	2016		10.1145/2872518.2888614	law;democracy	Security	-76.32191646834777	-10.111258231608117	164427

1c543f7e673d10f7f8472bb12f1fdbef76a1de4e	on how to understand and acknowledge risk		In Norway two concepts in risk assessment and management – risikoforstaelse and risikoerkjennelse – have recently been given much attention, particularly in the oil and gas industry and in societal safety and security contexts. The former concept corresponds quite well to ‘risk understanding’ but the latter does not have an exact counterpart in English – the best term seems to be ‘risk acknowledgement’. The discourse related to these two concepts has given us new general insights concerning the risk concept and its practical use, and the purpose of the present paper is to point to and discuss the main observations made. A main conclusion of the paper is that justified beliefs – what we refer to as knowledge – and the processes of generating these beliefs is an essential feature of both these concepts. & 2015 The Authors.

Benbasat and Zmuds (2003) opinion is that IS has gained socio-political legitimacy but not cognitive legitimacy in large measure because the object of study in much IS research is not clearly delineated. In part, they are defining a disciplinary boundary issue and beginning to define criteria by which our field may be distinguished from reference disciplines or other related disciplines. Therefore, to gain more cognitive legitimacy, a clearer understanding of what we mean by an information system and of the central issues driving its creation and use is needed if it is at the core of that which we study. This paper advances that discourse by examining the role of a handful of French scholars, many of whom are not well known out of French academic circles, but whose thoughts on the issue are useful in furthering the debate on the ontological grounding of our field.	information system	Frantz Rowe;Duane P.

As far as entities are concerned, the reasons are mainly the effects of global phenomena of socio-economic life. Unfortunately, with the increase in the declared need for competences in the knowledge-based economy, there are a growing number of knowledge workers without jobs and livelihood. Social inequalities are rising. At the same time, the productivity in enterprises is increasing, the profits are growing, and the wages are declining. Knowledge workers without stable jobs are the new dangerous class """"precariat"""" of enormous magnitude.

As a concept, the Information Society has retained a form of residual currency but while not quite dormant, it has been overshadowed by what are essentially techno-economic New Economy perspectives. Although these techno-economic priorities can be viewed as contributing to the ultimate development of an Information Society, this contribution continues to fall somewhat short of what would be deemed sufficient. The shortfalls are particularly evident in the case of socially disadvantaged members of the community. In reviewing such developments mainly in Europe but with examples drawn from elsewhere, progress towards Information Society status is assessed in a social context that illustrates the gap that exists between aspiration and achievement in this regard.	e-government;electronic business;new economy	Bill Martin	2005	J.

From an observer at the interface, it would seem to have gone through a number of phases. The first was to broadly define the scope of the field. This has been done, though as SSME begins to mature, this scope has been questioned and it can be argued that it is rather narrow and could be expanded. The second phase in which many including the lead author of this paper participated, was to argue that before a totally new field was developed it was important that the depth of existing knowledge be recognised and brought into the arena. It would now seem that this stage is well on the way and diverse and multi-disciplinary sets of knowledge from systems, operations, marketing and engineering are being brought together.

Put another way, how might we develop a new engineering ethic, which focuses more upon the results as evidence by its adoption across the myriad of disciplines rather than the purity or elegance of the argument? The present work seeks to offer one approach that might work borrowing from our developing view of complex systems theory. One important characteristic of a complex system - and we shall consider others - is that a system is composed of interconnected parts that as a whole exhibit one or more properties. Stated another way, the behavior among the possible properties may not be obvious from the properties of the individual parts. The proposed new ethic also integrates new ideas from quantum mechanics as well as eco-philosophy.	gulf of execution	George D.

An analysis of specific problems in economics leads to a full discussion of the Open Peer Review (OPR) system developed by the World Economics Association (WEA) and the principles behind it. The system is open in the following two respects: (a) disclosure of names of authors and reviewers; and (b) inclusivity of potential reviewers in terms of paradigmatic approaches, country, and community. The paper then discusses the applicability of the same system to other disciplines. In doing so, it stressed the aims of various evaluation systems and the possible pitfalls of rating systems.

When we speak of a model for the future society we often use the term the information society or the networked society. Information society and network society are not new concepts but have existed for many years (Machlup, 1962 and Nora & Minc, 1980). The reason that these definitions are on the agenda today is the dramatic development in information technology and telecommunications technology – these two technologies that are decisive for dealing with information and dissemination of information in networks. The use of these terms underlines the importance that these two technologies have for our society. The basic development in technology is taking place in a global scale and only few countries are in a position, where they can influence how fast and in which direction the development is heading is extremely limited. On the other hand, the societal development is in no way dictated by how these technologies develop. Technology can be used in different ways and the way technology is applied specifically depends on both economic and political factors. Consequently, there may be substantial variations between countries in how ICT is applied. Each country can – within certain limits – choose their own version of the information society. The use of ICT has practically exploded in recent years. Today ICT has many different applications and penetrates into all levels of the society – both in the public sector as well as in the private sector and also in private homes. The use of ICT not only brings about effective production but changes at the same time the character of many of the functions using ICT. This applies not least into the more service-minded and information intensive parts of society. Differing from many other technologies ICT is used not only to rationalize production of goods but also to reform administrative routines both in the private and public sectors. ICT, therefore, not only expands the technological space wherein a certain decision must be taken but influences directly the pattern of decision-making. This paper deals with the kind of challenges ICT poses to the present form for societal governance and democratic control. ICT penetrates all parts of the political decision-making. The political parties and movements have their own web-sites. The public sector uses the Internet to inform citizens and will in the longer run also …	altran praxis;collective intelligence;computing the permanent;course (navigation);disk sector;emergent democracy;internet;networked society;telecommuting	Morten Falch	2006	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2005.06.001	corporate governance;public relations;information and communications technology;management;law;economic growth	HCI	-76.45064760901077	-10.408224393303582	170024

The person who is designated to handle research misconduct is typically referred to as the research integrity officer (RIO). In this interview study we report on 79 RIOs who describe how they would handle allegations of research misconduct. Their responses were compared to two expert RIOs. The responses to the allegations in the scenarios demonstrated that RIOs are not uniformly well prepared to handle activities associated with reported allegations of research misconduct. We recommend greater preparation through directed training, use of check lists of possible behaviors necessary to consider when situations arise, being involved in a network of RIOs so one can discuss options, and the possible need to certify RIOs.	behavior;cyclic redundancy check;norm (social);seventy nine;united states indian health service	Arthur J.

ICANN was formed in the fall of 1998 in response to a White House """" White Paper """" issued by Ira Magaziner, then a senior advisor for policy to President Bill Clin-ton. ICANN would undertake to form a private sector entity to carry out the coordinated assignment of Internet domain names, Internet addresses, and the maintenance of parameter registries needed for the operation of the suite of protocols used in the Internet. These functions had been managed by Jonathan Postel acting as the IANA at USC Information Sciences Institute (and other earlier institutions where Postel had worked) under various government contracts. By 1996, the In-ternet was experiencing its so-called """" dot boom """" and the potential scale and liabilities of carrying out the IANA functions led to a serious effort to in-stitutionalize the operation. For lack of space, I will leave out two years of community debate and fast-forward to the creation of ICANN to fulfill these functions. ICANN was conceived as a multi-stakeholder organization drawing on input from the private sector, civil society , governments of the world, and the technical community for the development of policy for the IANA functions and for the coordination of the multiple parties having a role in managing these unique identifiers and parameters. In 1998, many organizations were involved in the evolution and operation of the Internet, its Domain Name System (DNS), Internet address allocation, and standards development. The Inter-net Society, founded in 1991, housed the standards-oriented Internet Architecture Board and the Internet Engineering Task Force. There were then three Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) for Internet address alloca-tion—RIPE-NCC, APNIC, and ARIN— and two more to follow later (LACNIC and AFRINIC). There were nominally 13 DNS Root Server operators providing top-level domain name resolution. Verisign generated and distributed the official domain name root zone based on input from IANA and, under the terms of the NTIA/ICANN contract, authorization from NTIA. Many domain name registries and registrars were created to support DNS operation. The original plan was for ICANN to operate under NTIA oversight for a few years and then operate as an independent organization. In fact, the contractual obligations extended from 1998 to the present. In March 2014, however, NTIA proposed this contractual relationship for the IANA functions …"""	authorization;fast forward;ianal;itu t.50;information sciences institute;internet architecture board;neural correlates of consciousness;unique identifier	Vinton G.

32318154569f4a07311d2832baf68c2f7989dde4	"""a review of: """"addressing the world: national identity and internet country code domains"""""""	national identity	This 2003 volume explores a concern that has possibly never occurred to most Americans: the significance of one’s own country code within a domain name. Americans have been privileged in their enjoyment of a welldeveloped set of Internet domain names that lack a “.us” component in part because so many of the Internet’s domain locations are already either run from the United States or cater to U.S. businesses and users: The absence of a country code implies a U.S. domain. Such default conventions are part historical accident and part legacy of longstanding business practices, but in any case they underscore why this book may appeal to many researchers. Simply put, it challenges assumptions about not only how the Internet operates but also what its naming conventions mean for issues of local and national identity, for access to free and uncensored communication capabilities, and for matters of political—and commercial—expression. Composed of 11 country-focused chapters, an Internet governance background chapter, and a context-setting introduction and conclusion, both written by editor Erica Schlesinger Wass, the book presents a set of case studies that profile individual countries’ efforts to establish their country domains. Peter Yu, an expert in intellectual property law, contributes a brief history of the Internet’s governance structure, a structure that at this writing is far from well established. Country code top-level domains (the “.us” for the United States or “.fr” for France or “.my” for Malaysia) are but one category of dilemmas faced by the international Internet governance organization ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Yu draws attention to the difficulties of attempting to implement an Internet structure based on the four principles proposed in the United States-spawned Domain Name System White Paper from 1998: stability, competition, private bottom-up coordination, and representation, especially as the late 1990s brought the commercialization of the Internet and an increased recognition of the economic and social value of a country code. What began as a friendly, simple administrative structure for designating country code top-level domains as implemented by John Postel—who relied on the idea of a “responsible person” in different countries for assigning second-level domains—became an often fractious and political process, supercharged with visions of making money from certain domain names. Country-specific cases in each of the following chapters illustrate how the virtuous principles that initiated the Internet’s organization often butt heads with national desires and economic opportunism. To some extent, the issue of local identity embedded within a country code can strike some as a nonissue: Since the Internet is international, and since one can register a domain outside one’s own country, and since one can use top-level domains such as .edu or .com with no appended country code, why should the appearance of a country code in a domain name matter? Is it, after all, a matter of three additional keystrokes? Internet URLs are in their way intrinsically global. The chapters here illustrate the nuanced utilities of those three keystrokes. As a group, these case studies repeatedly contrast the backdrop of the Internet’s cultivation by well-meaning, gifted and dedicated engineers and computer scientists, whose early priorities established an Internet culture that prioritized efficiency and fairness, with the interests and machinations of political systems that prioritize incumbent national interests and control and economic realities that cater to profiteering impulses. The prospect of a neutral Internet bereft of entanglement in the usual tugs-of-war observed daily within national and international governing units was probably an impossibility from the outset. Even so, that the Internet operates as fairly, as widely, and as problem-free as it currently does is quite remarkable, given the difficulties in overlaying national governing authorities with a	accident (philosophy);backdrop cms;computer scientist;cyberculture;embedded system;event (computing);fairness measure;internet;quantum entanglement;value (ethics)	Sharon Strover	2006	Inf.

To support such advancement, researchers and government agencies have been working towards a """"science of security"""". As in other sciences, security science requires high-quality fundamental research addressing important problems and reporting approaches that capture the information necessary for replication, meta-analysis, and theory building. The goal of this paper is to aid security researchers in establishing a baseline of the state of scientific reporting in security through an analysis of indicators of scientific research as reported in top security conferences, specifically the 2015 ACM CCS and 2016 IEEE S&P proceedings. To conduct this analysis, we employed a series of rubrics to analyze the completeness of information reported in papers relative to the type of evaluation used (e.g. empirical study, proof, discussion). Our findings indicated some important information is often missing from papers, including explicit documentation of research objectives and the threats to validity. Our findings show a relatively small number of replications reported in the literature. We hope that this initial analysis will serve as a baseline against which we can measure the advancement of the science of security."""	baseline (configuration management);documentation;replication (computing);threat (computer)	Morgan Burcham;Mahran Al-Zyoud;Jeffrey C.

We argue that a stigma may exist that is worn with pride rather than shame, and we refer to this as a """"prestigious stigma."""" As a foundation for our reasoning, we present """"technology geek"""" as a prestigious stigma found in organizations.

Consequently, information managers seek to facilitate the use of such human information sources. Although various studies about what influences the use of human information sources in organizations exist, it is difficult for information managers to utilize insights from this research body. The studies have provided contradictory results regarding the role of accessibility and quality and suffer from various weaknesses. To address these weaknesses, several studies are employing other research methods. This study aims to contribute to the methodological development of this emerging new line of research by exploring the value of a think aloud approach to such studies. In addition, it aims to provide more insight into the role of accessibility and quality in the selection of human information sources in organizations. Fifty-six employees from four governmental organizations were asked to think aloud while selecting human information sources. The findings of this study corroborate those of studies taking a similar approach: source quality is the most dominant factor in the selection of human information sources. The think aloud approach seems a valuable contribution to available research methods to assess the role of accessibility and quality in human source selection in organizations. _ 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A large number of economic, political, and legal challenges exist within the current marketplace that serves as relative impediments to independent invention. This article explores the existing challenges facing the independent inventor and offers a number of recommendations and resources to facilitate independent inventors in their quest for innovation and entrepreneurship. The concept of “outsourcing innovation” is discussed as an alternative to the existing model of industry sponsored research and development (R&D), with the goal of combining the unique attributes and strengths of independent inventors and industry sponsors.	academia (organization);bloch sulzberger syndrome;increment;independent inventor;informatics (discipline);information sciences;intellectual property;legal patent;medical imaging;new product development;out of the box (feature);outsourcing;programming paradigm;region of interest;research and development;synergy;thinking outside the box	Bruce I.

It is an ethical dilemma since it is about promoting good in the context of the potential for also causing harm, e.g., the promotion of health in the context of providing the wherewithal for the killing of innocents. It is an ethical dilemma for the researcher because of the potential actions of others, e.g., malevolent non-researchers who might steal dangerous biological agents, or make use of the original researcher's work. And it is a dilemma for governments concerned with the security of their citizens, as well as their health. In this article we construct a taxonomy of types of """"experiments of concern"""" in the biological sciences, and thereby map the terrain of ethical risk. We then provide a series of analyses of the ethical problems and considerations at issue in the dual-use dilemma, including the impermissibility of certain kinds of research and possible restrictions on dissemination of research results given the risks to health and security.

While that may sound easy enough, any IT security professional will tell you that properly and thoroughly securing an IT environment is an ongoing and uphill battle. Hackers and IT security vendors and administrators play a constant cat and mouse game to stay ahead of one other. We are all painfully aware that 100% security is impossible to achieve – unfortunately, even with 99.9% security, it’s that miniscule 0.1% that is the weak link in the security chain that time and time again ultimately leads to an organization being breached. While many security administrators accept that a breach may occur in their futures, very few have a solid understanding of how they would handle the situation and the investigative response process.

These companies accumulate extensive personal data about individuals with minimal concern for us, the subjects of this process. This can cause many harms: privacy infringement, personal and professional embarrassment, restricted access to labour markets, restricted access to best value pricing, and many others. There is a critical need to provide technologies that enable alternative practices, so that individuals can participate in the collection, management and consumption of their personal data. In this paper we discuss the Databox, a personal networked device (and associated services) that collates and mediates access to personal data, allowing us to recover control of our online lives. We hope the Databox is a first step to re-balancing power between us, the data subjects, and the corporations that collect and use our data.	internet;personally identifiable information;primary source;thinking outside the box;tree accumulation	Hamed Haddadi;Heidi Howard;Amir Chaudhry;Jon A Crowcroft;Anil Madhavapeddy;Richard Mortier	2015	CoRR	10.7146/aahcc.v1i1.21312	public relations;telecommunications;computer science;personal information management;data protection act 1998;internet privacy;management;privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-71.15965474832907	-11.145012145960694	176383

Several conceptual and methodological problems, such as a lack of technological transparency, have made a detailed analysis of concrete power relations and their effects difficult. This paper argues that a microeconomic approach can aid media scholars in examining the complex interactions that underpin the dynamics of information visibility unfolding around the Google search engine. Using the concept of a ‘three-sided market’, we characterize the business model built around google.com as the foundation of the company’s success. We then argue that the combination of search and advertising services, and in particular advertising network services, creates powerful incentives to orient the results page in self-serving ways, leading to fundamental conflicts of interest exacerbated by Google’s dominant position in both markets. Based on search engines’ mass media-like capacity to shape public discourse, we consider the identification of economic forces both as a prerequisite for a robust critique of the current situation and as a starting point for thinking about regulatory measures.

This short paper provides a starting point for scholars interested in studying indie games. Beginning with a mission statement that addresses some of the challenges and opportunities of indie game studies, the paper surveys eleven years of research on the history, theory, political economy, and socio-cultural aspects of indie games and highlights tensions or gaps. The paper concludes by identifying productive avenues for future inquiry, arguing that indie games should be more fully integrated into game studies as a field.	computer hardware;dependency theory (database theory);exploit (computer security);indie game jam;privilege (computing);situated cognition;spawn (computing)	Felan Parker	2013			humanities;simulation;game mechanics;political science;operations research	HCI	-76.4318412143245	-14.879185717757851	177396

It is the contention of the authors that it is possible to get a richer interpretation of research findings by reviewing the results more than once, using more than one interpretive perspective. After a first round of interpretation was done, using Habermas' knowledge interests, hermeneutics and Giddens' 'consequences of contemporary modernity' as perspectives, certain concepts in the abundance of empirical results emerged as being more important than others. A further round of interpretation (using Klein and Myers' principles for evaluating interpretive studies) was done to refine the model in order to derive a conceptual framework.

There is dominant optimistic and praising view of the potentialities of the decentralized public ledgers. However most of the changes and cutting-edge impact of Blockchain technology remains misunderstood or unknown. This paper aims to propose a more critical perspective of the Blockchain implications highlighting the limitations, the controversies and the drawbacks of public distributed ledgers. An illustration from the monetary system is presented to propose an example of socio-economic implication. By presenting a case regarding the central bank digital currency (CBDC) system, which is now being, introduced as a counter policy against the emergence of the private crypto-currency system. We elaborate what CBDC is trying to solve and yet at the same time what potential problems might arise from this system. We conclude that the introduction of the Blockchain technology should be valued and evaluated in a more thorough way.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;digital currency;emergence	Soumaya I.

It is important to protect innovations and to curb the copyright infringements in computer-based systems. Copyright is a legal framework of basic rights, allowing the owner to control or permit someone else to reproduce copyrighted works with commercial value. In recent decades, copyright violations have been moving into the criminal realm. This paper focuses on the procedure guidance of a fictitious P2P model, and discusses whether it contributes to the crime of copyright infringement in dealing with the distribution of digital content. From the perspective of internet forensics, the action research and the whole control mechanism, it is shown that a commercial server has full control over the P2P model.	authorization;client–server model;file sharing;peer-to-peer;server (computing);software developer;source-to-source compiler	Shiuh-Jeng Wang;Da-Yu Kao;Frank Fu-Yuan Huang	2009	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2008.09.009	telecommunications;computer science;action research;peer-to-peer;database;internet privacy;forensic science;law;world wide web;computer security;client–server model	Security	-70.95719338315402	-10.291336344977426	179750

Ransomware, malicious software that demands payment in exchange for a stolen functionality, has grown beyond expectations. The development and distribution of ransomware is stimulated by social networks active in the Dark Net. From the cyber criminal perspective, this is an ideal platform to participate in a business ecosystem, either as an author, vendor or distributor of ransomware. Within the Dark Net, they can find forums and marketplaces that offer complete secrecy and concealment of the user’s identity. Studying the activities taking place within the Dark Net sites can improve our situational awareness on upcoming threats and how we can defend against them. In this research, a netnographic study was done to obtain useful data such as observations of the marketplace economies and reflections on the social interactions between the different stakeholders involved in the creation and distribution of ransomware.

b00a624000b98c6a02fbfd27599d341e77f029d2	data fraud detection: a first general perspective		We try to present a first broad overview on data fraud, and give hints to data fraud detection (DFD). Especially, we show examples of data fraud that happened at anytime of human mankind, all around the world, and affects all kind of human activities. For instance, betrayers are entities of the society, industry, banks, services, health-care, non-profit organizations, art, science, media or even a government or the Vatican. We consider four main areas of data fraud: spy out, plagiarism, manipulation and fabrication of data. Of course, there is not only interest on data fraud itself but on its detection, too. Although improvements of data fraud detection is evident, it seems that the intellectual creativity and capacity of the betrayers is unlimited. Especially, the Internet with its various services and the mobile communication opened the Pandora box for criminal acts. Furthermore, one may state the hypothesis that while the ethics behavior of people decreases over time the data fraud rate is continuously increasing. There does not exist an omnibus data fraud detector, and the author supposes there will be never one upcoming due to the heterogeneity of the domain. For instance, compare the domains“spy out” in industry and“data fabrication” of observational or experimental studies in science. It is a matter of fact that the interest and need of science, business and governmental authorities is increasing over time for improving tests of data fraud detection. This paper can be viewed as a modest attempt for stimulating research into this direction.	anytime algorithm;data flow diagram;entity;internet	Hans-Joachim Lenz	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-22348-3_2	knowledge management;computer science;data mining;enterprise architecture;bibliographic coupling;fabrication;government;data manipulation language	ML	-73.5076116607472	-12.026187230436298	179943

The focus of this coverage was on language in the CDA that sought to limit “indecency” on the Internet. In addition to the media coverage, the Internet’s own Blue Ribbon campaign popularly characterized the CDA as an anti-smut initiative. When the Supreme Court struck down the indecency provisions of the CDA in Reno vs. ACLU, the popular and professional media again responded, this time lauding the court for ensuring free speech on the Web by repudiating the CDA. Contrary to most reporting, Reno did not strike down the CDA. Instead, it left intact the vast majority of the Act, and what remains has important implications for IS administrators. The CDA has received previous coverage in Communications (see [6, 8]). As in most reporting on the CDA, this coverage focused exclusively on the indecency provisions of the Act, and its ramifications for free speech and economic development of the Internet [3–5, 7].

The concept of biological diversity was first formally defined in the conservation literature by Elliott Norse and Roger McManus in the 1980 Council on Environmental Quality Annual Report. The term was immediately adopted by groups who perceived that their interests would be impacted by the loss of variety of animal and plant life. The definition of biological diversity would ultimately evolve to consist of three levels: genetic diversity, species diversity; and ecosystem diversity. Of those three levels in the immediate years following the term's introduction, it was the concern over genetic diversity which received the most attention. The first conference held on the topic was dominated by groups interested in the use and conservation of genetic resources. In the mid-1980s, several articles published in the technology journals (such as Issues in Science and Technology) helped to launch the concept of biological diversity towards its present popularity, largely because of the concern over diminishing genetic reservoirs in natural areas. In summary, efforts by those interested in the technological applications of genetic diversity played a significant role in disseminating and advancing awareness of the issues surrounding the loss of biological diversity.	ecosystem diversity;elliott brothers (computer company);pervasive informatics	Timothy J.

In particular, it is often argued that the technical expertise required to mount successful cyber attacks is declining as a consequence of new offensive resources, such as attack scripts and userfriendly attack execution tools, becoming available in the public domain. These resources include, for example, exploit databases such as Packet Storm and Exploit Database, and attack execution frameworks such as Metasploit, Armitage and BurpSuite. This theory is in referenced by various works in the cyber security domain. For example, Liu and Chen (Liu & Cheng 2009) state that “attack tools and techniques have become increasingly automated and sophisticated over the past decade, whereas the technical knowledge and skills required to use these tools has decreased dramatically”. The same trend is described by the NATO (Robinson 2016), among others. Liu and Chen (Liu & Cheng 2009) even suggests that “all it takes is the basic ability to follow instructions and push buttons”. An attacker with this low level of skill, knowledge or ambition is often referred to as a “script kiddie”. Simmonds et al. (Simmonds et al. 2004) refer to a script kiddie as “someone who uses already established and part automated techniques in attacking a system”; Hald and Pedersen (Hald & Pedersen 2012) refer to the script kiddie as “one who relies on premade exploit programs and files (""""scripts"""") to conduct his hacking, and refuses to bother to learn how they work”. Most other taxonomies and ontologies that characterize hackers describe script kiddies similarly (Rogers 2006). The idea that script kiddies and other novice cyber criminals represent an increasing threat due to the increased sophistication and automation is widespread and influence decision making on many different levels. For example, ENISA (Lévy-Bencheton et al. 2015) considers the script kiddie as threat agent that can realize some 30 different cyber threats and are, with the exception of physical attacks, relevant to the same type of threats as nation states. Others’ have suggested that anybody could use exploit kits to steal online banking credentials (Choo 2011). The present paper aims to analyze whether unsophisticated cyber attacks that a typical script kiddie is able to perform actually pose a threat to systems today.

Whilst information as a commod ity and as a concept may be too complex to be articulated within neo-classical economic models, such models still provide the framework within which economic arguments are conducted. Of central importance is the idea of the market as a transmitter of information. Keynes' approach advocated government intervention to address the problem of market information failure and to return the economy to equilibrium. Conversely, the philosophical position of the New Right is that State intervention is unnecessary and that an unfettered market, closely tied to a 'spontaneous order', is both a suitable conveyer of information, and also provides a means for the efficient allocation of resources. However, given the informational problems inherent in economic theory, it is argued that, paradoxically, the free market requires an active and interventionist Stat...	information	Tim Hayward;Judith Broady-Preston	1994	J.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers with an active interest in cross-cultural studies in CSCW, discuss methodological challenges, and arrive at a common understanding of methodological approaches that can be the basis of best practice in our research community. Through presentations on specific methodological problems, such as access to diverse populations, study design, and data analysis, we expect in depth discussions around each of these challenges and, ultimately, to improve the quality of and support the growth of cross-cultural research in the CSCW community.	best practice;collaborative software;computer-supported cooperative work;population	Pamela Hinds;Katharina Reinecke	2014		10.1145/2556420.2558856	social science;knowledge management;management science;anthropology;cross-cultural	HCI	-76.58667929691079	-15.842951181925784	183512

Laws requiring data to be hosted within a particular jurisdiction tend to upset existing ideas about how the Internet should work. Some countries, particularly the USA, have labelled such laws as trade barriers. Other countries, such as Russia and China, have claimed they are pursuing legitimate strategies to protect their citizenry. With a particular focus upon the BRICs, this article aims to make an original contribution to this discourse by synthesizing insights from the disciplines of international trade law and internet governance to analyse and separate the rhetoric from the reality of these competing claims. Drawing upon evidence from information leaked by Edward Snowden about the activities of the US National Security Agency, the article argues that underlying these tensions is the battle to retain or reduce the comparative advantage the US has historically enjoyed in economies of scale for its Internet signals intelligence capabilities. Underneath the debate over trade issues, this article argues that data localization laws are being supported by some countries not only as a means to reduce their comparative disadvantage in Internet data hosting, but also to reduce their comparative disadvantage in Internet signals intelligence. K E Y W O R D S : data localization, International trade law, cybersecurity, BRICs I N T R O D U C T I O N While trade over the Internet is rapidly growing, challenges are emerging from the historical separation which has existed between the two fields of trade regulation and internet governance. Decisions made by stakeholders about how to regulate the Internet are being challenged as trade barriers. This article explores one instance of the emerging collision between trade and the Internet: whether policies that require the local hosting of data should be considered trade barriers.

The section ‘The concept of data localization’of this article provides a brief explanation of data localization. Section ‘What motivates the Usa to resist foreign countries’ proposals for localized data hosting?’ explores the rationale underlying opposition to data localization by US-based stakeholders, including the US government. The section ‘Limitations on data localization contained in next generation trade agreements’ describes how data localization has been contested in five of the next-generation of regional trade agreements: three agreements promoted by the USA which prohibit data localization (and exclude China) and two agreements promoted by China which do not. Section ‘Domestic laws implementing data localization’ examines successful and failed attempts to introduce data localization policies within domestic legal frameworks in four of the US’ largest trade competitors: the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China). The section ‘Separating theory and rhetoric from reality’ analyses four policy debates about data localization, distinguishing rhetorical claims from underlying realpolitik so as to identify potential reasons why it is such a contested policy issue. T H E C O N C E P T O F D A T A L O C A L I Z A T I O N One of many fundamental assumptions that the Internet has been built upon is universal connectivity, ie that every node can freely communicate with every other node. Another fundamental assumption has been that the network is dumb at the centre and smart at the edges, ie that it is Internet users who control what they do over the Internet, whereas network providers only route traffic between those users without applying further policy controls over the contents of those communications. Data localization is a concept which challenges those assumptions. Data localization has two meanings. The first is a policy whereby national governments compel Internet content hosts to store data about Internet users in their country on servers located within the jurisdiction of that national government (localized data hosting). The data stored in the local jurisdiction may be either the sole copy of the data or a required local copy of data sent for storage or processing in another jurisdiction. The second form of data localization is a policy, whereby national governments compel Internet service providers to route data packets sent between Internet users located in their jurisdictions across networks located only within their jurisdiction (localized data routing). This article addresses only the first type of data localization. accessed 18 December 2016; Kuan Hon and others, ‘Policy, Legal and Regulatory Implications of a European Only Cloud’ (2016) 24 IJLIT 251. 2 Anupam Chander and Uyen Le, ‘Data Nationalism’ (2015) 64 Emory LR 677. 3 Chander and Le (n 2) 713. 4 Jerome Saltzer and others, ‘End-to-End Arguments in System Design’ in Amit Bhargava (ed) Integrated Broadband Networks (Artech House 1991); Lawrence Lessig, Code Version2.0 (Basic Books 2006) 38–60. 5 Chander and Le, above n 2, 680. 2 Data Localization Laws	chandler (software);cloud computing;computer security;design rationale;email;internet;lr parser;network packet;next-generation network;prism (surveillance program);routing;signals intelligence;snowden	John Selby	2017	I.

A range of significant strategic, consumer and policy issues also arise, such as challenges to the operation of copyright, defamation and other censorship laws. Organisations affected by P2P are devising and deploying countermeasures, such as technological protections for digital works and attempts to identify devices and users. These too require study.

Imagine that workers are allowed to elect their own bosses and vote directly on important company decisions. Imagine organizations where most workers aren't employees at all, but electronically connected freelancers living wherever they want to. And imagine that all this freedom in business lets people get more of whatever they really want in life—money, interesting work, helping other people, or time with their families. These things are already happening today and—if we choose—they can happen even more in the future. We are now in the early stages of a profound increase in human freedom in business that may, in the long run, be as important for businesses as the change to democracies was for governments. The key enabler for this remarkable change is information technology. By reducing the costs of communication, these technologies now make it possible for many more people, even in huge organizations, to have the information they need to make decisions for themselves, instead of just following orders from above. And so, for the first time in human history, we can now have the best of both worlds—the economic and scale efficiencies of large organizations, and the human benefits of small ones: freedom, motivation, creativity, and flexibility.	money	Thomas W.

The organising image is one of seeing two trajectories at work in the polity, trajectories that hitherto have too often been treated as separate but which are ineluctably intertwined. The first of these trajectories is that of information intensifying government/governance and the second, the trajectory associated with communications intensifying democratic character of the polity as both formally initiated in experimentation and innovation and in the informal, spontaneous democratic impulses that have emerged from the era of social networking, or 'web 2.0'. Drawn together these trajectories make up the wider polity, an information-and communications-intensive polity. Separating them for analytical purposes allows examination of the different paces of change in each of these trajectories, enabling speculative conclusions to be drawn, perhaps more accurately than otherwise, about what to expect in this century's third decade.

Multi-lifespan design and other longer-term approaches offer alternative models. In this paper, we contribute one alternative model for cross-boundary research partnerships spanning longer timeframes and offer one best practice: collaborative reflection. Specifically, we provide an in-depth case study of a multi-lifespan design partnership (over nine years and ongoing) between a Rwandan NGO focused on peacebuilding and a US university research group focused on information design theory and method. First, we document our process for conducting a collaborative reflection that seeks balance among the contributors while navigating differences in culture, discipline, experience, and skills. Next, we reflect on five themes: (1) common ground: sensibilities and commitments; (2) trust; (3) research landscape: crossing nations and institutions; (4) research as a healing mechanism; and (5) multi-lifespan design partnership. We conclude with a discussion of overarching considerations for design researchers who engage in cross-boundary research partnership.	best practice;file spanning;information design;nar 2	Daisy Yoo;Odeth Kantengwa;Nick Logler;Reverien Interayamahanga;Joseph Nkurunziza;Batya Friedman	2018		10.1145/3173574.3173853	peacebuilding;multimedia;knowledge management;best practice;general partnership;information design;common ground;computer science	HCI	-76.8218154171653	-15.727787358902267	185069

During the last ten years, industry has been central in shaping a new corporate environmentalism. Now, we argue, it is time to take a critical look at the nature and scope of corporate actions and scientific research within the field of corporate environmental management. This paper takes a starting point in the assertions that: (i) available evidence indicates that the carrying capacity of the environment is in several respects being exceeded, and (ii) environmental progress is hindered by an inherent self-interest (both producers and consumers). Based on epistemological as well as empirical analyses, the paper concludes that industry has succeeded in taking over the environmental debate and turning it into a question of self-regulated eco-modernist actions.	apply;consciousness;environmental resource management;noise shaping;redirection (computing);supremacy: your will be done	John P.

All these objects are timemachines containing answers to questions related to IT processes, unlawful acts and economic transactions. Inherent in each is the ability to reconstruct the who, what, when, where, why and how of an IT, legal or financial transaction. As society continually evolves toward a digital existence, however, computer logs are the fabric underlying transactions that once occurred exclusively in the physical realm. As a result, logs are registering on the radar screens of business, technical and legal professionals proportionate to thedegree towhich theirwork involves computers. This is to say, as crimes, disputes and social wrongs increasingly involve or target the use of computers, and as business relies on information systems to function, digital logs are the eyewitnesses. Realizing that human eyewitnesses are only as valuable as their perception, memory and cognition, so too are digital logs in their ability to paint a picture of a digital event(s). Similarly, just as persons cannot predict or prepare for eyewitness events, it is difficult to foreknow which digital transactions will necessitate recreation in resolving a dispute.

Unfortunately, engineering new systems will take years, and many jurisdictions are unlikely to be able to afford new equipment in the near future. In this paper we ask how jurisdictions can make the best use of the equipment they already own until they can replace it. Starting from current practice, we propose defenses that involve new but realistic procedures, modest changes to existing software, and no changes to existing hardware.

They do not provide security against insiders with access to election management systems, which appears to require significantly greater changes to the existing systems.	table (information)	J.

Increasingly organizations are being ordered by law or lawsuit to preserve, retrieve, and hand-over relevant electronic records (e-records) because """"the courts are uniformly recognizing the discoverability of electronic communication and documents"""" [Nimsger and Lange, 2002]. This trend is an outgrowth of aggressive tactics by regulators to ensure corporate accountability and deter fraud. In cases ranging from Securities and Exchange Commission probes of corporate malfeasance and insider trading to employment lawsuits, e-records are subpoenaed. Investigations conducted by the National Association of Security Dealers, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security routinely require companies, their business partners, or third parties to preserve and disclose e-records, including internal e-mail and instant messages (IM). A highprofile example is the probe into alleged White House leaks of a covert CIA agent's identity in which White House employees received e-mail stating: ''You must preserve all materials that might in any way be related to the department's investigation.'' E-mail, telephone logs, and other electronic documents were mentioned specifically. Any communication or file storage device is subject to computer forensic searches to identify, examine, and preserve potential e-evidence—the electronic equivalent of a """"smoking gun."""" Preserving e-records and then restoring them so that they can be searched can seriously disrupt IS and over-burden Information Systems staff. What's more, a preservation order might specify not only the type of e-records (data files or email), but also stipulate that processes that over-write data be suspended, or that backup tapes be retained for unspecified duration. These stipulations are very disruptive to IS operations. That disruption depends largely on whether the company had an e-record management (ERM) system to systemically review, retain, and destroy e-records received or created in the course of business. This article presents an overview of e-evidence and computer forensics and their implications for Information Systems. It aims to encourage research into ERM and fully-indexed, searchable email archives by providing compelling reasons for how these approaches mitigate e-evidence risks and cost. These research issues are important for several reasons. Rarely are IS 458 Communications of the Association for Information Systems (Volume 12, 2003) 457-468 Electronic Evidence and Computer Forensics by L. Volonino departments prepared for the challenges that evidentiary rules impose on active and archival data operations. Retaining unessential e-records increases costs and risks. Companies may need to justify their e-record retention and destruction policies as proof of compliance with their accounting, regulatory, or legal obligations. Courts impose severe sanctions on employers who claim they are unable to comply with e-record requests because of Information Systems design flaws or sloppy e-records management if it obstructs an investigation."""	computer forensics;cooperative breeding;discoverability;email;habitat;instant messaging;know-how trading;mail (macos)	Linda Volonino	2003	CAIS		computer forensics	Security	-71.65076253603475	-10.434806784339973	188334

It is often available at no cost and is mostly supported by developers providing their services for free. Considerable interest has been shown in OSS by tertiary education institutions (TEIs) because of the promise of a reduced total cost of ownership of the software, potentially better support, freedom from vendor lock–in, ability to tailor the software and pedagogic benefits of being able to view the source code. To find out the extent of use of OSS by TEIs in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, a survey was sent out to technical personnel at all TEIs in these countries. The results of the survey show that OSS is already being used by all TEIs who responded to the survey and that the major reasons for this was lower Total Cost of Ownership and freedom from software vendor dependence. It is clear however that the majority of the OSS software being used is in server infrastructure with a lesser amount being used on normal desktop machines.	open-source software	David G.

While we have invested significant time and effort to create and capture information in the digital form, and are making great strides towards making digital information available in every community across the world, we do not have the ability to make this information available across generations of information technology, making it accessible with future technology and enabling people to determine whether it is authentic and reliable. This paper reports on the current status of digital preservation, an emerging field involving computer science, information technology, library science, and archival science. Digital preservation must be considered in a broader context, namely the life cycle of information. In the life cycle of information, we describe all essential factors for preserving digital records, including not only formats, structures, and types of digital records but also access software services, computing environments, even security keys and authenticity signatures and certificates of the records. Our finding is that preservation of digital records will be a major undertaking, but feasible solutions do exist.

Research and introduction of new technologies do, by their very nature, look to bring about positive change in society. Often though, changes result in unintended, unexpected, unforeseen, unforeseeable and unaddressed consequences. It often becomes the role of ethics protocols to militate against these negative consequences. In trying to establish the levels of awareness among South African researchers and producers of biofuels, to the sustainable development dilemmas brought about by their work; the “Five Capitals Framework” and a research ethics protocol, research was carried out at three South African businesses, generating data from interviews and collaborating with data from company publications. The study concluded that industry was indeed aware of the dilemmas that face their industry albeit that it was not in the context of a defined necessary framework.

Hence, OSNs are also an important--and popular--subject for research. To perform research based on real-life evidence, however, researchers may need to access OSN data, such as texts and files uploaded by users and connections among users. This raises significant ethical problems. Currently, there are no clear ethical guidelines, and researchers may end up (unintentionally) performing ethically questionable research, sometimes even when more ethical research alternatives exist. For example, several studies have employed """"fake identities"""" to collect data from OSNs, but fake identities may be used for attacks and are considered a security issue. Is it legitimate to use fake identities for studying OSNs or for collecting OSN data for research? We present a taxonomy of the ethical challenges facing researchers of OSNs and compare different approaches. We demonstrate how ethical considerations have been taken into account in previous studies that used fake identities. In addition, several possible approaches are offered to reduce or avoid ethical misconducts.

In what follows, we describe the present state of sustainable interaction design. We describe the potential role of interaction design in preparation for and adaptation to a post–tipping point world in terms of digital projects we may undertake for monitoring global conditions, setting public policies , and informing public behaviors, and in terms of arenas of potential effects and concern, such as water supplies, rebalancing of ecosystems, food supplies and food safety, dangers to habitations (especially coastal ones), health, and migration. We characterize computational concerns in the context of preparation and adaptation to climate change and note the similarities and differences with computational concerns targeted at inducing behavioral change to reduce greenhouse gases. the tipping Point The tipping point, by definition, is the point at which any efforts to stop something from happening arrive too late. According to the 2007 Nobel Prize–winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are at imminent risk of reaching a tipping point with respect to climate change and beyond the point at which even the very best case scenarios predict a certain unavoidable amount of climate change. The IPCC states: """" There is high confidence that neither adaptation nor mitigation alone can avoid all climate change impacts; however, they can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change.

Interrupting service can threaten lives and property; destroying information or changing it improperly can disrupt the work of governments and corporations; disclosing secrets can embarrass people or harm organizations. For us—as individuals or a nation—to become dependent on NISs, we want them to be trustworthy. That is, we want them to be designed and implemented so that not only do they work but also we have a basis to believe they will work, despite environmental disruption , human-user and operator errors, and attacks by hostile parties. Design and implementation errors must be avoided, eliminated, or the system must somehow compensate for them. Today's NISs are not very trustworthy. A recent Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) study (see www2.nas.edu/cstbweb/index.html) observed: • Little is known about the primary causes of NIS out-ages today. Moreover, few people are likely to understand an entire NIS much less have an opportunity to study several, and consequently there is remarkably poor understanding of what engineering practices actually contribute to NIS trustworthiness. • Available knowledge and technologies for improving trustworthiness are limited and not widely deployed. Creating a broader range of choices and more robust tools for building trustworthy NISs is essential. The study offers a detailed research agenda with hopes of advancing the current discussions about critical infrastructure protection from matters of policy, procedure , and consequences of vulnerabilities towards questions about the science and technology needed for implementing more-trustworthy NISs. Why is it so difficult to build a trustworthy NIS? First, the transformation of informal characterizations of system-level trustworthiness requirements into precise requirements that can be imposed on system components is beyond the current state of the art. Second, employing """" separation of concerns """" and using only trustworthy components are not sufficient for building a trustworthy NIS—interconnections and interactions of components play a significant role in NIS trustworthiness. One might be tempted to employ """" separation of concern """" and hope to treat each of the aspects of trustwor-thiness (such as, security, reliability, ease of use) in isolation.

In light of a building pro-choice counter-voice, this work contributes to a growing body of HCI research that takes an activist approach to design. We report findings from four design workshops with 31 pro-choice stakeholders across Ireland in which we positioned an exploratory protosite, HerStoryTold, to engender critical conversations around the use of sensitive abortion narratives as a tool for engagement. Our analysis shows how digital storytelling can help reject false narratives and raise awareness of the realities of abortion laws. It suggests design directions to curate narratives that provoke empathy, foster polyvocality, and ultimately expand the engaged community. Furthermore, this research calls for designers to actively support community mobilization through providing 'stepping stones' to activism.	her story;human–computer interaction;stepping level	Lydia Michie;Madeline Balaam;John C.

This workshop is intended to bring together individuals working on integrative models of human cognition, to emphasize shared motivations and goals.

In the present day, as well as in the future, knowledge and information are evermore closely tied to electronic data transfer. Finland’s newly published Cyber Security Strategy depicts how the government safeguards electronic data transfer, that is, information security against different threat and risk scenarios. Cyberspace has a human element and a technological element. It is a way to influence and affect society. It may be used to influence minds or to attack the physical world, for example by disrupting traffic control. But cyberspace cannot exist without people. The cyberspace offers the platform so called strategic communication. Strategic communication is a concept that unites the efforts of governmental organisations to influence people in support of national interests. Formal organisations and institutions are often seen as being opposed or resistant to change. Social Media and the cyber domain can offer many opportunities but also unknown threats and risks. In this paper we argue that securing an organisation is a living and continuously changing process. Deleuze and Guattari (1983) present the concept of a rhizome, meaning a dynamic weed formation which, opposed to the arboreal and hierarchical structure of the tree, involves spontaneous, unpredictable and distant connections between heterogeneous elements (Linstead & Thanem 2007, 1484) Strategic Communication is the focus of a heated discussion in the military field: How can militaries be credible and uphold the high standards of democracy within the asymmetric and complex battlefield? To be credible one must act according to what is said. The challenge is that the scene is global in the information age. The act, the actor, the scene, the purpose – all are exposed to a global audience through cyberspace on a very short notice. The most effective way of showing the scene and actors is an audiovisual product. Examples of this come from all conflict zones. Militaries are establishing Youtube channels and supplying material from intense fighting and frontline action. The solution for supporting the organisation’s own arguments has been the Combat Camera capability, in other words media-trained soldiers who are where the main effort is happening. Within the spirit of strategic communication, the cyber strategy itself is one way to operationalise cyber security by announcing measures to be taken against cyber attacks. In this article the authors reflect on the Finnish Cyber Strategy and Strategic Communications from a phenomenological perspective.

Two main and interrelated strands of evidence are presented: First, contrary to expectations that rising income per capita will tend to reduce wealth and wage disparities, the distribution of income and wealth both between countries and individuals has sharply skewed in the information age; second, knowledge production is a self-reinforcing cycle that tends to disproportionately reward some and exclude others. The so-called digital divide is as much a symptom and a cause of these broader techno-economic phenomena, and regarding it as a simple issue of connectivity is simplistic...

Is there something that could capture the imagination of a large number of us, leverage our talents and interests on a large scale, and result in something of truly global benefit? One answer would be to create systems that helped people better deliberate together to make better decisions. We’re already linked together—directly and indirectly— within communities and across political and other borders, but is it possible to collaborate more effectively, with less rancor and distrust? Using new technologies, would it be possible for us to deliberate more effectively, more equitably, and in vaster numbers, to address the problems that face us all? Like it or not, the ability to deliberate might be the key to humankind’s continuing existence. Sometimes people cannot or will not reason together, and the problems they could address (such as climate change) become worse. Wars, even, can be seen as the result of failed or thwarted deliberations. In a large sense, the lack of widespread and meaningful deliberation in society reveals a severely underdeveloped resource: humankind’s civic intelligence. The proposal discussed here, the World Citizen Parliament, is a call for action in the face of unprecedented opportunity and historical necessity.

We argue in this paper that these philosophical assumptions draw on the natural science tradition, and hence may not always be appropriate for inquiry into the relationships between information technology and people or + organizations. In particular, we suggest that the development and use of information technology within organizations is inherently processual and contextual, and that these characteristics are not always adequately captured by the philosophical assumptions prevalent in information systems research. Positing social process as central to information systems phenomena asserts the importance of studying the ongoing interactions among people, information technology and organizations, as these are situated historically and contextually. We argue in this paper that the dominant research perspective in information systems research is not well-equipped to deal with situated interactions over time, and propose additional research philosophies to augment the one currently favored by behavioral information systems researchers. We outline the features of such additionaI research perspectives, the interpretive and the critical, providing empirical examples to illustrate how and when they may be useful. We conclude that multiple research perspectives can usefully be employed within the inforrnation systems community to enrich understanding of behavioral information systems phenomena. Center for Digital Economy Research Stem School of Business IVorking Paper IS-90-04 Center for Digital Economy Research Stem School of Business IVorking Paper IS-90-04 INTRODUCTION One of the most pronounced features of contemporary social research and by this we mean those disciplines concerned with human phenomena (individual and collective) such as psychology, sociology, anthropology and their applied fields of administrative science, education, industrial psychology and industrial sociology is the great range of research perspectives or paradigms that operate concurrently [Astley & Van de Ven 1983; Burrell & Morgan 1979; Morgan 1980, 1983; Pfeffer 19821. These disciplines are marked by a plethora of """"schools of thought"""" each with its own metatheoretic assumptions, research methodologies and adherents. Given the complex and indeterminate nature of the social phenomena studied within these fields, the existence of a plurality of perspectives allows the exploration of diverse questions and hence adds breadth as well as depth to the knowledge generated. In behavioral information systems research however, such a diversity of research schools is not evident.1 In this paper we suggest that while no clear, collective theory binds the information systems discipline, there appears to be an implicit agreement among behavioral information systems researchers about the underlying nature of the phenomena to be investigated and what constitute appropriate research methods. In the next section we provide evidence for such a collective research tradition, and why we believe such a single philosophy towards studying behavioral information systems phenomena can be limiting. In the following two sections we explore two other philosophical traditions which we believe can supplement and enrich behavioral information systems research endeavors. We conclude with some general recommendations for the information systems community. A DOMINANT PERSPECTIVE IN BEHAVIORAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH Much recent self-reflection of the information systems discipline has involved a discussion of paradigm^,^ and the status of information systems research vis-8-vis the norms of what constitutes a scientific discipline [Benbasat 1985; Culnan 1986, 1987; Culnan & S wanson 1986; Hamilton & Ives 1982; Keen 1980; IUein & Welke 1982; Weber 19841. In all the above studies the focus has been on identifying and articulating theoretical commonalities or topic synthesis. The body of information systems research concerned with studying the interaction of information technology and humans at both micro and macro levels of analysis we shall refer to as """"behavioral information systems research."""" 2 The significance of paradigms for scientific activity has influenced much work in the history and philosophy of science [Bernstein 1978, 1985; Hacking 1981; Kuhn 1970; Ryan 1970, 19731. One definition given by Kuhn [1970:10] is that a paradigm includes """" ... law, theory, application, and instrumentation together ... [providing] models from which spring coherent traditions of scientific research."""" Center for Digital Economy Research Stem School of Business IVorking Paper IS-90-04 We argue, following Chua 119861 and Webster 22 Starbuck [I9881 however, that another indicator of a research tradition is the extent to which there exists a set of dominant philosophical assumptions or a world view that informs the work of the researchers in a discipline. Chua [1986:602] suggests that a community of scientists share """"... a constellation of beliefs, values, and techniques"""" and that these beliefs """" ... circumscribe definitions of 'worthwhile problems' and 'acceptable scientific evidence.""""' In the following section we show that the discipline of behavioral information systems research has indeed been guided by a dominant world view, and while this consensus has advanced research into certain kinds of information systems phenomena, we believe that it has also neglected others. As a consequence, this exclusive approach to information systems phenomena has """" ... limited the type of problems studied, the use of research methods, and the possible research insights that could be obtained"""" [Chua 1986:602]. Evidence of a Dominant Perspective in Behavioral Information Systems Research In a recent assessment of the published information systems literature, Culnan's [I9861 bibliographic citation analysis of information systems research publications (1972 to 1982), established nine distinct (and disparate) research areas in the information systems community. Further, Culnan [1987], again employing bibliographic citation analysis, identified five intellectual subfields within current information systems research, suggesting """"... that while MIS is still pre-paradigmatic, it has made progress, if one accepts the argument that MIS, like all social sciences, is a multiple paradigm discipline"""" [1987:347]. In this paper we wish to argue that while there may be no theoretical or topic congruence among information systems researchers, there is a consistent philosophical world view that underlies much of the activity constituting the field of behavioral information systems research, and that binds information systems researchers t~ge the r .~ To explore this assertion we examined the behavioral information systems literature published from January 1983 to May 1988 in four major infarmation systems outlets. These sources were: Communications of the ACM, Proceedings of the International Conference on Information System, Management Science, and MIS Q ~ r t e r l y . ~ Figure one displays the distribution of behavioral information systems research We specifically limit our remarks to behavioral information systems research, as we believe this is the subdiscipline that can most benefit from multiple philosophical approaches. We only examined mainstream American journals, as we believe that these represent the largest forum for publishing behavioral information systems research, and currently inform the majority of behavioral information system researchers. We acknowledge that by excluding the European journals we have limited the survey's exposure to nontraditional research work. Center for Digital Economy Research Stem School of Business IVorking Paper IS-90-04 published across these four sources. As we are concerned with research conduct, we excluded any conceptual or framework articles from consideration. A total of 155 empirical research articles were included in this analysis. -----Insert figure one here----The research articles were categorized along several different dimensions. The first used Culnan's [I9871 five topic-oriented research categories. These topic categories include research foundations, macro approaches to information systems, micro approaches to information systems, information systems management, and information systems curriculum. Culnan's foundation and curriculum categories were discarded as we were only concerned with empirical research. The distribution of articles by Culnan's categories is presented in figure two. This data confirms Culnan's [1986, 19871 conclusions in that, as in her studies, there does not appear to be one dominant theoretical paradigm, but rather several different and distinct streams of research. -----Insert figure two here----To explore the extent to which a dominant set of assumptions informs behavioral information systems research, we analyzed the sample in three different ways. The first is by research design, the second by time frame of the study, and finally by epistemology. A discussion of the consequences of our findings is deferred to the following section. Figure three presents the first breakdown showing the frequency of the various research designs. The three primary research designs which emerged from this analysis are case studies (13.5%), lab experiments (27.1%) and surveys (49.1%). These three designs account for almost 90% of the studies. Surveys, however, were clearly the dominant research method in this sample. -----Insert figure three here----The data was then analyzed by time period of the study. Four different categories were sufficient to classify the data.

While much of the research is no doubt too exploratory and tentative to be of direct relevance to practising lawyers, in other projects there is but a short step from the research laboratory to the marketplace. Given that most readers of this journal tend to be involved with, or interested in, research findings in the field, it might well be asked to what extent there should also be coverage here of commercial projects in artificial intelligence and law.	artificial intelligence and law;relevance	Richard E.

In particular, it focuses on a conceptual tension between the idea that disclosing personal information increases one’s autonomy and the idea that informational privacy is a condition for autonomous personhood. I argue that while self-tracking may sometimes prove to be an adequate method to shed light on particular aspects of oneself and can be used to strengthen one’s autonomy, self-tracking technologies often cancel out these benefits by exposing too much about oneself to an unspecified audience, thus undermining the informational privacy boundaries necessary for living an autonomous life.	autonomous robot;autonomy;information privacy;personally identifiable information	Marjolein Lanzing	2016	Ethics and Information Technology	10.1007/s10676-016-9396-y	computer science;quantified self;autonomy;sociology;transparency;social psychology;law	HCI	-73.74906963367704	-11.9538880144129	193365

The author attempts to construct such a „pragmatic“ ethical system (in an age of relativism and ethical scepticism) using concepts drawn from a number of moral philosophers. The global ethics construct uses the quality of human rationality as a basis, co-existing with the essence of „identity“ in religious, cultural, and personal terms for individuals. The potential of the constructed Internet „global citizen“ is unquantifiable, but the concept represents an opportunity for global co-operation and mingling of ideas, personalities, cultures, and solutions to problems. It is an unconstrained scenario utilising key qualities of the technology including rapid information turnaround and unprecented individual access by vast numbers of the global population.

84a92779566472dd6ce54c80b64ae830fa6b6eda	guide to digital forensics		This chapter introduces the concept of digital forensics and provides a discussion of what computer forensics is, examining data in order to reconstruct what happened in a digital environment. Further, the chapter discusses the steps involved in a forensic examination in a digital environment, from collecting evidence to reporting on the findings of the examination. Common constraints and processes handled during a forensics examination are also introduced. Emphasis is put on making the reader understand the reason for a computer forensic examination and the fact that computer forensics follows the same rules and regulations as traditional forensic disciplines. The fact that a forensic examination is commonly initiated for a reason, answering some question, is also described. The aim of the chapter is to provide the reader with a brief and nontechnical overview of the subject digital forensics. As such, the chapter can be read and understood without any technical knowledge.	computer forensics;digital environment	Joakim Kävrestad	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67450-6	computer security;digital forensics;computer forensics;computer science	Security	-71.94827132018862	-14.408695265017036	194543

693eb2b3d04bae56aeaf97c1ad5decb6cc445eab	refinements of a layered model for telecommunications policy		Inconsistencies within the various areas of telecommunications policy make for rich debate. For example, cable Internet service providers are not obligated to provide competing service providers with wholesale pricing for access to customers, while incumbent local exchange providers (specifically regional Bell operating companies) must provide such Internet access. Several authors have proposed models to resolve these inconsistencies; however, efforts to build a better policy mouse-trap continue to elude interested parties. While some claim that the existing title-based approach is not broken (and therefore should not be changed), others argue that the inconsistencies will lead to market distortions and slower deployment of broadband services. One proposed telecommunications policy model is based on a layered design similar to that used in the development of technical communications protocols. The consistency and modularity of such a policy approach may be a workable alternative to the current title-based policy; however, a layered model in and of itself is insufficient. A layered model solution must reflect the reality of network design, market power, and business arrangements, and, to be viable, it requires a transition policy to get there from the existing policy regime. Policy makers must understand the diversity of existing access technology (e.g., cable networks versus common carrier wireline networks), the disparity within industry segments (e.g., ILEC vs. CLEC use of last mile) and the strong influence of present policy on these various segments before implementing a transition to new policy.

Based on the party-state's decision on further economic liberalization in the new era, a commercial structure is becoming more common in the field of communication. The diffusion of economic reforms into media domain had been regarded as a force which would lead to the erosion of the Chinese Party's control over ideology. This article interrogates the way in which the sphere of production of Chinese television has been privatized in a post-WTO period. It argues that while the new media market initiates a redistribution of power and interests, the Chinese party-state is still able to effectively control the production and consumption of media messages within its nation, and an increase of commercialized operation of the television system does not necessarily lead to the weakening of the political function of Chinese television.	chinese room	Minghua Xu	2015	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2013.09.002	public relations;ideology;economics;marketing;advertising;television;management;law;china;economic system	NLP	-76.1070697603796	-10.534801161773238	196246

Here, we investigate scientific evolution through systematic analysis of a massive corpus of digitized English texts between 1800 and 2008. Our analysis reveals great predictability for long-prevailing scientific concepts based on the levels of their prior usage. Interestingly, once a threshold of early adoption rates is passed even slightly, scientific concepts can exhibit sudden leaps in their eventual lifetimes. We developed a mechanistic model to account for such results, indicating that slowly-but-commonly adopted science and technology surprisingly tend to have higher innate strength than fast-and-commonly adopted ones. The model prediction for disciplines other than science was also well verified. Our approach sheds light on unbiased and quantitative analysis of scientific evolution in society, and may provide a useful basis for policy-making.	biological evolution;body of uterus;entity name part qualifier - adopted;science of anatomy;text corpus	Jinhyuk Yun;Pan-Jun Kim;Hawoong Jeong	2015		10.1371/journal.pone.0117388	biology;medicine;paleoanthropology;evolutionary taxonomy;impact;writing;technology	HPC	-74.16833164921105	-14.251714922619229	196671
