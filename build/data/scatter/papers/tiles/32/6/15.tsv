This article extends a model, which m erges previous multi-issue and actor-focused method s, based on power relationships between stakeholders a nd their ability to bargain in order to increase th ir utility. The model has already used for assessing a public WLAN landscape. The article emphasizes the dynamic application of the model we developed for e xperimenting the negotiation evolution, shifting positions on some issues, and exchanging positions between actors. We also claim that such forecasting analyses of negotiation landscapes can be significa tly improved using more appropriate visualization support. We propose new visualization tools for ana lyzing negotiation outcomes, representing negotiati n landscapes, and applying what-if simulations, using passive influence, expected outcome and dissatisfaction, power distribution, proximity, and egotiation maps.	academy;ana (programming language);bargain buddy;bilateral filter;cartography;decision support system;delphi method;e-commerce;embarcadero delphi;expanded memory;francis h. harlow;futures and promises;geographic information science;geographic information system;google analytics;graphics;harris affine region detector;infographic;information systems;information visualization;internet access;john d. wiley;management information system;map;mental model;microcomputer;mitchell corporation;p (complexity);printed circuit board;printing;rationality;simulation;software management review;symposium on theory of computing;the magical number seven, plus or minus two;wisp;www	Samuel Bendahan;Giovanni Camponovo;Jean-Sébastien Monzani;Yves Pigneur	2005	J. of Management Information Systems		group decision-making;visualization;economics;forecasting;negotiation theory;knowledge management;scenario planning;artificial intelligence;marketing;operations management;management science;management;world wide web;negotiation;statistics	HPC	-70.61060705106676	0.33342813023565215	151702

ffa67601e8c3e3da0939610e8db19ff8ccda64e7	overcoming challenges to effective application of it research results: a framework for encapsulating the context and findings of research studies		Research studies frequently yield conflicting results. Resolving these conflicts is a grand challenge to effective application of research results. This paper presents a new framework for encapsulating the context and findings of research studies into a dimensional knowledge base which makes it easy to identify the conflicting results, and to explore the differences in context that might explain the conflicting findings. The framework is illustrated using the knowledge sharing domain. The Information Systems literature identifies over 100 variables associated with knowledge sharing, and the findings across different studies have frequently been contradictory. This paper shows how to capture the relevant contextual information, store the information in a dimensional document mart, and use the information to detect and reconcile seemingly inconsistent findings.	data mart;grand challenges;information system;knowledge base	Degan Kettles;Uday R.

One of the RPJMN focus is the development of rural and border areas brings a new paradigm for the village development. This village development paradigm change requires the support of village information system. Village Information System and Rural Areas (SIDeKa) has developed and implemented in dozens of villages in the some district as a pilot project. The transaction data and information in the village have captured accurately using SIDeKa. These data and information becoming crucial sources for development planning in the next phase. This paper describe design and build OLAP Business Intelligence for development planning at village and supra village (district) that integrates SIDeKa’s data from all villages and aligns the development planning with the vision, mission, and objectives of rural development. This paper presents model/architecture for ETL, star schema, and new measures that capture spatial and temporal dimensions. OLAP Business Intelligence will be useful for Village Sustainable Development Planning.	online analytical processing	Irya Wisnubhadra;Stephanie Pamela Adithama	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59111-7_46	architecture;process management;online analytical processing;rural area;business intelligence;development plan;business;sustainable development;information system;transaction data;knowledge management	AI	-70.49925571980606	2.911150504736046	154670

The sectoral statistics are the sum of statistics of companies in the respective sector. Usually, all sectors have the same set of inputs for producing outputs. For example, they have labour, capital and intermediate as input and amount of production as output. We can apply traditional DEA models for evaluation of efficiency regarding all sectors by means of these common input and output factors. However, there remain some insecure feelings in comparing all sectors as a scratch race. Some sectors are in fields with matured technologies, while others are in emerging fields. Some are labour intensive, while others are capital intensive. These situations lead us to compare sectors under a handicap race. In this paper, we propose a new DEA	aggregate data;disk sector;emergence;input/output;printing;tone mapping	Kidanemariam Berhe Hailu;Kaoru Tone	2017	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-016-2225-1	economics;operations management;economy;labour economics	DB	-73.49980681875535	-1.3315291808038476	156673

As guest editors for this special issue and as practicing grounded theorists, we feel that the nature of GTM is often misunderstood and its label abused in different ways. Therefore, in this editorial article, we attempt to clarify what we see as the#R##N#essential characteristics of GTM. We also present some issues that are commonly discussed among grounded theorists, but which are less well known publicly. We argue that GTM can be a powerful tool for IS scholars interested in theory development, allowing researchers to conduct pioneering research with both flexibility and rigour. This argument is illustrated by the seven papers that we have selected for this special issue. These papers represent the wide variety of ways in which GTM can be used in our field.#R##N#Further, they show how, through innovative uses of GTM, IS researchers can address some long-standing research challenges.

Design/methodology/approach – Research on which the paper is based focused on exploration of classical systems approaches to the design of complex socio-technical systems in which ownership, power, control and management of structure and benefit generation and distribution are distributed, dynamic and multi-constituent. Support for development of these four extensions to Ashby’s Law comes from observation of four decades of socio-technical systems development along with critical thinking that combined systems analysis theories with theories and findings from fields of hegemonic analysis, design research, management, management information systems, behaviour in organisations and sociology. Findings – The paper outlines application of four new extensions to LoRV in relation to unplanned changes in distributions of power, ownership, control, benefit generation and benefit distribution in complex socio-technical systems/digital eco-systems in the built environment that are emergent or have changing structures. Three of these extensions have been outlined earlier in relation to the design of learning object-based e-learning systems. The fourth extension builds on these via application of Coasian analysis. The paper also describes a suite of five guidelines to assist with the design of complex socio-technical systems derived from the four extensions to Ashby. Research limitations/implications – The four extensions of Ashby’s Law that underpin the design guidelines in this paper are deduced from observation and critical analysis rather than being “proven” empirically. They are derived from observation of the behaviour of real-world complex systems together with critical analytical thinking that integrated theory and research findings from a range of disciplines where each informs understanding of hegemonic aspects of emergent complex socio-technical systems involving multiple, changing constituencies, and evolving system structures. Practical implications – A design method is derived comprising five design guidelines for use in pre-design and design of complex socio-technical systems/digital eco-systems in the built environment. Originality/value – The paper describes the application of four new extensions to LoRV that extend the analytical role of Ashby’s Law in diagnosis of changes in power relations and unintended design outcomes from changes in the generation and control of variety in complex, multi-layered and hierarchical socio-technical systems that have multiple stakeholders and constituencies. From these, a suite of five new design guidelines is proposed.	balance of power;complex systems;ecosystem;email;emergence;engineering design process;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interaction;management information system;mathematical optimization;object-based language;sociotechnical system;software development process;theory;variety (cybernetics)	Terence Love;Trudi Cooper	2007	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684920710827391	simulation;cybernetics;design methods;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics	HCI	-74.4674916032076	-1.5229216026061903	158305

Using the lens of the classical ethical theories in philosophy, this paper revisits key areas of KM—knowledge creation, storage and access, transfer, and application—and generates relevant research questions in each of these areas. The paper highlights the importance of examining ethical issues related to KM, and offers an illustrative set of ethically-informed research themes and questions that can potentially be investigated by future studies.	futures studies;knowledge management;theme (computing);theory	Sutirtha Chatterjee;Suprateek Sarker	2013	J.

Since June 2009, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has required all listed companies to provide their financial reports in XBRL. Similarly, from 2011 all German companies will be mandated to use XBRL in the context of reporting to tax authorities. The growing importance of XBRL is the motivation for this paper, exploring the progress of research conducted in the XBRL domain. The results of this study show that the majority of the 57 analyzed XBRL-related academic papers adopt an empirical research design, with researchers using methods such as descriptive statistical analyses, interviews, and case studies to analyze the international acceptance and adoption of XBRL as a financial reporting standard. The paper provides a comprehensive and structured overview of current XBRL research and delivers recommendations for future research topics for both the academic and practitioner communities. This paper also identifies the lack of an integrated, data-oriented, and technical approach in current global XBRL research which is necessary to meet the requirements of financial reporting in the future and to which Business and Information Systems Engineering (BISE) may contribute.	computer security;database;information systems;relevance;requirement;systematic review;systems engineering	André Gräning;Carsten Felden;Maciej Piechocki	2011	Business & Information Systems Engineering	10.1007/s12599-011-0169-1	accounting;public relations;quantitative research;marketing;information system	DB	-76.65901554896442	-0.06357346464309126	160521
cda2fc7137528ce7409ad928a4eb7eb9d7e64d98	the effects of enterprise portals on knowledge management projects	knowledge management	In an attempt to consolidate various departmental intranets, organizations are constructing corporate intranets or portals (Choo, Detlor, & Turnbull, 2000). They are becoming single points of entry through which users and communities can perform their business tasks, and also evolving into virtual places where people can get in touch with other people who share common interests. Due to this evolution from intranets towards portals, many organizations are using them as the major technological infrastructure of their knowledge management (KM) initiatives. KM studies analyze people, organizations, processes and technology. Although technology is not the main component of KM, it would be naive to implement KM without considering any technological support. KM is of particular relevance to information science and information system research because technologies play a critical role in shaping organizational efforts for knowledge creation, acquisition, integration, valuation, and use (Sambarmurthy & Subramani, 2005). The purpose of this article is to present a model which may be useful to help organizations in understanding the impacts of portal initiatives on KM initiatives. The research model, that is presented a little later, was based on TAM (technology acceptance model), TTF (task technology fit) and knowing organization model (Choo, 1998), and was tested in 98 Brazilian and 70 Portuguese organizations.	ibm tivoli access manager;information system;intranet;knowledge management;noise shaping;portals;relevance;test template framework;value (ethics)	Rodrigo Baroni de Carvalho;Marta Araújo Tavares Ferreira;Chun Wei Choo;Ricardo Vidigal da Silva	2007			integrated enterprise modeling;personal knowledge management;organizational learning;technology acceptance model;digital firm;knowledge management;enterprise portal;enterprise software;business;information science	Web+IR	-75.57315590219578	2.98197150522278	160873

With fast development of electronic commerce and fierce competition in the third party payment market, the central bank of China sets about granting profession licenses to related companies. This paper theoretically analyses the third party payment’s development situation, operation mode and operation feature, and then offers strategies to develop China’s third party payment. As a separate operating agency, the third party payment platform, acting as intermediation in the process of dealing under the supervision of banks and business management departments, provides secure guarantee and technological support to the two trading parties. The platform, also acting as witness and channel of the network transaction, offers abundant payment means and reliable service to customers decreases the possibility of fraudulent trade and relieves public worries on the security of network transaction. The platform of third party payment was investment hotspot of the year 2005, which is called """"on-line payment year"""". Due to relaxed qualification cognizance, small payment companies sprang up and the scale of platform increased by 100 percent a year. According to IReserach’s investigation, the third party payment in 2004 is 2.3 billion RMB, while the number was more than 30 billion RMB in 2006 and with an expectation of 280 billion RMB in 2010. It is said that the People’s Bank of China sets about granting license to the third party payment companies which means 80 percent small ones will be eliminated, thus perfecting operation mode becomes the most important issue for this industry. 580 Yong Jin, Wei Song, Jingyi Zhang 1. Development situation of China third party payment The 21st century is an era of information with thorough development of computer and network technology, and EC stride ahead in this era. Meanwhile multitudinous information technology enterprises, venture investment companies, and production circulation enterprises involve in the field of EC. Realized high growth of 73.7% in 2004, the EC market paced into its steady growth stage since 2005, with a transaction sum 680 billion (increased by 41.7%) and 1020 billion in 2006(increased by 50%). Fig. 1. Recent Development Tendency of China EC Nowadays, two methods are widely used in the EC payment, one is electronic bank service and the other is the third party electronic payment service. According to the report of Ireserach, in China, 97% electronic payment is on-line payment, while only 3 percent is paid in form of mobile or telephone payment. All these prove that, in spite of the existence of immaturity and relaxed cooperation in this industrial chain, great achievement has been gained and on-line payment has been playing the most important role in the field of electronic payment. As to present case, on-line banks mainly deal with payments among enterprise (B2B), especially large and medium sized enterprises, whose sums of transacted money are large and their business partners are relatively stable, thus their interior ERP systems or self-constructed platforms are able to deal with the payments. As for the domain of small–sum payments, such as B2C and C2C, services provided by single on-line bank could not satisfy the changing and flexible demands of smallsized customers. Similarly advanced technologies and costly maintenance expenses are beyond small-scaled network and business’s management. Under such situation, the third party payment platform, a non-bank investment institution that is independent from both the payer and the payee, becomes a hot spot in the market of on-line payment. From 2001 to 2004, its annual compound growth rate is by 44.2 percent. By 2004, China’s third party payment increased to 2.3 million RMB. On Developing China’s Third Party Payment 581 2. The Third Party’s Payment Modes The third party’s payment mode can roughly divided into two kinds: One acts as bank gateway proxy which provides many bank connections to the users; the other acts as transaction intermediary (whose main function is to bridge the buyer and the sell, and also connect the EC platform and the bank) to realize on-line fund transaction. 2.1 The Mode of Payment Gateway From the whole process, the payment gateway mode can be regarded as a channel which links multi-banks and treaty-signed merchants, the buyer pays the seller indirectly through the third party payment platform and the third party provides compatible connection platform to the sellers. Fig. 2. Illustration of Payment Gateway Mode Fig. 3. Illustration of Credit Intermediary Mode 2. 2 The Mode of Credit Intermediary In order to increase two sides’ credit, ensure well circulation to fund and cargo, the third party payment service, acting as the credit intermediary, arises at the historic moment, implements """"receiving and paying on other's behalf """" and """"the credit Buyer"""	e-commerce;erp;emergence;enterprise resource planning;entry point;hotspot (wi-fi);iota and jot;online and offline;payment gateway;qualification problem;secure mobile payment service;single sign-on	Yong Jin;Wei Song;Jingyi Zhang	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-75466-6_66	payment order;electronic money;payment service provider;chinese financial system;business;economic policy;commerce	ECom	-73.20974378259473	3.5937939104750045	162102

In particular, little is known about complexity beyond technical and process levels, and how such complexity impacts design activity. In this paper we construct a model of MSD based on the formulation of the broader concept of context complexity. This concept, which subsumes but also transcends technical and process complexity, is used to explain design strategies and their consequences. We identify four design contexts that explain, and are also explained by, complexity. These contexts map out the ‘landscape for action’ over which design activity takes place. They shape the design environment and the responses taken to it. We use a grounded theory approach to study what designers actually do (as opposed to theorising what they should do). We argue that a better understanding of context determined and context determining strategies better informs interventions aimed at improving MSD design practice. Our main conclusion is that interventions should be directed to those situations where there is a mismatch between the level of complexity in the design context and the level of complexity in the design strategy taken in response to that context. We call these situations ‘breakdown’ contexts and examine their causes and consequences in greater detail. Our claimed contribution is to broaden the concept of design breakdowns through a specific understanding of the role and impact of (context) complexity in MSD.

Due to their overall responsibility, managers are particularly affected by this situation. Information systems (IS) that aim at helping managers are known as management support systems (MSS). They are designed to serve as their central, hands-on, day-to-day source of information [1]. MSS design currently entails two interesting aspects. Taking the 2008/2009 economic crisis as our reference point, we firstly examine a new orientation of the corporate management task and its implications for the (functional) MSS design [2]. Secondly, digital natives increasingly populate organizations’ management along with digital immigrants. The latter have learned to engage with IS and developed into MSS users over the years [3]. These new-generation managers more naturally accept MSS, but have higher (non-functional) expectations about how IS should accommodate their user preferences [4]. The objective of this article is to examine the changing IS requirements for a new MSS architecture design, implement and evaluate it with the prototype on hand.	digital native;hands-on computing;information systems;information source;population;prototype;requirement;user (computing)	Jörg H.

In order to make it possible, it is required to develop comprehensive, integrated and progressive environmental policies. These environmental policies would maintain dynamic environmental equilibrium. Today there is requirement by the National and International bodies to have standardised environmental management systems (EMS). These systems would keep the records of all environmental issues pertaining to the organisation. The EMS is made simple through the introduction of the ISO 14000 series. ISO 14000 provides guidelines on how to successfully manage and reduce environmental impacts through management functions, while at the same time allowing for high levels of socioeconomic growth and dedication to sustainable development. The implementation of EMS through ISO 14000 series would involve the expenditure. Every organisation is interested in economic aspects before the implementation of any system. They want that the system should provide the financial benefits, which will motivate to keep going on. This paper discusses economic aspects for the implementation of ISO 14000 an EMS tool in any organization with the help of cost of environment concept. The paper presents the concept of quality cost being applied to justify the implementation of EMS.	environmental resource management;management system	S. B. Jaju;R. P.

This paper focuses on risk assessment. After providing a brief conceptual definition of risk, the paper reviews the empirical literature in order to identify the main undesirable outcomes that may result from an IT outsourcing deal. It then uses transaction cost and agency theory as a primary theoretical basis, and proposes a framework for categorizing risk factors which have been identified in the literature.

Information technology and its many applications such as electronic data transfer has accelerated the globalisation and integration of markets and given rise to more complicated and sophisticated supply chain solutions.

On this basis, the authors investigate the challenges that will impact the implementation of human resources management in companies as a cybernetic system. Because there exists a two-way link between the companies and the environment, this contribution also illustrates the link in the other direction and shows how a company can gain competitive advantage by effective human resources management. The point is that companies are moving from being knowledge-based to being creativity-based to be sustainable and innovative businesses. They need requisite holism in their conception and cybernetics in their action to succeed in this complex move. We suggest a cybernetic model aimed at meeting this need.			2005	Cybernetics and Systems	10.1080/01969720590887298	knowledge base;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;human resource management;management science;competitive advantage	OS	-77.3515224201772	2.277495928710439	167822
91fa616eb751e50dc6f721f7a643f2320bff018c	ict standard setting today: a system under stress		"""The modern standards development infrastructure is largely the product of the industrial age, and evolved to address the needs of such an economy. The requirements of a world that is increasingly based upon information and communications technology, however, are far different, and include demands for faster standards development, less vulnerability to uncooperative owners of necessary patent claims, and a greater need for universal, global adoption of core enabling standards. These needs have been partially addressed through several organic developments, such as the proliferation of consortia, the evolution of more detailed intellectual property rights policies, and the passage of the World Trade Organization's Technical Barriers to Trade Act. But the advent of the Internet and the Web, and the continuing introduction of new ICT-based products and services in ever shorter and more frequent product cycles, are exposing the fact that a system that retains strong roots in the 19 century is ill-suited to meet the demands of the 21. In this article, I survey some of the areas of inadequacy inherent in the current system, the ways in which society is being impacted by new standards-dependent technologies, and the situations in which governments may feel called upon to intervene. Introduction: For most of the first hundred years of the modern era of standard setting, standards developers focused their attention on the attributes of tangible objects. The standards they developed specified dimensions, materials and other physical attributes, and to the extent that they addressed intangibles, those elements were result-oriented, such as performance and safety. Similarly, interoperability standards were physical standards, intended to ensure that part A would fit with part B. These standards were created by domain experts, and by interested parties within the market niches that produced the products involved. Usually, problems requiring standards solutions could be addressed within a single standard setting organization (SSO). In a world of physical objects, standards development could conveniently lag product development. Only after screws, steam power and electric lights had proven to be popular did a demand develop for standards to establish common thread gauges, boiler safety guidelines, and light socket dimensions. Even in the case of networks, the same held true, as railroads, power companies and telephone services were all launched as local enterprises, using available proprietary implementations. Not until these discrete networks were joined did the need for nationwide interoperability standards arise. Such after the fact, non-urgent standard setting could, and sometimes did, have advantages. For example, products that were inherently well designed and successful were more likely to become the models for de facto or de jure standards. Similarly, when cycles of innovation are widely spaced and their results long lasting (Edison's light bulbs, in comparison to yesterday's floppy disks, remain in use today), taking time to achieve the best standards result represents a wise investment, due to the length of time that the market will be """"locked in"""" by the decisions made. Due to communication, travel and trade constraints, among other causes, most of the SSOs that were founded to meet evolving standards needs were national in scope (with notable exceptions, such as the International Telecommunication Union, or ITU). But after the Second World War, the internationalization of standards increased under the auspices of several global standards bodies that were formed in addition to the ITU, most notably the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). But domestic standards can be used to protect domestic manufacturers from the competition presented by foreign goods, and at times this provided a disincentive to locally implement useful standards, even after a global authority had adopted them."""	floppy disk;intel edison;internet;interoperability;new product development;requirement;single sign-on;subject-matter expert;world wide web	Andrew Updegrove	2007	First Monday		economics;operations management;economy;law;commerce	Web+IR	-73.25954116369167	3.661539503215814	168087

The price paid to private companies for these solutions and the cost incurred from their inefficiency constitute a gross and appalling waste of public resources. We propose to bootstrap a change in IT policy by having heads of department hire IT workers ; we give advice to the central decision making body on how to incentivize them.

In particular, we illustrate how HRT can contribute to the analysis of the risks associated with the Incident Management process at the IT department of a large European financial institution. We examine the characteristics of an organizational context that favor high reliability of IT processes. Through a detailed analysis of interactive complexity and tight-coupling as determinants of reliability, and based on empirical qualitative data, we are able to propose solutions and techniques to deal with risk. Based on these findings, we argue that HRT may indeed serve as a suitable theoretical framework for conducting comprehensive risk analysis and management.	it risk management;incident management	Gerd Van Den Eede;Bartel Van de Walle;Anne-Françoise Rutkowski	2006	Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)	10.1109/HICSS.2006.112	qualitative property;risk analysis;risk management;reliability theory;coupling;knowledge management;environmental resource management;management science;information management;management;system testing;operational risk;emergency management	SE	-74.63817907213	-0.20018972440915173	168874

We argue that the Institute for Research on Learning (IRL), a spin-off of Xerox PARC, proved instrumental in enrolling CoPs into the knowledge management (KM) discipline. IRL objectified, packaged, and made a business out of CoPs. CoPs in KM are now a formalized process coupled with technological artifacts to build groups of people who effectively share knowledge across boundaries. Drawing from participant observations, archival documents, and interviews with KM practitioners in the aerospace industry as well as key players of IRL, our research seeks to unveil the invisible history that the popularization of a theory can often obscure. We argue that CoPs provide a case study for understanding how abstract concepts in science are strategically and subconsciously reified, or made objects of inquiry, and appropriated by actors. This reification of a “soft” science blurs the line between theory and technology.	action theory (philosophy);archive;artificial intelligence;bionic commando: rearmed;c object processor;cops (software);categorization;computer-supported cooperative work;connascence (computer programming);digital history;distortion;high availability;ibm notes;judy array;knowledge management;reification (computer science);reification (knowledge representation);relevance;situated;social reality;universal instantiation;well-posed problem	Norman Makoto Su;Hiroko Wilensky;David F.

Based on content analysis of semi-structured interviews and networks maps with self-employed migrants from the former Soviet Union in Germany this study identified four empirically grounded types of migrant transnational entrepreneurial activities and analysed transnational networking strategies for each type. The study demonstrates that different types of social capital are mobilised for different types of transnational business strategies, with intensive transnational entrepreneurial activities requiring larger pre-existing networks in the country of origin of both strong and weak ties, that are gradually extended, while a more limited set of mostly informal weak ties suffice for more sporadic transnational activities in the country of origin. Transnational entrepreneurial activities with other countries or with multiple countries, on the other hand, involved a more formal network of relationships. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Online business will continue to grow; however, in the digital world where almost every organization is present online, the critical success factors for surviving on the market are more than needed. The purpose of the research is thus to study the factors influencing the success/failure of local online platforms’ providers in competition with global providers. The fact that some local providers are even market leaders in a local environment while many others have failed implies that there exist some specific factors determining the success of global competitor in a local market. The study will present a valuable opportunity particularly for new companies or existing companies that are deciding about launching new online services in order to judge whether there is a potential for their service on the market and which factors they should consider before starting the competition with global market leaders.	e-services;existential quantification;failure	Anton Manfreda;Peter Trkman;Ales Groznik;Jure Erjavec	2017				Web+IR	-75.90749181166235	3.4815914908307457	171522

In this paper we take a closer look at one of the primary issues raised when supporting the management of knowledge how to understand the role of knowledge classification and codification as means for further organisational learning and innovation. Two manufacturing cases are analysed using particular perspectives from current theories on classification, the management of knowledge and organisational innovation. It is concluded that a more complex understanding of the interplay between cognitive and community models for knowledge management as informed by research on social processes of classification can inform our understanding of both the role of classification of knowledge for organisational innovation and on the viability of providing ICT support based on codified knowledge.	cognition;cognitive model;communications of the acm;computer-supported cooperative work;coppersmith–winograd algorithm;embedded system;emergence;european conference on information systems;expert system;humans;information system;interactivity;knowledge management;maxine;organizational behavior;situated;strategic management;theory;windows aero	Carsten Sørensen;Ulrika Lundh Snis	2001	JIT	10.1080/026839600110054771	organizational learning;knowledge economy;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;body of knowledge;knowledge engineering;management information systems;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;management;information technology;information system;domain knowledge	AI	-71.20946140122943	1.7702681783774818	173923

A new generation of the e-government domain is gradually emerging, referred to as u0027e-government 3.0u0027, which aims at the exploitation of the large quantities of data possessed by government agencies, possibly in combination with data from the private sector, using advanced modelling and analysis techniques, in order to support and improve policy making, and promote u0027evidence-based policyu0027 making. This paper makes a contribution towards the development of public sector data science and policy analytics, focusing on a highly important problem: the economic crises, which occur repeatedly in market-based economies. It presents a methodology for the exploitation of government data from Taxation Authorities and Statistical Agencies, in combination with data from the private sector (from business information and consulting firms), for the identification of firmu0027s characteristics that affect behavior in the economic crisis, focusing on their investment related behavior (the extent of reduction of their investment). Our methodology aims to support the design of public policies for reducing the negative impact of economic crises on firmsu0027 investment, and improving firmsu0027 investment behavior during economic crises. An application of this methodology is presented, using data from Greek firms for the crisis period 2009 -- 2014, which leads to interesting insights; four firmsu0027 characteristics have been identified that reduce the negative effects of the crisis on Greek firmsu0027 investment.

The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is vital to the survival of any economy. ICT involves innovations in microelectronics, computing (hardware and software), telecommunications, semiconductors, and fiber optics, etc. Technological innovations, such as the wide diffusion of mobile phones and wireless Internet, play a paramount role in building ICT levels globally. With an emphasis on the Chinese economy, this paper discusses the issues and challenges involved in ICT investments and further explore factors that influence ICT policy formulation and how these factors impact on the implementation. Future infrastructure expenditure needs and financing options and the practical framework needed to develop the strategies to build ICT infrastructure are also presented.	chinese room;emergence;itil;internet;job stream;mobile phone;optical fiber;semiconductor	Somasheker Akkaladevi;Xin Luo	2008			computer science;knowledge management;information infrastructure;e-commerce;the internet;information society;technological change;information technology;information and communications technology;social change	HCI	-73.82566181974563	1.8821825701520112	176636
2f4cdc1f9e4e436eb41d6acee6cbaee43533d145	business process management practices in a small transition economy: current status and research opportunities		The main objective of this research is to contribute to an improved understanding of BPM practices in transition economies. The paper offers an overview of the key motives for BPM implementation within different business processes and across industry sectors, as currently practiced by 240 (large and small) companies in a small transition economy of Bosnia & Herzegovina. Being the first of its kind for this particular country, this research also contributes to an important body of knowledge on BPM in transition economies of a particular type. Our research also identifies an important limitation of prior research in this area, where BPM studies are often de-contextualized from their very unique context of transition economies. Consequently, we propose to expand the current research on BPM in transition economies to include further research on BPM for transition economies.

This paper assumes that literature reviews, which represent a powerful instrument for the identification and synthesis of knowledge, have not tapped their full potential to address this issue due to deficiencies in methodology. The analysis of 18 literature reviews published in pertinent academic outlets during the past 20 years shows such deficiencies. Two of the most critical weaknesses identified are (1) the lack of theory use in most reviews and (2) a weak linkage of reviews, resulting in little progress in theory and framework development. The systematic identification of these weaknesses and the extraction of promising methodological examples from past literature are the main contributions of this work, which supports the composition of more effective literature reviews in future research.	linkage (software);relevance	Guido Schryen	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14874-3_10	business value;management science;operations research;information system	HCI	-76.6755929393722	-1.630606398952543	178809

Bond defaults, credit (loan) defaults, firm defaults and country defaults are examples of this kind. The scope and reason for existence of this study is to focus mainly on firm default. The purpose of this review is to shed light on the development and evaluation of the models proposed for predicting bankruptcy in terms of conceptualization, country distribution, sector specification, time dimension, variables used and findings reported. The current review includes firm default studies published in business fields such as accounting, economics, finance and management science. This review is distinct in that it seeks (i) to give a comprehensive examination of the models, (ii) to compare and contrast the features of the models and (iii) to show with a solid argument where future research should be focused.

While corporations developing technology usually pursued increased efficiency in production, the UTOPIA-project aimed at other, alternative goals such as translating social values regarding job skills, quality of work, and quality of products into new computer hardware and software for the graphic industries. In the larger context, the UTOPIA-project can be seen as an attempt by the labor movement to revitalize and realize the old dream of industrial democracy by designing computing technology.	computer hardware;project xanadu;value (ethics)	Per Lundin	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-23315-9_21	operations management;political science;socioeconomics;management	HCI	-73.41295338253397	-1.5447496775471041	179176

There must be some way to systematically assess the risk to critical infrastructures. Work began two decades ago (1980s) on a comprehensive theoretical framework to model and identify risks to large-scale and complex systems. The framework, hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM) (Y.Y. Haimes, 1981; 1998) is to conventional modeling schemes what holography is to conventional photography. Holography captures images in three dimensions, as compared with conventional photography's two-dimensional, planar representation. Likewise, HHM endorses a gestalt and holistic philosophy, which allows it to capture more dimensions than modeling schemes that yield planar models. HHM promotes a systemic process that identifies most, if not all, important and critical sources of risk.	complex systems;gestalt psychology;holism;holography;information system;interconnectedness	Thomas A.

Yet, the successful migration to value-added alliances is blended in the right combination of organizational, legal, economic, socio-cultural, and technical factors, and requires further research into innovative business models. These models should leverage existing SME competences and transcend existing virtual collaboration barriers and limitations.

Often, the professional organisers of awareness activities are also uncertain about best practice in electronic commerce awareness creation. Thus, although a number of initiatives have taken place in Europe they have failed to produce the expected results. In this paper we describe how a project funded by the European Commission (WeCAN) defined and evaluated a number of awareness models in electronic commerce in order to support organisations involved in awareness creation such as chambers of commerce, consulting companies and higher educational institutes.	best practice;e-commerce	Anastasia Papazafeiropoulou;Athanasia Pouloudi;Georgios I.

As a result, US businesses are pursuing a global Web presence at an increasing rate in recognition of the huge global market external to it. Along with the opportunities in the international marketplace, there are complexities associated with the diversity of religion, culture, and language. There are also complexities associated with local differences in computing technologies used to access the Internet. An exploratory case study was conducted using seventeen e-businesses in the US to assess the state of Web usability from a localization perspective. The findings are summarized in terms of potential barriers uncovered during the use of a Web usability assessment model as a framework for evaluating localized sites. Several Web usability factors from the model, design layout, information content, and performance, were used to uncover design and technological issues that might impede the widespread use of localized Web sites.	complexity;internet;self-information;unreachable memory;web presence;web usability	Shirley Ann Becker	2002	J.

Through case narratives we demonstrate issues that can arise and using the four theoretical viewpoints of sociotechnology, knowledge management, organisational communication theory, and Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) we develop practical insights into the organisational complexity of computer-supported and virtual teamwork. This complexity, we argue, requires a novel combination of work design factors including participation-related design and computer-supported tools. The outcome is improved communication and a fuller application of organisational knowledge that enhances the design and operation of co-operative work. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This contrasts starkly with a growing concern of practitioners who have come to regard IIS as a double threat: They are often vitally critical for the globally oriented firm, but at the same time they are perceived as difficult and risky. Previous research is reviewed and classified by research domain. The areas of importance for practitioners are less well researched than others, A theory building methodology is discussed and recommended for an initial research project. To give focus to the method a ‘seed’ concept is proposed as a starting point and validated on three case vignettes from the author’s own experience. The implication of the concept for the development and implementation of IIS are discussed and a direction for future research is indicated.	information systems;information system;international standard book number;internet information services;sparse matrix;tree accumulation	Hans P.

Ultimately, these professionals serve as a bridge between the organization's technical and management communities. Today, the IS discipline stands at a crossroads. Despite a strong global demand for IS graduates and a growing demand for unbiased research relevant to the application of information technology within the firm, the IS discipline faces declining university enrollments, engages in scholarly debates about the relevance and identity of IS research, and seeks remedies to address the needs of the global IT worksforce.	business process;information system;relevance	Don Hardaway;Richard G.

Data has been collected through a case study on shared services in the Australian fi-nancial services industry and DNDs (dependency network diagrams) employed to analyze the complex web of dependencies associated with the collabora-tion. The paper suggests that it is not sufficient to consider a collaboration in isolation. In particular it is noted that a change affecting one dependency may trigger a compounding and cumulative interaction with other dependencies. DNDs also surface details of the governance control associated with each de-pendency and the availability of alternative part-ners-enabling an organization to assess the risk associated with each dependency. Finally, a weak-ness of DNDs is noted; specifically that they are static and are unable to capture the dynamics of de-veloping dependencies in inter-organizational collaboration.	diagram;earthbound;libreoffice;shared services;the australian	Mark Borman;Frank Ulbrich	2011	2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2011.295	public relations;interview;financial services;computer science;organization;knowledge management;information management;management;world wide web;commerce;cumulant;collaboration	SE	-73.98604726597588	0.7599970459695257	185932
7662c6fff8d40cacdc83a51237436b42f80562ba	the impact of non-technical factors on information technology strategy and e-business	it strategy;information technology;e business	IT strategy and E-business has come to stay as important issues in many organisations. They are developed and implemented for the main purpose of improving, supporting and enabling their business goals and objectives. These requirements for support and enablement of the IT strategy and E-business are increasingly present in many organisations. IT strategy and E-business are breaking old barriers and building new interconnections in what is referred to by many specialists as the emerging Global Village. IT is bringing business communities and the world at large, closer, and making the global village smaller. This paper is focused on influencing factors, whether on the development or on the implementation of IT strategy and E-business within the computing environment of an organisation. One important outcome is the new role of knowledgeable workers (people factor) and involvement in the implementation of IT strategy and E-business in organisation.

The authors try to deal with particular methodological and applied aspects inherent in the analysis of data from the interaction of man‐Internet (Web‐mining). The research methodology of this work will be focused on a prevalent optic multidisciplinary research based on the pillars of data mining and Web mining. The explosion of Internet and electronic commerce has made the most of business to have its own website. A company may engage internal costs for the development and operation of their website. The website can be designed for internal access (in which case it can be used for presentation and data storage company poli‐ cies with references of customers) or for external access (they are created and used for promotional and advertis‐ ing products and services company). The objective of this research, primarily concerns the definition of a reper‐ toire of tools in analyzing e‐business through the development process for web‐usage mining; 2nd objective is ori‐ ented to management, recognizing and evaluating the web‐sites in accountancy, as property intangible, which is a special case and very little studied in economic literature financial specialty, the authors try to achieve a national and  international accounting  treatment of  the creation and development of web‐sites. This paper  is  intended  to have a predominantly interdisciplinary character, trying to connect decision theory viewpoint of knowledge, the theme of the interaction between humans and Internet and particularly in evaluating their in accounting firm. We chose  this  theme  in an effort  to  tell us more about electronic commerce, especially  the way  this activity can be managed, evaluated and accounted, considering its importance for both the dealer (who is trying to promote and sell their products using a minimum cost), but also for the client (which, besides the fact that they can save time, have the opportunity and price comparison quality products on the market).	comparison shopping website;computer data storage;data mining;decision theory;e-commerce;internet authentication service;web mining	I.

To illustrate the usefulness of the framework and criteria, I show how they can be employed to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of a theory which, based upon citation evidence, has had a significant impact on other researchers within the information systems discipline. Because the evaluation of existing theories often provides the basis for refining existing theories or building new theories, I also show how the framework and criteria can be used to inform the development of high-quality theory.	information system;theory	Ron Weber	2012	J.

Two dynamic modelling paradigms were considered for development of a collaborative planning support system (CPSS). One paradigm is based on negative feedback, which forces system transformation towards an external goal. The selected paradigm is based on the concept of positive feedback. Positive feedback behaves in a similar manner to many natural growth processes in which the system feedback instigates growth away from an external goal or reference point. The positive feedback approach initiates changes to a proposal away from the initial reference point of conflict or disjoint value systems. This approach forms the basis of a framework for decision support system development. The decision support system is designed for interaction and participation of a group of stakeholders with a project proponent for the purpose of examining options for hydropower generating station configuration.

During the nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as mass, energy, work, and power. During the twentieth century, the information revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as binary digit or bit, binary coding, and algorithmic complexity. Here, we propose an abstraction for the twenty-first century, in which there is an emerging revolution in thinking about business and economics based on a service-dominant logic. The worldview of service-dominant logic stands in sharp contrast to the worldview of the goods-dominant logic of the past, as it holds service—the application of competences for benefit of others—rather than goods to be the fundamental basis of economic exchange. Within this new worldview, we suggest the basic abstraction is the service system, a configuration of people, technologies, and other resources that interact with other service systems to create mutual value. Many systems can be viewed as service systems, including families, cities, and companies, among many others. In this paper, we show how the service-system abstraction can be used to understand how value is co-created, in the process laying the foundation for an integrated science of service.		Paul P.

Encouraging innovative thinking, developing new innovations, and managing the processes by which those innovations are developed are critical aspects of today's firm. Consequently, research which aids in the creation and maintenance of innovative firms is an important topic of inquiry for research communities on innovation management, including the operations management and information systems communities. We review the literature in this important area and offer suggestions for future research on the following topics: innovation within a firm and across the supply chain, technology management, and new product and service development.

98ddba9e0062f0362eb982cae65276834ec775ab	fine-tuning user research to drive innovation	fine-tuning user research	research (MCIR). Here we discuss two dilemmas that confront this type of work. Then we turn to four research challenges these dilemmas give rise to, discuss the limitations of common research practices in dealing with them, and describe our own approach. We also describe some of our findings to give an idea of what our approach yielded. Our project’s goal was to make business intelligence (BI) information more available, relevant, and useful to a large population of so-called casual users. The focus was on usage of quantitative information, typically but not necessarily created by others using specialized BI tools. For those not familiar with the term, BI is any information captured in the course of business operations and made available to support business decision-making. BI can also include externally generated information such as partner-generated data and competitive intelligence. Unlike BI users who are actively engaged with quantitative data as a primary part of their role, casual users were assumed to use BI in a limited way for decision-making, meaning they consume it only occasionally or with little variety or depth of exploration. For example, they would use BI only in reports defined and structured by others, without examining it on their own from different angles. A number of things supported the belief that there was a significant population of such users who were eager to do more with BI. Anecdotes about people’s frustration when trying to access BI, and complaints about problems with integrating data across systems and organizational silos were common. In addition, recent reports by McKinsey [1] and Forrester [2] claimed that demand for and adoption of BI is rapidly spreading beyond the ranks of professional BI analysts. Furthermore, longstanding advocacy of data-based decision-making practices seems to call for richer use of BI. For example, in deciding which products to keep in a product User research that attempts to discover market-changing innovations faces many challenges. The more ambitious the innovation goal, the more difficult it can be to decide whom to study, what to look for, and how to make sense of the findings. Our reflections here are based on our experience collaborating on an ambitious project, in which we conducted in-depth contextual research with 54 people in eight enterprises. Its mission was to generate concepts for innovative solutions that would engage a large, new audience whose needs were not being addressed by existing products. In many respects, this was a dream project for researchers who wanted to introduce usercentered design into the product development process as early as possible. However, in planning the research we had to confront particular dilemmas, stemming from the combined goals of innovation and major market expansion, which we suspected were generalizable to projects with similar goals.

In contrast to the potential, in a recent survey more than half of financial service organizations reported that big data has not delivered the expected value. One of the main reasons for this is related to data quality. The objective of this research is to identify the antecedents of big data quality in financial institutions. This will help to understand how data quality from big data analysis can be improved. For this, a literature review was performed and data was collected using three case studies, followed by content analysis. The overall findings indicate that there are no fundamentally new data quality issues in big data projects. Nevertheless, the complexity of the issues is higher, which makes it harder to assess and attain data quality in big data projects compared to the traditional projects. Ten antecedents of big data quality were identified encompassing data, technology, people, process and procedure, organization, and external aspects.	accessibility;agile software development;big data;centralized computing;data quality;emoticon;information quality;information repository;proceedings of the ieee;research data archiving	Adiska Fardani Haryadi;Joris Hulstijn;Agung Wahyudi;Haiko Van Der Voort;Marijn Janssen	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)	10.1109/BigData.2016.7840595	public relations;data quality;marketing;data mining;business	SE	-75.80039684357745	-0.36252676655181665	193146

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies applying extensive qualitative and quantitative methods to BPR research. The aim of the present paper is to fill this gap by presenting the first complete bibliometric review of BPR research. In this work, for the first time, not only the extant literature published between 1993 and 2012 is analysed but also the most cited bibliographic references using bibliometric techniques. In this way, past and present academic contributions are reviewed. Four main results are forthcoming: first, a certain parallelism is found with bibliometric studies in strategic management. Second, the intellectual grounding for this field involves the subjects of economics, management and finance as its principal contributors. Third, the theoretical basis for the study of BPR mainly involves agency theory, transaction cost theory, and the resource-based view. Fourth, the financial crisis of 2008 explains an important part of current research priorities and trends among BPR scholars.	bibliometrics;parallel computing;strategic management	Angélica María Sánchez-Riofrío;Luis Ángel Guerras-Martín;Francisco Javier Forcadell	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1495-0	social science;knowledge management;data mining;management science;management	HCI	-76.93257061776096	0.3730615473361475	193436

It is an interdisciplinary domain, which draws largely on information systems and organizational science. Not unlike these fields, EE would benefit from a variety of research approaches to study the engineering of socio-technical systems. To analyze the prevalence of different research paradigms and the composition of research topics in the EE field, we examined 115 research papers in the field as presented in four pertinent conferences in 2009-2013: the Practice-Driven Research on Enterprise Transformation (PRET), Enterprise Engineering Working Conference (EEWC) as well as relevant tracks in the Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (MCIS) and in the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS). As per this analysis, the social aspect seems to be under-investigated and the interpretive paradigm under-represented in the EE research, while there seems to be a bias towards technical focus and the functionalist paradigm. The analysis ascertained the need for further evolvement of the EE discipline through more attention to social aspects and a more balanced variety of research approaches. We view that this will balance the course of advancing EE theories with the integration of gathered insights. With this paper, we want to instill a debate on the need for alternative research paradigms and for research on social aspects in the field of EE.	enterprise engineering;european conference on information systems;information system;programming paradigm;relevance;sociotechnical system;theory	Wolfgang A.

c2574f90ae95d39310fdabf7386a20f7c7b038c2	grounded theory methodology in information systems research		Grounded theory methodology (GTM), with its espoused goal of theory development of novel phenomena, has found broad application in Information Systems (IS) research. To investigate how GTM is applied in IS research and how the research contributions are contingent on those applications, we review 43 GTM-based articles in major IS and related journals. Ten of the articles develop theory. The other 33 articles use GTM to develop models and rich descriptions of new phenomena as their theoretical contribution. We show that each of the three forms is valuable to the IS community. For example, studies that develop theories and models are highly cited in the IS literature. We identify nine GTM procedures that are applied in various combinations to develop the three forms of research contribution. Treating GTM as a portfolio of the nine procedures, we examine the implications for the research contribution of adopting the core GTM procedures compared with a partial portfolio of those procedures.	information systems research	Manuel Wiesche;Marlen Jurisch;Philip Yetton;Helmut Krcmar	2017	MIS Quarterly		management science;knowledge management;development theory;information system;grounded theory;computer science;portfolio	ECom	-76.85259392894864	-1.5311368277117192	194812

In many countries the number of pig farms is being reduced, while the herd size of the remaining ones is increasing. Pig production process is partitioned into different phases with specialized farms devoted to piglet production, rearing or fattening pigs are common instead of old farrowing-to-fattening farms. Pig farms have tended to be integrated and coordinate their operations into pork supply chains by using tighter vertical coordination linkages. This paper presents a description of the pork supply chain, stressing the role of pig farming as one of the key issues to improve pork supply chain efficiency. A survey of literature to support the decision making on the pork sector has revealed that most papers had only considered individual farm operations, while the pork supply chain management involves the coordination of sets of farm units at different stages of production. Thus, our contribution emphasizes the importance and complexity of new decision-making tasks regarding the modern organization of the pork sector. All these elements make it possible to envisage new opportunities for operations research methods to be successfully applied to the pork supply chain. Likewise, we have identified some existing gaps in the literature that we believe should be addressed in the near future.	operations research	Sara V. Rodríguez;Lluís M.

ff635ab26005e80bc4a2530f9990d3918a1ab0e3	the creation of a ubiquitous business community for an agribusiness cluster	community;ubiquitous;cluster;agribusiness	Ubiquitous Business Communities (UBC) are information processing systems that offer people the possibility to connect to networks, any time independently from location and computing platforms, which are sensitive to the users ́ contexts. UBC allow participants to exchange information and enhance business transactions. These systems may act as market organizers and may affect millions of producers and clients in developing countries. Our research-in-progress paper presents the creation of a UBC to enhance business transactions in an agribusiness cluster. We highlight some characteristics of the UBC under development, considering the main factors that influence the competitiveness of the cluster. We also describe aspects of the development process of the UBC and of the structuration process of the community (organization of a member and product catalog and of product quality standards). Finally we present expectations to be verified in the implementation process of the UBC.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);information processing	Eduardo Henrique Rigoni;Norberto Hoppen;Amarolinda Klein;Ágata Ritter	2013			computer science;knowledge management;underdevelopment;agribusiness;information processing;developing country;marketing	HCI	-75.78856650257181	4.032289210981123	197576
387ff974c16fdc860c8fc74e87c66406f06736af	an investigation into methods and concepts of qualitative research in information system research	qualitative research	This paper is an initial review of literature, investigating qualitative research, to show its relevance in information system disciplines. Qualitative research involves the use of qualitative data, such as interviews, documents, and participant observation data, to understand and explain social phenomena. Qualitative research can be found in many disciplines and fields, using a variety of approaches, methods and techniques. In Information Systems (IS), there has been a general shift in information system research away from technological to managerial and organizational issues, hence an increasing interest in the application of qualitative research methods. Frequently used methods are the action research, case study, ethnography and grounded theory. Review of each research approaches in qualitative methods, will be discussed. Important considerations in the methods are identified, and cases for each research method are described. Then we will present some benefits and limitations of each method. Based on the result, a framework of an action research was proposed and might be useful in starting a research project in information system using qualitative method.	information system;relevance	Marzanah A.

When accessible to people and businesses, this information can make every area of life, including business, more data-driven. In this ecosystem, with its emphasis on Big Data, there has been a focus on building business models for the provision of services, the so-called Internet of Services IoS. These models assume the existence and development of the necessary IoT measurement and control instruments, communications infrastructure, and easy access to the data collected and information generated by any party. Different business models may support opportunities that generate revenue and value for various types of customers. This paper contributes to the literature by considering business models and opportunities for third-party data analysis services and discusses access to information generated by third parties in relation to Big Data techniques and potential business opportunities.	big data	Izabella Lokshina;Barbara J.

Mikels and Company is a manufacturer that serves mainly as a supplier for the building industry in Israel. The company makes glues and related products used to construct buildings. To begin with, several factors have contributed to the current high price of housing in Israel, including waves of immigration from Russia and Ethiopia during the 1990s, demand created by young couples for housing, and heavy population density in the main cities. These factors particularly accelerated demand for construction of new apartments in this decade, giving rise to an increase in activity for the Israeli construction industry and its suppliers, including M.K. Mikels. The firms principal activities are the design, development, production, and marketing of glue products. This company, which is located in the industrial zone of Rishon-Lezion, is housed in three manufacturing facilities and two other buildings used for administration and management. It has 300 employees, most of whom are employed in manufacturing. Mikels is among the largest companies in Israel serving the market for glue products. It has two key competitors who (along with Mikels) import raw materials from abroad and use a state-run central distribution center (and local agencies) to market their products.	software factory	Charles K.
