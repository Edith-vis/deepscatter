This decision triggered our attempt to set an """"academic world-record"""" for the development and implementation of a unique core course in six months time for all 1,200 incoming Midshipmen. The concern was that many graduates lacked an understanding of the risks and threats pertaining to cyber security, as cyber attacks and cyber crime become greater threats to the health and preservation of the nation. Such instruction simply could not wait; it had to be done, and done immediately. Throughout this paper we present the lessons we learned to provide guidance to others faced with the similar challenge of implementing a university-wide course while under a tight deadline. The insights we gained will prove useful to those thinking of implementing a technical core course, particularly one in cyber security."""	academy;computer security;cybercrime;earliest deadline first scheduling	Christopher Brown;Frederick Crabbe;Rita Doerr;Raymond Greenlaw;Chris Hoffmeister;Justin Monroe;Donald Needham;Andrew Phillips;Stephen Schall;John Schultz;Steven Simon;David Stahl;Sarah Standard	2012		10.1145/2184512.2184535	simulation;engineering;computer security	Crypto	-76.07124750005359	-29.15043050552591	175142

This ability implies the facility to master many facets of the material, and to shape it with plasticity. Computer music environments typically provide points of control to manipulate material by supplying parameters with controllable values. This capability to control the values of parameters is inadequate for many artistic endeavors, and does not reflect the analogous tools and methods of artists working with physical materials. Rather than viewing parameters in computer-based systems as single points of control, the authors posit that parameters must become more multifaceted and dynamic in order to serve the needs of artists. The authors propose an expanded notion of how to work with parameters in computer-centric environments for time-based art. A proposed partial solution to this problem is to give parameters additional properties that define their behavior. An example implementation of these ideas is presented in Jamoma.	max;mechatronics	Timothy A.

f2c9dcbb360af0944cafa2dbd7cff67d2507c3be	communicating culture: an exploratory study of the key concepts in maori culture on maori web sites		We examine how accurately the belief system or cultural concepts of Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, is reconstructed in the virtual world of the Internet. Nine Maori web sites were searched using a list of 44 key concepts in Maori culture. We registered how many pages within a particular web site contain each of the key concepts. These numbers were set up in a data matrix for further statistical analysis. The Multidimensional Scaling method was used to construct a spatial representation of Maori web sites in the space generated by the key concepts in Maori culture. Using the correlation coefficients between derived dimensions and the key concepts we interpreted three dimensions as General Cultural, Intra-tribe Dynamics and Educational. The position of each Maori web site in this space has been located and described.	2.5d;coefficient;exploratory testing;multidimensional scaling;virtual world	Zlatko J.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports on an implementation project, using Talis List, which took place between November 2005 and March 2006. Findings – The project itself was a success, with the target number of reading lists made available being exceeded. As with any new system, the development of the processes involved in its day-to-day running can be unpredictable. Workflows did not develop as anticipated; the ways in which reading lists were collected from academics varied, as did the styles of the lists themselves. Some issues were encountered around linking to electronic resources and embedding the system into the university’s virtual learning environment (VLE). Originality/value – This paper will be of value to those interested in the development and use of online reading lists.	e-book;emoticon;librarian;nl (complexity);open reading frame	Rachael Morgan	2007	Program	10.1108/00330330710774147	education;design methods;computer science;electrical engineering;database;multimedia;higher education;management;law;world wide web;information retrieval;reading;virtual learning environment	HCI	-73.48134005593771	-24.776823398008613	177160

Confronted with a number of ambiguous descriptions of model features we introduce a method for systematically generating a large number of model replications and testing for their equivalence to the original model. While, qualitatively speaking, a number of our replicated models resemble the results of the original model reasonably well, statistical testing reveals that in quantitative terms our endeavor was only partially successful. This fact hints towards some unstated assumptions regarding the original model. Finally we conduct a number of statistical tests with respect to the influence of certain design choices like the method of updating, the timing of events and the randomization of the activation order. The results of these tests highlight the importance of an explicit documentation of design choices and especially of the timing of events. A central lesson learned from this exercise is that the power of statistical replication analysis is to a large degree determined by the available data.	prisoner's dilemma	Wolfgang Radax;Bernhard Rengs	2010	J.

50658af42bb93492f850c24a4faf52565602f8b3	guest editorial for special section on teachers and learning with social network sites		The evolving knowledge society and the emergence of information and communication technologies in our lives present complex challenges for educators and policymakers worldwide. Education requires adjustments to these changes in learning and teaching, in the shattering of boundaries, as well as in providing new meaning to emerging educational paradigms facilitated by uprising interfaces. One of the most salient examples of the need to address unfamiliar educational scenarios is social network sites or social networking sites (SNS). Some argue that such sites are used predominantly to connect with those one already knows and less for traditional Bnetworking^ purposes (Boyd and Ellison 2007). Others prefer the term social networking sites and point to sites such as LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) which are used primarily for Bnetworking^ or building one’s list of personal contacts. We use these terms interchangeably and define SNSs as Web-based communication environments through which individuals can maintain existing social ties and interactions and develop new social ties with individuals outside their network (Ellison et al. 2014). SNS-based communication plays major roles in this change, extending the scope and settings in which teachers and students communicate beyond school boundaries in terms of time, space and definition of roles (Greenhow et al. 2015, 2009; Greenhow and Robelia 2009).

However, the primary burden for knowledge management has been borne by individuals. Technological changes make such informal methods inadequate and necessitate the development of knowledge management systems that alleviate the reliance on individuals. In this paper, we describe the Knowledge Depot knowledge management system. The main technical challenges were to support the entire organization as well as individual work groups, to automate as much information capturing and organizing as possible, to ensure that organization members are aware of the information resources available to them, and to customize the system to fit the unique needs of the sponsoring organization. To address these challenges, the Knowledge Depot system was designed with four main components. The first, Electronic Publication allows selected members of the Next Step Organization to publish content electronically to its members. The second, Communication Networks, provides a way for the users to communicate with relevant groups in the organization and defines the communities of practice for the organization. The third, Group Depots, captures and organizes group communication and other group artifacts. The last, Sharing Mechanisms, allow users to share group repositories and other online content across the organization. We focus primarily on the components of the system and the criteria by which success must be measured.	best practice;focus group;information overload;knowledge management;management system;organizing (structure);secret sharing;telecommunications network;web content	Beatrix Zimmermann;Michael E.

In this paper we report on efforts to develop a new methodology for needs assessment evaluation. We use the Critical Task Method to identify the “bottleneck cognitive tasks” of principals with an unstructured work profile. Data were collected on the computer-support needs of faculty researchers, and the findings indicate that a “knowledge-based” design offers the most promise for delivering effective support. In addition, the systems design suggests the integration of text, data, voice, and images.	systems design	Sidney E. Harris;Harvey J. Brightman	1985	ACM Trans. Inf.

This conceptual article explores alternative active learning techniques supporting independent and collaborative learning within virtual worlds. Within Second Life, educators can utilize a variety of scripted tools and objects as well as techniques of building and terra-forming to create vibrant virtual personal learning environments and learning experiences that are engaging and responsive to individual learners. Issues of embodiment in an avatar are discussed in terms of social presence, and student learning styles are considered as well as approaches to problem-based learning, games, role play, and immersive virtual world environments.

While computer conferencing and virtual worlds both offer audio, video, text and image sharing, in virtual worlds teachers and learners are uniquely embodied as avatars synchronously co-present within immersive 3-dimensional surroundings, engendering a heightened sense of social presence (Warburton, 2009). The virtual world has physics – balls roll, or fall when dropped – and a social and economic milieu in which learners can build artifacts, join in marketplaces of goods or ideas, undertake simulated experiences (Dunleavy, Dede, & Mitchell, 2008), and interact with others beyond the classroom. Unlike conferencing environments, virtual worlds are persistent (Childress & Braswell, 2006), continuing to exist, evolve and change even while learners are offline. To leverage the unique qualities of virtual worlds, instructional designs can integrate these elements of immersion, simulation, and enhanced social presence in interpersonal interaction. TEaChInG In VIrTual WorlDS A long tradition of educational research exists within virtual worlds. In 2003, Delwiche (2006) taught ethnographic research to undergraduate students who formed “the Halfling Ethnographers Guild” within the virtual world of Everquest (http://www.everquest.com/). At Illinois State University, undergraduate education students undertook quests within World of Warcraft (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) (Mullen, Beilke, & Brooks, 2007). Within Quest Atlantis (http://atlantis.crlt.indiana.edu/), fourth graders completed quests to analyze environmental science problems. (Barab et al., 2007) In Active Worlds, Cornell University taught science to high school students, while the University of Colorado-Boulder taught a business accounting course (Damer, 2008; Corbit, 2002). In Second Life, courses ranged from English Composition at Ball State University to law at Harvard Law School, genetics at Texas Wesleyan University, sociology and criminology at Coventry University, computer science at Ohio University, and astrobiology at the University of Arizona (Grove & Steventon, 2008; Gollub, 2007; Ye, Liu, & Polack-Wahl, 2007; Boulous, Heatherington, & Wheeler, 2007). Assessment of education in virtual worlds notes improvements in attentiveness (Mikropoulos, 2001), participation (Ketelhut, 2007), class attendance, and performance on exams (Blaisdell, 2006), although visually rich environments can distract students off-task (Omale et al., 2009). Assessment of satisfaction finds students responding positively to learning activities in Second Life (Jarmon et al., 2009; Good, Howland, & Thackeray, 2008; McVey, 2008) but with some criticisms over workload and ease of use (Wagner, 2008; Wang & Braman, 2009). DeLucia et al. (2009) found college students experienced a high level of social presence in Second Life. Establishing relevance of virtual world activity to course learning is important for student satisfaction (Minocha & Tingle, 2008; Mayrath et al., 2007). There should be solid pedagogical reasons for visiting Second Life such as observing events, visiting relevant places, or participating in learning activities. Cost in both cognitive load and technical requirements should be considered to ensure sufficient time, training, and technical trouble-shooting for students to participate successfully in activities and assignments (Conrad, 2002; Guzdial, 2001). Since significant effort is required to use Second Life, basic skills orientation is a necessary first step. orIEnTaTIon To SEConD lIFE Students begin by registering a free account at the Linden Lab’s Second Life Web site (http:// www.secondlife.com). There are several bits of useful advice for students at this point, as well as planning decisions for instructors to consider. First, instructors should consider making activities optional.

An infusion of digital curation competencies into the LIS curriculum will ensure that students pursuing related professions—including archivists, museum technicians, librarians, and conservators—are also prepared to serve as stewards of our digital treasure. The unintended consequence of this approach may well be the sustainability of Digital Curation courses and, therefore, Digital Curation curricula.

e88fef4b5e2261057c60d2e3818915e53b2ef4c3	transformative learning: moving beyond theory and practice		Events or experiences that have a transformative effect on people’s lives can have an even greater impact if they are documented and disseminated through books, articles, or other forms of media. Whether one learns of such episodes through personal interaction or published sources, these personal stories enrich and inform one’s own life, providing unique insights that help one to understand oneself and others. Scholars have studied transformative learning for 40 years, but Michael Kroth and Patricia Cranton, in their 2014 book Stories of Transformative Learning, expanded the world’s understanding by focusing on firsthand accounts of this phenomenon. Using Kroth and Cranton’s work as a backdrop, this article presents stories of adult learners who set out to earn graduate degrees but also discovered a renewed sense of themselves along the way. The stories shared here illustrate how learners’ beliefs were constructed, challenged, and then transformed, enabling them to overcome prejudices, increase their self-confidence, and experience a new sense of personhood. The participants’ transformative learning experiences were authenticated through interviews, writings, and artistic expressions. Notably, these stories were collected many years after the individuals featured had completed their programs, validating the claim that transformative learning has a long-term effect and that truly transformed people do not eventually revert to their prior ways of thinking and being. A brief literature review is also included.

The intellectual freedom issues are discussed along with the range of responses to them, including the use of filtering software and the teaching of information literacy skills. Both the digital challenge to conventional collection development policy and the problem of equity are linked to the issue of access to information. The outcomes for children from digital libraries are weighed, and a policy metanarrative is constructed from the conflicting images of the child in the digital world by including the computer as an active protagonist interacting constructively with the child.	content-control software;digital library;freedom of information laws by country;information literacy;intellectual freedom;interaction;library (computing)	Virginia A.

Todayu0027s health care professionals must be information literate, having the necessary skills to effectively locate, retrieve, evaluate, and use information. Librarians and other faculty must partner to ensure students learn these skills while building a desire for lifelong learning. Pathways to Nursing: A Guide to Library and Online Research in Nursing and Allied Health attempts to “provide instruction for doing research in the area [sic] of nursing and allied health sciences” (p. vii) for nursing students and working professionals. The authors provide direction for the research process focusing on the library as a physical space, the catalog, reference works, periodicals and indexes, electronic resources, and the Internet and finally providing guidance on writing research papers.rnrnThe “Electronic Resources and the Internet” chapter lays out essential issues for any researcher attempting to use the open Web. It provides sound guidelines for evaluating the quality of information, explains the different types of search engines, and provides strategies for identifying useful Websites. It contains useful information for any person attempting to use the Internet to do serious research yet makes unfortunately few connections to nursing and allied health research.rnrnAlthough a careful reader can glean useful insights, on balance, the book is not relevant to researchers in nursing and virtually ignores research issues in the allied health sciences. Much of the text seems out of touch with the current state of libraries and information technology. For example, its ninety pages include four pages devoted to the card catalog. Although the authors attempt to demystify the Library of Congress system and the Dewey Decimal System, they make only a passing reference to the National Library of Medicine classification system.rnrnBecause nursing and allied health research relies heavily on the journal literature, the “Periodicals and Indexes” chapter is among the most important. It includes descriptions of relevant resources such as CINAHL, MEDLINE/ PubMed, and the Annual Review of Nursing Research. The brief description of CINAHL fails to mention many of the indexed allied health disciplines and other useful features in the database such as the full-text state nursing journals, citation indexing, and quality filters. A number of the recommended indexes are of limited value to the intended audience, including Biography Index, Current Book Review Citations (covering 1976–1982), Essay and General Literature Index, Humanities Index, and the Readeru0027s Guide to Periodical Literature.rnrnThe guidelines for writing research papers explain topic formulation, information retrieval, and the writing process. The authors present a tried-and-true method for creating, cataloging, and organizing index cards, which might seem dated to many of todayu0027s computer savvy students.rnrnThe appendix provides an extensive list of print and electronic resources related to nursing and other non–health sciences topics. Many of the nursing resources are worthwhile, including suggested indexes, periodicals, style guides, Websites, dictionaries, and other reference works; however, the list includes no allied health resources. The eclectic mix of recommended Websites ranges from the highly relevant National League for Nursing and Hardin Meta Directory to others of lesser importance for health sciences researchers such as the Internet Movie Database and the Semantic Rhyming Dictionary. The extensive list of document delivery providers would be useful to librarians attempting to identify highly specialized research support services. Overall, a number of the uniform resource locators (URLs) for listed Websites are no longer current, and two of the books are out of date.rnrnRather than purchase this book, most libraries would be better served buying a more general nursing research guide, such as Notteru0027s Essentials of Nursing Research [1], and supplement it by partnering with faculty to create instruction sessions, pathfinders, and other tools to support student research efforts.

Chat rooms are used to discuss virtually any subject, including computer hacking and bomb making, creating a virtual sanctuary for criminals to collaborate. Given the upsurge of interest in homeland security issues, we have developed a text classification system that creates a concept-based profile that represents a summary of the topics discussed in a chat room or by an individual participant. We then discuss this basic chat profiling system and demonstrate the ability to selectively augment the standard concept database with new concepts of significance to an agent. Finally, we show how an investigator can, once alerted to a user or session of interest via the profile, retrieve details about the chat session through our chat archiving and search system.	archive;chat room;document classification;hacker;internet	Jason Bengel;Susan Gauch;Eera Mittur;Rajan Vijayaraghavan	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25952-7_20	homeland security;juvenile delinquency;the internet;content analysis;biological classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;justice;terrorism;law;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-74.03369423945244	-24.397151971103675	190528

The alterations are grouped into the following five areas: content and body of knowledge; pedagogy; audience; training-on-the-job; and professional skills. The paper argues that extending the scope of knowledge beyond the narrow borders of primary computer science topics (“breadth in computer science”) will lay a solid foundation for building the necessary skills for the future work force.	bobby (software);computer science;d-grid;liz mcintyre (writer);michael j. fischer;patrick c. fischer;ueli maurer (cryptographer);women in computing	Gitta Domik	2001	J.

This reality has been demonstrated in the literature and solutions have been proposed. This paper explains the causes behind the problem, examines each of the proposed solutions, discusses the few implementations made with those solutions, and estimates whether the potential benefits merit the efforts required to implement the available solutions. Each of the solutions is analyzed from standardization and pragmatic perspectives. In particular, we critically analyze the solution proposed by NISO (RP-22-2015), and compare it with the solution offered by the JEMO project, which is based on using metadata elements from namespaces and XML schemas already being used by publishers. The contribution presents a number of case studies which show that research published as OA ends up erroneously being labelled as non-OA on the electronic services used by the end-user, when one of the components of the supply and delivery chain for e-journals fails to include OA information in its metadata. Furthermore, the case studies demonstrate that publishers of hybrid journals should not be the only ones being answerable for the problem. In fact, during the study, some publishers were actually not allowed to enable OA identification, at the article level, by key components of the supply chain. In those case studies, we worked with a sample of publishers that implemented the JEMO solution. From those experiences we draw answers to the main question of this presentation: which solution should be used to enable OA discovery from hybrid journals? What becomes apparent is that publishers are prepared and willing to implement any of the available solutions in their publishing workflow. The paper proposes that the simplest option is the best solution to provide standardized means to identify OA at the article level.

Supplementing data from the American Council on Education (ACE) on internationalization of higher education, this research measured the level of international activities taking place in academic libraries and their role in campus internationalization efforts. The results of this study indicated that responding libraries contribute broadly to campus internationalizing efforts yet trail campuses in strategic planning and organizational support. Based on analysis of the results in comparison with ACE data, the authors provide suggestions for further library initiatives and research that focuses on international and global learning activities.

A comprehensive review incorporating over 2000 links led to identification of over 200 Web 2.0 technologies that were suitable for learning and teaching purposes. The typological analysis involved development of relevant Web 2.0 dimensions, grouping cases according to observed regularities and construction of types based on meaningful relationships. Characterisation of the constructed types incorporated descriptions based on attributes, examples of representative instances and typical pedagogical use cases. The analysis resulted in a typology of 37 types of Web 2.0 technologies that were arranged into 14 clusters. Results of this study imply that educators typically have a narrow conception of Web 2.0 technologies and there is a wide array of Web 2.0 tools and approaches yet to be fully harnessed by learning designers and educational researchers.

In order for this to happen students need to develop the capability to deal with information. This qualitative interview–based study examines lecturer perspectives on the roles of electronic information resources in undergraduate education. In line with the phenomenographic tradition, three functional categories of electronic information use are proposed. Firstly, the “electronic academic library” offers new opportunities for access to materials but lecturers indicated minimal change to their teaching approaches. Electronic resources were simply added to reading lists and the responsibility for developing students’ information skills was seen to rest with librarians. Secondly, lecturers identified changes towards more constructivist approaches to learning, drawing upon new sources of primary data available electronically and described specific teaching approaches to assist students to develop the relevant information handling skills. Finally, lecturers were uncertain about the value of the wider information resources of the Internet/Web for students and were concerned about variable information quality and the possibilities of plagiarism. The research indicates that information use in student learning is a multi–faceted phenomenon. Much current discussion centres on the concept of information literacy which draws together information skills and subject-related skills and knowledge. Students do not merely require generic information skills but a knowledge of the discipline and the capability to handle complex information. Partnerships between academics and librarians are a way forward in helping students to develop as autonomous information users. Not only do the two professional groups offer different expertise, but they also bring different perspectives on the problematic balance between student autonomy and student support.

So, we came up with an exercise in the form of a board game which gives new consultants some idea of what might happen on the job and what might happen in their personal lives and how this all works together with their time management and self-esteem.The Consultant Game is a fun game of chance and choice, much like life, and consultants learn how their work and personal lives are integrated, as well as finding out that they are expected to grow in the position by learning new skills and teaching others. The Consultant Game takes consultants through a month of consulting in which they have just so many Time and Self-Esteem Units. As they go through the days, there are chance events that occur and choices to be made which can improve or worsen their Self-Esteem and/or take or save some Time. They can also choose to expend Time units to learn new skills and can even teach others that skill once they mastered it for Self-Esteem Units. They also go through Paydays, of course, which gives them Self-Esteem as well as money.The game is followed up with a 15-20 minute 'debriefing' session to make sure all consultants understand the learning points from the game.	incidence matrix	Linda Kingsbury;Scott Harrigan;Tina Reed	2002		10.1145/588646.588687	psychology;simulation;knowledge management;pedagogy	ML	-70.13877168447208	-30.184664999229884	198305
a7fe627ed89718318d74f7b73fecc1d6d2583560	comparative analysis of the content of school course of informatics in russia and subjects of the international competition bebras		During of the first twenty-five years of its existence, the informatics course in Russian school was structured around following cross-cutting content lines: information and information processes; representation of information; computer; modeling and formalization; algorithmization and programming; Information Technology; computer telecommunications, social informatics. Recently thematic block Mathematical foundations of computer science has been more clearly formed in it. In addition traditional line of algorithmization and programming, which was transformed into the thematic block Algorithms and programming elements, which includes robotics and mathematical modeling, has developed significantly. In general content of the course of informatics is stable, its fundamental component is the basis of the state final certification of graduates of primary and senior schools. At the same time students, their parents as well as representatives of the higher education and IT industry express concern about content of the modern school informatics course, rightly believing that this discipline has much greater potential for mastering such key competences of the digital economy as basic programming, basics of working with data, communication in modern digital environments. Since 2012, Russian students successfully participate in the international distant competition Bebras, in the tasks of which priority is given to the issues of theoretical informatics as the basis of modern information technologies. The subject field of the competition is in many respects consonant with the content lines of Russian informatics course in school, the main differences lie in approaches to the representation of key concepts, ideas, methods and algorithms. Materials of the international competition Bebras can become a basis for the modernization of Russian informatics course in school by expanding its theoretical base as well as ensuring the unity of its theoretical and practical components.	informatics	Philippe Le Billon	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-02750-6_12	knowledge management;certification;modernization theory;higher education;social informatics;informatics;information technology;competence (human resources);digital economy;computer science	Arch	-74.9759625616776	-30.044765141671487	198350

f2cb40f69cf8a8d35c60df8ae74d187c75935855	a web-based collaboration system for geographically distributed medical professionals		This paper is about a web-based system for collaboration and sharing of information among medical professionals. The system, originally targeted for ophthalmologists, has a generic design that easily can be adapted to other medical disciplines. The collaboration system includes services for communication, second opinion and a case archive. Only a standard Internet browser is needed in order to use the system. Today, there are many registered users of the system in the ophthalmology community, but the usage of the system is less than could be expected from the enthusiasm exp ressed in a feasibility study we made, and still present in the community. We give special attention to this problem, and discuss various barriers and facilitators for usage. The usage is, among others, influenced by factors such as the medical professional’s familiarity with ICT in general and digital imaging in particular, and the available infrastructure at their work.

This observatory, nowadays, collects data from more than 50 Spanish universities and more than 134,000 graduate students in order to measure diverse factors linked to their professional career development and their employability. The paper explains many problems that this kind of project related to Academic Analytics and Institutional Intelligence needs to face and solve, as well as it explain some of the most important concerns and considerations that should be taken in the context of deploying a project like the described in a national scope. Also the paper shows an introduction of how was planned the data strategy to gather the information, how was built the collector system, and how it will exploit the information from the perspective of Academic Analytics in order to provide great insights about the factors in graduate's employability in order to use it to make decisions and feedback the Institutional Intelligence processes.	information system	Francisco Michavila;Martín Martín-González;Jorge M.

eb25b8fc54ca52134931d44f0e3764d50534986a	vision for advanced robot project	advanced robot project	1 About us Walking with Robots Walking with Robots is a three-year programme of events and activities designed to delight audiences with the potentials of robotics research whilst encouraging them to consider the technical challenges and ethical implications of that research. The Walking with Robots network brings robotics researchers together with leading science communicators to promote a wider public engagement with the reality of contemporary robotics research. The Royal Academy of Engineering As Britain's national academy for engineering, we bring together the country's most eminent engineers from all disciplines to promote excellence in the science, art and practice of engineering. Our strategic priorities are to enhance the UK's engineering capabilities; to celebrate excellence and inspire the next generation; and to lead debate by guiding informed thinking and influencing public policy. The Academy's public engagement programme aims to raise awareness and create platforms for wider debate and dialogue on the applications and implications of engineering and technology in society. Its aim is to create more people with engineering skills in the capital, forming a pipeline that takes students from school, through FE and HE and into the profession. It particularly seeks to engage women and Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani students, all of whom are currently under-represented in engineering. The UK's first young people's robotics Vision Conference was a pilot project run as a partnership between Walking with Robots, The Royal Academy of Engineering and the London Engineering Project. The conference provided the participants, who were aged 16 and over, with the opportunity to explore advanced robotics research, have their views heard on how these new technologies could be used in the future and explore their potential impact on society. Vision Conferences enable groups of people to create visions for the future about a specific theme 1. The purpose of these conferences is not just about generating ideas but about helping to develop and inform strategies for the future. Twenty young people from selected London schools attended the two-day conference, which took place at The Royal Academy of Engineering in December 2007. The conference participants took part in a range of facilitated activities over the two days, including plenary sessions, interactive group work, discussions and debates. • Robotics has many benefits to offer future society but policy makers, scientists and engineers need to think carefully about the motivations behind robotic developments and their potential consequences. • Particular advantages of robotics were considered …	academy;next-generation network;pipeline (computing);robot;while	Yoshiaki Shirai	1986			robot;simulation;robot learning;mobile robot;computer science	Robotics	-75.52568941643321	-28.59918035036615	199464

It offers a glimpse into both personal and professional aspects of medical students' lives and identifies various ways medical students may be using blogs as one of the coping mechanisms to survive the difficult years of medical school and residency training. Findings suggest that at least some medical students are benefiting from the blogging technology due to the ability to communicate with other members of medical students' virtual community of practice. These individuals are blogging mostly anonymously, thus expressing ideas and sharing experiences without a fear of mixing professional and personal lives. Blogging allows them to share ideas, ask questions, offer and obtain solutions, share cases and experiences, or simply socialise with other medical students, thus providing informal support to each other. In addition, it appears that many medical students use blogs to document their years of medical school and residency training as a way to reflect on their daily lives and offer valuable insights and advice to future students.	blog	Salam N.
