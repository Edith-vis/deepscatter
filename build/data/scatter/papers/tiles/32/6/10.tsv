Prior to 2011, the school was not very technologically advanced, mainly due to financial constraints which impacted on infrastructure, procurement of hardware and software, the availability of computers to students and learning and teaching. This study considers the perceptions of student and teachers about the integration of the 1:1 program across the School. A mixed methodology was employed comprising qualitative interview data and questionnaires to provide quantitative responses. This enabled an exploration of the effect of the 1:1 program as reported by teachers and the students themselves, as well as the examination of a range of related issues, such as the use of the devices, as well as issues about the implementation of the program. The findings are presented in a thematic style and provide insight into how the 1:1 program was deployed each year through the lens of students and teachers. The paper concludes with recommendations for the successful implementation of a 1:1 program.	1:1 pixel mapping;computer;procurement	Therese Keane;William F.

The use of technology is gaining rising importance in higher education due to the benefits that it brings. In terms of adopting new technologies to teaching, new forms of teaching, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), are increasingly seen as a feasible future form of learning. The importance of MOOCs in higher education has caused debates in the computing education research. This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the pedagogical implications of MOOCs to higher education. Research in MOOCs is of vital importance because these courses may offer meaningful learning opportunities for those otherwise impossible through means of distance learning. The concepts of e-learning, online learning and distance learning have been previously addressed where previous research has indicated that the integration of online technologies to higher education do not automatically support learning. Many education institutions still question the sustainability of courses using extensive online technologies in higher education. The authors open up new research opportunities in a student-centered design in MOOCs incorporating a personalized learning environment to online education.

University courses in general assume that the first year students possess adequate computational background and abilities. But unfortunately this is not always the case: freshmen experience troubles in analysing and solving problems with computation tools, in particular by means of programming activities. Therefore, it is an imperative task to find strategies that can mitigate initial difficulties and balance background deficiencies. In this work, we consider the effect of the eXtreme Apprenticeship teaching methodology and analyse the role of sex and background.

In addition they were invited to offer curricular justifications for each of the four pieces of software. Overall there was a wide spread of competence with, and classroom use of, all four pieces of software. Databases were perceived to have limited curricular value with justifications focusing on narrow aspects of data handling. Logo was viewed positively with justifications addressing issues such as motivation and covering a range of geometrical topics. Spreadsheets were seen as the most versatile software with justifications being spread across a range of curriculum areas. With few exceptions Basic was dismissed as being of little use. Competent teachers who used software regularly tended to have shorter lengths of service, better qualifications and were more likely to be male than female. The converse was also found to be true. Introduction The mathematics National Curriculum for England and Wales, despite two revisions, continues to expect teachers to use computers in their teaching. For the most part, reference to the use of computers has been sufficiently general for teachers to exploit whatever software has been available. However, spreadsheets, databases, Logo and Basic have received more than implicit mention and it is on teachers’ use of these that this paper focuses. The original Department of Education and Science (DES, 1989) document placed spreadsheets and databases within both Statements of Attainment and Programmes of Study. That is, there was a statutory requirement for teachers to use spreadsheets in their work on algebra—although it should be noted that spreadsheets were conjoined with other computer facilities—and databases within their work on data handling. References to the use of Basic and Logo were confined to the examples and had no statutory weight. Logo appeared more frequently than any other form of software in both algebraic and geometric contexts whilst Basic appeared just once in the form of a simple program as an example for work on algebra. After the first revision (DES, 1991a), the requirement to use computers was little changed. Databases and Basic were maintained exactly as before. Spreadsheets were kept within the Programmes of Study but removed from the Statements of Attainment to emphasise the more general part of the original conjunction. Logo retained its exemplary position for algebra but was replaced, in respect of geometry, by the more generic turtle geometry. By 1995 the Programmes of Study (DFE, 1995a) had become the focus in order to facilitate teachers’ planning and offer the appearance of a less prescriptive curriculum. The use of computers was emphasised throughout although reference to specific software was rare. Databases were there for some data handling work but less than before. Logo and Basic were no longer to be found—even turtle geometry had disappeared. Spreadsheets were relegated once more and were now mentioned only as an example of a problem-solving tool for work on number. In other words, Logo and Basic were out whilst spreadsheets and databases stayed—but only just. Such reductions in specificity could facilitate teachers’ exploitation of the software available to them. However, curriculum documents are ambivalent in their advocacy of computer use and that “for teachers who do not want to see it, the use of technology is not apparent” (McDonald, 1993, 142). Few teachers were found to use computers. Moreover, they “did little that could be described as exploiting the overwhelming possibilities of information technology” (Veen, 1993, 149). There have been studies on computer use by teachers in England and Wales but little in respect of teachers’ use of the software discussed above, their competence with it and their perceptions of the educational benefits that might accrue. The following describes a survey study of mathematics teachers’ practices and perceptions in respect of spreadsheets, databases, Logo and Basic. Method A questionnaire was constructed to determine, inter alia, mathematics teachers’ perceptions of the availability of appropriate hardware, attitudes towards computers, perceptions of the benefits IT brings to children’s learning of mathematics and, the aspect reported here, their expertise with, classroom use of, and rationale for, the four pieces of software—databases, spreadsheets, Basic and Logo. In addition teachers were asked to indicate their length of service, gender and main qualification. Two disjoint sets of schools received the questionnaires. The first comprised forty schools and the second seventy. The first set received their questionnaires in the Autumn of 1992 and the second in the Autumn of 1994. The procedures for the selection of Information technology in the mathematics curriculum 245 © National Council for Educational Technology, 1997. both samples were the same and are described elsewhere (Andrews, 1995). The section of the questionnaire reported here comprised twelve items (Table 1). The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows. Results In 1992 79 teachers returned questionnaires suitable for analysis. The 1994 sample yielded 106. Tests showed no significant differences between the two samples so they were merged. Some surprise was felt, particularly as the surveys were conducted at a time of substantial growth in the number of computers in schools (DES, 1991b; DFE, 1993; DFE, 1995b), at teachers’ perceptions appearing unaffected by the passage of two years. For ease of description, and where appropriate, data derived from the seven point scales have been collapsed into three categories. Scores of one and two have been recorded as low (re-coded as 1). Scores of three, four and five are considered average (re-coded as 2) whilst sixes and sevens are counted as high (re-coded as 3). The analysis, however, 246 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 28 No 4 1997 © National Council for Educational Technology, 1997. Table 1: Twelve items pertaining to teachers’ competence with, classroom use of, and justification for, the four forms of software Items 1 to 4 were presented alongside seven point scales ranging from low level to high level: 1. How would you describe your ability to handle a database? 2. How would you describe your ability to handle a spreadsheet? 3. How would you describe your ability to program with Basic? 4. How would you describe your ability to program with Logo? Items 5 to 8 were presented alongside seven point scales ranging from never to regularly: 5. Do you ever use a database in your teaching of mathematics? 6. Do you ever use a spreadsheet in your teaching of mathematics? 7. Do you ever write Basic programs for mathematics lessons? 8. Do your pupils ever use Logo in mathematics lessons? Items 9 to 12 were presented as open questions with spaces for written responses: 9. Why do you think databases are useful in mathematics teaching? 10. Why do you think spreadsheets are useful in mathematics teaching? 11. Why do you think Basic is useful in the teaching of mathematics? 12. Why do you think Logo is useful in the teaching of mathematics? The criteria for coding were as follows: Description Criterion Code Sophisticated negative Criticism citing more than one topic area 1 Specified negative Criticism citing one topic area 2 Unspecified negative Unspecified criticism 3 Uncertain Neutral, uncertain or nil return 4 Unspecified positive Unspecified support 5 Specified positive Support citing one topic area 6 Sophisticated positive Support citing more than one topic area 7 was performed on the full range of responses to maximise available variation. Where a probability has been cited its derivation rests with a t-test. Teachers’ competence with National Curriculum software The discussion that follows considers teachers’ statements about their abilities to use various forms of software. In this context the natural description for people who perceive themselves as having low levels of skill and confidence with computer software is incompetent. No pejorative association is intended by the use of the word. The results (Table 2) indicated a spread of competence across all software. Analyses of variance found neither three-way nor two-way interactions in respect of length of service, gender and qualification although there were several significant one-way influences. The shorter a teacher’s length of service the more likely that teacher was to claim competence with all software except Basic. Graduates in mathematics or mathematics education were more likely to be competent with databases, spreadsheets and Logo than incompetent. They were also more likely to be competent with the same software than non-graduates who were more likely to be incompetent than competent. Graduates in other disciplines were split evenly across all levels of competence. Gender influenced teachers’ competence across all software with males rating themselves more competent than females. Teachers’ classroom use of National Curriculum software The results (Table 3) indicate that few teachers perceive themselves as frequent users of any of the named software. Analyses of variance identified only one-way interactions Information technology in the mathematics curriculum 247 © National Council for Educational Technology, 1997.

We explain how the system, as part of wider research on ambient learning spaces, has been developed on the basis of systemic-constructivist pedagogy, which emphasizes the design of learning environments for contemporary teaching. For the design of such learning environments key elements of educational theories play an important role. With the recent redesign of MoLES - now part of ambient learning spaces where different applications use the same multimedia objects - we introduce semantic multimedia cloud computing and linked data models as a key educational element in the context of situated and mobile learning.	cloud computing;data model;linked data;situated;theory	Thomas Winkler;Michael Herczeg	2013		10.1145/2485760.2485829	robot learning;educational technology;simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication;synchronous learning	HCI	-70.28290465923595	-37.927146390064976	179268

The paper focuses on claims about the Net generation’s relationship to collaboration and cooperation and the ways that this relationship is associated with technological rather than social processes. Based on a survey of first year students in five universities across a range of subjects and disciplinary areas, the paper concludes that we should be cautious about the claims that have been made about Net generation learners. It suggests that broad brush approaches to generational changes obscure the subtle but important differences between students. It also suggests that claims that there has been a step change in attitudes takes attention away from the kinds of choices that might be necessary in relation to variations that are indeed taking place amongst new cohorts of students. The Net Generation The term Net generation originates in the work of Tapscott (1998 and 2008). His arguments are about an entire generation. Today's youth are different from any generation before them. They are exposed to digital technology in virtually all facets of their day-to-day existence, and it is not difficult to see that this is having a profound impact on their personalities, including their attitudes and approach to learning. Tapscott (1998 a) Tapscott uses his arguments about the Net generation to argue that technological changes lead to ‘inevitable’ consequences for teaching and learning. “But as we make this inevitable transition we may best turn to the generation raised on and immersed in new technologies.” (Tapscott 1999 p11). The change favored by Tapscott is a move from teacher-centered to learner-centered approaches and he claims that the ultimate interactive learning environment is the internet itself. A second common source for arguments about the Net generation comes from articles written by Prensky and the idea of Digital Natives (Prensky 2001 and 2001a). Prensky argues that digital natives are part of a generation that have: .. not just changed incrementally from those of the past, nor simply changed their slang, clothes, body adornments, or styles, as has happened between generations previously. A really big discontinuity has taken place. One might even call it a “singularity” – an event which changes things so fundamentally that there is absolutely no going back. (Prensky 2001 p 1) Presnky’s comments were made directly in relation to students but they were about the entire generation in schools and colleges and not limited to those pursuing higher education. The discontinuity described by Prensky focused on thinking and processing differently. Prensky even makes the claim that the brains of the new generation are different (Prensky 2001a). Prensky’s claim was that the biggest problem in education was a disconnect between ‘digital native’ students and ‘digital immigrant’ staff who retained the ‘accent’ of a different era even when they were fully socialized into a digital environment. Prensky argues that if you are not part of the new generation you will always be marked by your earlier experience. In this sense being a digital native or a digital immigrant is not a learned skill it is a fixed product of early development. Despite having slightly different emphases both Prensky and Tapscott rely heavily on technological determinist arguments. Tapscott’s argument that changes to pedagogy are ‘inevitable’ is a classic example of this flawed approach. A further source of arguments about this new generation of students comes from Diana Oblinger of EduCause who has called the generation born after 1982 the Millenials and claims that this group: • gravitate towards group activity • identify with their parent’s values and feel close to their parents • spend more time doing homework and housework and less time watching TV • believe “it is cool to be smart” • are fascinated by new technologies • are racially and ethnically diverse and • often (at least on in five) have one immigrant parent. This description of the Millenials unlike the work of Prensky and Tapscott is empirically based and is supported by large scale annual surveys of students in the USA (see for example Salaway et al. 2008). Oblinger’s argument is strongly related to Prensky’s ideas and Oblinger claims to have found a trend towards an internet age mindset. She also agrees with Prensky that there is a disconnect between the new Millenial students and the institutions that they are enrolled in. However Oblinger and Oblinger (2005) do not agree that the determinant is simply age: “Although these trends are described in generational terms, age may be less important than exposure to technology.” (2.9). This difference in understanding allows for older students to have different approaches based on their exposure to new technologies. Although the arguments of these three authors are actually somewhat different they are used widely and largely interchangeably. There has been relatively little discussion of these themes in recent CSCL conferences (Shih and Swan 2005) or in the international journal of CSCL, but in the wider literature there has been a more developed discussion of the issues that the Net generation raises, and this discussion has included discussion in relation to CSCL (e.g. Nilsen and Instefjord 2000).. Net generation and collaboration The Net generation argument has consistently associated the rising generation with new forms of sociality and a desire to work in teams or group. Most recently Tapscott’s new book includes this comment: “In education they [the Net generation] are forcing a change in the model of pedagogy, from a teacher-focused approach based on instruction to a student-focused model based on collaboration.” (2008 p 11). There are from our point of view two interesting aspects of this argument. Firstly the Net generation are ‘forcing’ this change, a twist on the technological determinism noted earlier, to which Tapscott has now added a generational determinism as if the Net generation controlled the educational institutions in which they are largely subjects. Secondly the association of the new pedagogy and a student-focus with collaboration, as if this was the sole and specific way that student-focused education could be obtained. Oblinger and Oblinger express an equally generalized notion of collaboration arguing in relation to teams that: The Net Gen often prefers to learn and work in teams. A peer-to-peer approach is common, as well, where students help each other. In fact, Net Geners find peers more credible than teachers when it comes to determining what is worth paying attention to. (2005 2.7) The argument that there is a Net generation has an educational component which suggests that the new generation of learners will be pre-conditioned by their use of technology to drive changes in pedagogy in educational institutions and that these changes will include aspects of collaboration, particularly team work and peer-to-peer learning. The research This research which is the first pilot phase of a two year study took place in the spring of 2008 in five universities in the UK. The universities were selected to represent the main ‘types’ of university found in the UK system and 14 courses were surveyed across a range of applied and pure disciplinary and subject areas (see Table 1). A questionnaire of first-year experiences of e-learning developed by the research team was administered in all five participating institutions. The instrument sought to collect baseline information about some of the key aspects of the students’ use of technology in their studies and consisted of four sections: demographic characteristics of the respondents, access to technology, use of technology in university studies in general and finally course-specific uses of technology.

In this study, results of a survey in Irish Primary Schools, and interviews with tutors, indicate that characteristics of learners with autism need to be more integrated into the design process. An interaction model, based on Norman's and Abowd and Beale's models, provides a basis for mapping special user requirements and instructional strategies onto a model suited to the learner with autism. We propose this extended interaction model as a basis for design guidelines for effective educational software for these special needs learners.	interaction design;requirement;user requirements document	Mary Barry;Ian J.

This is happening despite the emphasis on equal access for all to higher education. If the electronic content that is uploaded onto Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) is intended to be used by students about whom no presumptions of visual ability can be made, then accessibility must be guaranteed for all users. In this paper, we attempt to identify the various reasons why so much electronic content is un-accessible to visually impaired students. This paper is based on the quantitative analysis of a survey conducted on 130 university lecturers in February 2008. This paper examines the current laws and standards that exist for accessibility of online electronic documents, and the extent to which these laws and standards are implemented in the electronic content that is added to VLEs. We set out the basic standards to which all electronic material should conform to ensure that it is accessible to users with visual impairments. We show that the majority of accessibility problems that exist for visually impaired students result from people incorrectly using technology. © 2008 IADIS.

Under these conditions, foreign language proficiency is no longer a luxury and it is becoming an important tool to implement goals of university development. In this regard, new methods and techniques of foreign language teaching are highly demanded, which would significantly improve the language competency of both students and faculty members. A search for effective methods to enhance foreign language teaching makes analyze Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) open educational platforms and consider an opportunity for these platforms to be integrated into the existing system of foreign language teaching in Russian higher education institutions. Based on the research findings, the author concludes that it is irrational to use the resources as embedded components without significant adjustment to the conditions existing in the current higher education system.

Over the past three decades, technology mediated learning has been recognized as an alternate channel strengthening the traditional forms of education. However, the organizational learning at the peripheries and capacity development at the grass roots remain almost unattended, despite recognized global efforts under many bottom-up empowerment sequences. Social components at large within the transitional and developing economies remain outside the enclosure of universal access to information and thus access to knowledge has always been constricted to equitably compete with the global knowledge economy. Despite challenges in designing and implementing collaborative learning techniques and technologies, this article would like to emphasize on introducing collaborative learning at community level and improve the knowledge capacity at the grass roots for their empowerment. The article, further, investigates the relationship of collaborative learning towards improved e-governance.

Despite this huge investment, there is a little success achieved so far. It is obvious that technology integration is a complex and demanding issues and this puts more burdens on schools. On the other hand, technology planning, as a process and product, holds a number of promises to overcome those problems. Thus, the purpose of this present study was to illustrate how technology planning process was carried out in a private K-12 school in Turkey. Data were collected from 105 teachers, 25 administrative staff, and 376 students. Teachers and administrative staff were asked to fill out a questionnaire to gather data on their perceived computer literacy, issues related to ICT usage. Students were also asked about their perceptions on the current utilization of ICT at their school.

Indeed, the rapid emergence of the new e-learning platforms have been presented in many interests. However, the quality of the teaching service rendered depends on the capacity of the learning approaches to be provided to learners, content and learning path tailored to their needs. In this paper, we will present how Big Data helps to solve education issues through reaching the objective of learning. Then, we will introduce some opportunities of Big Data analytics to develop the efficiency and effectiveness of students learning and maximize their knowledge retention. Finally, our research method show that students can generate personalized activities and offer academic advising. Big Data can expose the capabilities of learners, predict their future performances and offer assistance for educational organizations to make strategic decisions.	big data	Marouane Birjali;Abderrahim Beni Hssane;Mohammed Erritali	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-60834-1_22	educational technology;technology education;big data;academic advising;learning analytics;knowledge management;computer science	HCI	-75.6186066694827	-37.78336063912553	181435

0f0cda45fb950ab9f58ef7efcbca5ef145f6abf4	towards evaluating the performance of higher education: from a non-financial perspective		In recent years, most of the research efforts on performance evaluation of higher education in China are barely based on the financial data, but lack of considering the non-financial data. However, evaluating the performance from non-financial perspective will be an interesting yet challenging task, due in large part to the complexity and qualitative property of the non-financial data. In this paper, we employ the multiple linear regression model for incorporating the non-financial data into the performance evaluation. Our results show that institutes of high education can increase the utilization efficiency of financial capital and thus improve the performance by controlling the scale of the school as well as optimizing both human and material resources. Therefore, our results imply that colleges and universities should pay attention to the management of human resources, the degree of utilization of material resources, and the proper control of the scale, in order to construct a better performance evaluation system at the university level.

A design-based perspective on classroom curricular interventions may inform subsequent iterations of the design, which can benefit teachers, researchers, and students alike. Our theoretical work draws from the field of participatory design research to highlight the need for the utilization of the design framework as a metarepresentation to foster collaboration between teachers and researchers. Furthermore, it highlights six ways in which the design framework can be applied throughout the process of planning educational innovations to minimize disconnects that may occur between design, implementation, and iteration.

However, recent studies conducted in Indian metros have expressed concern about students’ mathematics learning. Except in some private coaching academies, regular classroom teaching does not include problem solving in mathematics, but is limited to mere practice exercises and drills of known exercises. For describing mathematical thinking, Schoenfeld gave a framework containing four components: resources, heuristics, controls and beliefs. Beginning in childhood we develop an ontology for the ideas we learn, and this ontology evolves as we continue learning. Ontologies used for teaching need to incorporate elements of mathematical thinking popularized by problem solving experts. So teaching that makes use of such ontologies of problems, problem solving strategies, and tasks would be beneficial to students. In this paper we identify the gaps in the literature on teaching problem solving, and discuss how and why ontologies can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics at the high school level. As a proof of concept, we describe the method by which an ontology named MONTO has been created for teaching problem solving in mathematics, and give examples of its use. We describe the MONTO ontology and compare it with some other teaching ontologies described in the literature. We developed and evaluated the MONTO ontology for Surface Area and Volume (3D Solids) problems taught as part of the national curriculum in India, and the results obtained were satisfactory: MONTO was found to be 94% robust against unseen problems in different curricula for the same domain.	heuristic (computer science);ontology (information science);problem solving	Aparna Lalingkar;Chandrashekar Ramanathan;Srinivasan Ramani	2015	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;mathematics education;word problem;social science;applied mathematics;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;reform mathematics;mathematics;sociology;management;taxonomy;pedagogy	AI	-74.85360445109566	-33.4387280578553	182649

Students in the Introduction to Phonetics course are also diverse in other ways: in age (many are returning to school after years away), in major (the course serves Linguistics and Speech u0026 Hearing), and in preparation (there are no prerequisites, but many students have some related coursework). The focus of this paper is how this student population affects how I teach phonetics online. Design goals for the course include the needs to challenge students intellectually, but still meet them “where they are” in terms of background, knowledge and interests; to balance the desire for flexibility against the need for forward progress through the course content; to combat the isolation that can affect online students; and to implement “best practices” in instruction, interaction, assessment, and evaluation.The key strategy that was adopted is to provide numerous options for learning the con...

In this perspective, the paper addresses two objectives which, although distinct, are connected by the same theoretical–epistemological reference, pointing to language as an essential tool through which individuals constitute themselves as historical and cultural subjects. The conclusions tend to show that the formation of teachers in virtual learning environments may favor the construction of new knowledge based on dialogic and collaborative network communication. In this sense, it is possible to build a construction space of the senses for the visually impaired in learning processes utilizing educational strategies which also allow for dialogues and the construction and diffusion of knowledge.	collaborative network	Elmara Pereira de Souza;Claudia Pinto Sena;Cláudia Vivien Carvalho de Oliveira Soares	2010				Web+IR	-72.87330376033538	-37.47320774902722	183771

The purpose of this study is to better understand how differences in user traits (e.g., age, gender, and technological expertise) may be impacting the use of technologies to support instruction. In this study, we report data from a university-wide survey of faculty at the University of Washington (N = 547). Study results indicate that individuals with technical expertise at the ‘‘beginner’’ level rely on different sources of support and encounter different barriers than do individuals at the ‘‘expert’’ level, even after controlling for gender and age. Our data demonstrate the importance of recognizing the range of expertise that exist among users when assessing barriers and implementing programs to support faculty in the adoption of educational technologies.	fits	Cara A.

For Irish preuniversity students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students participated in the workshop and completed pre- and post-surveys, and a free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in computing. Analysis revealed that students’ motivation to learn about the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in the computing word associations, with students associating computing more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as the Internet.

In this paper, the context of KM is placed on the campus of higher education. A knowledge capturing tool, in the form of a tablet based APP, is introduced to capture problem solving knowledge during a student project meeting. This tool intends to propose a new way of technology support to codify knowledge during socialization. A series of comparative experiments were undertaken to investigate the APP’s influence on users’ meeting experiences. This paper will present results based on interviews with the participants, which showed both positive and negative effects of the APP usage on their meeting experience.	computer science;experiment;knowledge management;operations research;personalization;socialization;tablet computer	Xiaozhen Dai;M.

The future classroom is the cradle (for students) and the action field (for teachers) of a knowledge worker. It incarnates the vision for learning and teaching with the use of Information, Communications and Technology tools (ICT) in order to provide to the students significant 21st century skills such as personal and social responsibility, critical thinking, digital competence, as well as collaboration and communication abilities. From the teacher’s point of view it demands understanding and creative use of ICT tools, organizational and administrative competences, use of up-to-date teaching scenarios, intuitive assessment methods and most of all a “lead and teach by example” attitude. Building the future classroom is all about delivering competent and effective people to the society, people that will be the key stakeholders in a world that seeks innovation and creativity in order to keep going socially, scientifically, economically, etc. In this paper we will provide insights about the reasons why a future classroom teacher should afford 21st century skills to his students and continuous professional development to himself.

These changes not only attempt to include new areas of teaching but also to make teaching goals more obligatory than they used to be in previous curricula concepts. A lot of teachers prefer not to regulate their students' knowledge acquisition process in the field of new media. Experience with new media in school however shows that it is necessary for all pupils to possess basic knowledge. In a second step this knowledge can be employed in projects of various types. For these types of projects to be conducted successfully students also need to have learning, creative and communicative skills. So teaching these skills ought to be part of a concept for implementing new media in schools too. The authors of this article, with the help of their colleagues at Gymnasium Ottobrunn, have developed a concept which enables students to obtain skills for using new media as well as learning, creative and communicative skills.

6d605761c96fb19801aa5e10d975db02b796c688	from facilitator to knowledge-builder: a new role for the teacher of the future	new role;collaboration;ict	The influence of constructivism and the spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) in classrooms are both expected to change the role of the teacher in the classroom from the expert dispensing knowledge, to the facilitator of student learning (Dwyer, Ringstaff and Sandholtz 1991, Hadley and Sheingold 1993, Ravitz, Becker and Wong 2000). In such a studentcentred classroom the teacher is expected to understand individual learning styles and appropriate means to scaffold learning while social constructivism emphasises student collaboration and interaction with the learning context. The notion of the teacher as facilitator in a student-centred classroom may have been useful to progress pedagogical thinking, but limits attempts to create a knowledge-building community which requires social relations to be reconceptualised. Some suggest that the focus should be on learning-centredness (Marzano 1992) and many teachers using ICT are happy to acknowledge that they are themselves learners rather than experts. Further, economic and educational imperatives, and the frequent complaint that teachers have “no time” now require that teachers engage in a community of practice where their own learning activities are purposeful and authentic because they are situated within their work (Brown and Campione 1994, Lave and Wenger 1994). This community can include teachers and students as co-learners, while technology as a communication medium opens up the possibility for collaboration within and across schools and with other learning partners locally and internationally.	donald becker;hadley centre for climate prediction and research;pedagogical agent;situated;social constructivism	Elizabeth Hartnell-Young	2003			engineering;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-74.36238704500258	-35.547746760299084	186138

While investigating the important theme of fast-paced development of emerging technologies in mobile communications, it is important to recognize the extent influence of these innovations using which society can communicate, learn, access information, and, additionally, interact. In addition, the usage of mobile technology in higher education needs not only the pervasive nature of the technology but also its disruptive nature that offers several challenges while incorporation in the area of teaching and learning. Therefore, recently, higher education institutions are looking at various ways of implementing m-Learning strategies, in order to offer solutions, which, in turn, can standardize the process of education and, additionally, replace those traditional didactic courses, focusing on m-Learning's endless benefits. Some of the benefits are: the process of learning itself could be self-paced, whereas information could be easier accessed, adding to independent, discovery-oriented learning that becomes more engaging. Applying CMM successfully to design effective incorporation strategies of m-Learning, this research targets formulation of such a maturity model by which the process of m-Learning can be more effective and efficient.	capability maturity model;computer;didactic organisation;mobile device;pervasive informatics;statistical model	Muasaad Alrasheedi;Luiz Fernando Capretz	2013	International Conference on Information Society (i-Society 2013)		further education;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;operating system;multimedia;mobile computing;management;world wide web;capability maturity model	HCI	-75.18214240049252	-37.600395417767714	187648

One way of achieving these goals is by increasing the ecological literacy (i.e., ecoliteracy) of our students. In order to be effective, ecoliteracy should be taught not only in environmental studies classes, but rather across the institutional curriculum. In this paper we present three activities designed to be used in the first week of class in an introductory Database Systems course. Our activities promote critical thinking, systemic thinking, ethical behavior, and an increased awareness of ecological problems -- building blocks that set up the stage for teaching ecoliteracy.	computer science;database;systemics	Daniela Inclezan;Luis Pradanos	2014		10.1145/2538862.2538909	knowledge management;critical thinking;management science;sustainability;pedagogy	AI	-75.16660091430501	-33.78070430162693	188706

The overall aim of this study is to develop knowledge about what is required by nursing students in order to coordinate and sustain knowledge through the use of MRs. The theoretical approach to learning that has been adopted implies that learning takes place in social activities, and empirically this means that the study of learning and professional knowledge is a matter of studying activities where, for example, technologies are put into practical use, where experience and knowledge are brought to life. The data consists of observations of five nursing students during their second year in nursing school, interviews and ten video-recordings from shift reports. The result shows that nursing students regularly use MRs as a source of information and that they are struggling with transforming that information into action-oriented knowledge. The conclusion is that information systems such as MRs need to be understood and defined by teachers as materials and devices created or adapted to solving practical problems, and should be treated thereafter. Providers of education need to take into account the different types of intellectual or practical knowledge that professionals like nurses are expected to have, where the use of technology cannot be separated from, but need to be integrated into other aspects of knowledge.

Indicators, such as the students' fair achievement in the National Examination of Courses and the empirical academic life experience, have evidenced important frailties in the educational process of these professionals, by and large as reflections from existing problems of the pedagogical projects in the Courses of Management around the nation. This study was therefore carried out through a participating research with members from the Curriculum Committee in the Board of Representatives of the Business Administration Course at the State University of Londrina (UEL). From a process of data collection, analysis and reflection, such frailties were tried to be understood. A methodology was designed to define the professionals profile and an alternative innovating structure for the formation of managers was proposed. This structure was composed of four large educational blocks, each of them sub-divided in thematic focuses and supported by the notion of processes. Also, a business and management laboratory, based on the technology of business games and integrated to the Internet, was developed as a didactic and pedagogical practice associated to the structure proposed. The fundamental assumption was that such propositions could surpass those frailties identified in the professional formation of managers and provide for a higher quality education through the provision of certain sets of skills for today's business setting. The qualitative analysis made by UEL's Curriculum Committee of the structure proposed for the professional education and the laboratory, which resulted from this study, associated with the argumentative considerations in the work, specially in the Conclusion section, and also the tests taken during the laboratory modules by undergraduate and post-graduate students, prove the proposals as consistent and appropriate for the formation of managers, contributing to the reduction of currently existing frailties.	amiga reflections;internet;process (computing);unified expression language	Paulo da Costa Lopes	2001			sociology	HCI	-76.86686195481163	-32.24311154578111	189844

e00c34d52966fc87a38079198eba5ddd2cee7c76	orchestration: providing teachers with scaffolding to address curriculum standards and students. pace of learning		While investment in technology for use in the classroom is increasing, studies still do not reveal significant improvements in learning. Investigations have shown that aligning the design of learning experiences with students’ needs creates synergy in the teaching and learning classroom processes. This can be achieved through orchestration, the guided integration of conventional and digital resources. This study seeks to investigate how orchestration increases student learning while taking into consideration their different pace of learning and monitoring the standards that the curriculum requires of a teacher. This is done by adopting a model which incorporates both the requirements of a school system’s curriculum, as well as the students’ specific needs based on their effective learning. It also seeks to determine which elements enrich the learning experience within an orchestrated framework. This study experimentally shows a significant increase in student learning when orchestrations are made available to teachers, when teachers successfully integrate technology into the classroom and when systematic use of the available resources is made. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the importance of addressing weaknesses in each student’s base of knowledge by adapting the activities in the classroom to their individual pace of learning.	addressing mode;experience;experiment;orchestration (computing);requirement;synergy	Anita Díaz;Miguel Nussbaum;Hugo Nopo;Carolina Maldonado-Carreño;Javier Corredor	2015	Educational Technology & Society			AI	-75.54607620844855	-37.558554522295076	191727

In this paper we argue that key qualifications, IT skills, and IT or media literacy can not be reduced to the teaching of applicational aspects, that is, to the functional characteristics of the IT systems in question. Instead, IT key qualifications consist in knowledge about the concepts of computer science.  Applying the concept of educational lenses (described in previous papers) to a course on IT key qualifications, we are able to obtain a more focused approach towards a definition of IT skills.	computer science	Christina Dörge;Carsten Schulte	2008		10.1145/1384271.1384350	digital divide;computer science;media literacy;pedagogy	HCI	-74.85323460805348	-36.205856280507774	192171
0a15db296548f311d0f3e629bac868f179479a53	exploring student and supervisor interaction during the scipro thesis process: two use cases		Common problems identified by students during their interaction with supervisors are too little instructions as well as infrequent and insufficient supervisor feedback. The SciPro system has been developed to tackle these problems. This paper describes, analyze and discuss the interaction between students and supervisors using the SciPro system. Through two use cases involving two supervisors and 38 bachelor and master students, the authors show that the structure implemented in SciPro supports and allows for different pedagogical approaches and supervision styles. Ten different types of interactions in the thesis process are identified. In order to explain why some students do not complete within the timeframe, the authors identify six categories of problems: 1 language skills, 2 inability to apply research methods, 3 ability for self-study, 4 lack of creativity, 5 limited knowledge about how to write academic work, and 6 lack of motivation. The collaborative stage of group-supervision may be one possible way to deal with the different type of support for the process of managing student theses.

For instance, game technology has influenced children's lifestyle. Due to that we have attempted to use 3D digital technology related to Web-based Virtual Reality to support learning and teaching actions in the context of K-12 Education.  In this paper, we present educational actions that we have carried out for improving K-12 children and educators' digital literacy with focus on ongoing work developments and results.  We have achieved qualitative results, showing an enormous potential for stimulating individuals' motivation/will and development in places under social and economic disadvantage. The results have been reached through computer supported collaborative and interdisciplinary learning experiences; young children's cognitive and technical skills development for using Web-based Virtual Reality tools and techniques with autonomy; including basic and higher education collaborative work.  We have observed an increase on individuals' engagement with technology, which has supported ones' sustainable knowledge based interactions and technical skills improvements in diverse contexts. Citizens' technical knowledge domain has brought about ones' awareness and cultural transformation related to use information and communication resources better as lifelong learning companion as well as approximating individuals from arts, culture, science and contemporary technology.	accessibility;autonomy;computer graphics;digital electronics;experience;interaction;virtual reality	Jorge Ferreira Franco;Roseli de Deus Lopes	2009		10.1145/1666611.1666626	knowledge base;educational technology;information visualization;digital art;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;multimedia;lifelong learning;cognitive development;higher education;culture	HCI	-70.4184420829634	-37.693716902769076	192289

Numbers of students are increasing, some students pay for studies and require more flexible teaching, more students have access to Internet, the learning material is changing rapidly (especially of subjects, related to information technologies), publishing industry is slow and expensive. All that stimulates usage of modern technologies in education. Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) is one of the forms of e-learning. They open new ways of teaching and communication such as management of online learning, course delivery mechanism, communication and assessment tools, student tracking, access to electronic resources, etc. All these means correspond to the needs of contemporary teachers and students. VLEs have primarily been used for distance education but they are being used increasingly as supplement of traditional classroom based education. The author is interested in this latter aspect of VLEs. The paper briefly reviews main types of Virtual Learning Environments and analyses the use of VLEs in Lithuania. The results of the investigation of two different learning environments – traditional (Web CT) and collaborative (FLE3) at the Vilnius Pedagogical University are also discussed in the article.	internet;item unique identification;upload	Joana Lipeikiene	2003	Informatics in Education		collaborative learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;simulation;adult education;blended learning;engineering;knowledge management;experiential learning;instructional simulation;learning sciences;teaching method;multimedia;active learning;open learning;synchronous learning;virtual learning environment	HCI	-76.68534197282247	-37.14081337146521	192885

Virtual Classroom (VCR) is one of the ways of providing virtual education. In this article, we demonstrate that VCR can be effective, when compared to traditional classroom, by the right use of technology (like interwise), people (Subject Matter Expert), process (initial set-up and scheduling) and infrastructure (network, bandwidth). Significant efforts have been made to provide different technology based solutions. The virtual classroom (VCR) is one of them which is a learning environment in virtual space. It provides the advantages of classroom learning as well as virtual learning. It provides a better utilization of resources and time. This paper provides an analysis of VCR vs the traditional classroom taking the cost factor as ac attribute.

37946232125d1bbb544bc3c5beb8eb6c2c74f851	enabling professional development with e-portfolios: creating a space for the private and public self		Portfolios have been used for assessment in higher education as an alternative to exams and assignments. E-portfolios offer staff a digital technology that can be both a personalised learning space, owned and controlled by the learner, and a presentation tool which can be used for formal assessment purposes. However, this can result in a tension between process and product, where e-portfolios become electronic repositories of resources that simply tick boxes for career progression. The paper reports on a project that investigated the use of e-portfolios by teaching practitioners developing a critical portfolio of evidence for an award-bearing academic development programme. An e-portfolio had been adopted to address criticisms that conventional assessment fails to take account of the context in which teaching practitioners operate. The project aimed to enable teaching practitioners to access and gain familiarity with peda-gogically sound e-portfolio opportunities. In addition, it aimed to foster a reflective approach, promote critical thinking focused on learning and teaching and enhance continuing professional development.	color gradient;digital electronics	Simon Lygo-Baker;Stylianos Hatzipanagos	2012	IJOPCD	10.4018/ijopcd.2012010103	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;pedagogy	HCI	-76.23690122107476	-35.07084394362938	194467

35e1abc82c1b0d17b2b05a9cdb97db2ec8d20e33	the educators' telescope to the future of technology		We live in a world of accelerating changes, where technology plays an important role as an enabler. Looking ahead means being prepared for these changes. Preparedness may be reactive - reacting to the situation at the moment something happens; proactive - being prepared in advance for a situation that may happen; or preactive - being able in advance to affect something that may happen in the future and how it happens. Forecasting the future helps us to be prepared for new situations. It is based on making predictions that are derived from understanding past and present data. Known data is organized in the form of trends and further extrapolated to cover the future. From the technical point of view, there are a variety of approaches for forecasting: algorithmic, simulation, statistical analysis etc. The methods used may be quantitative (future data is seen as a function of past data) or qualitative (subjective, based on the opinion or judgment of the target group used in the analysis). Technology is an essential part of education, both in supporting effective learning and as a content of teaching itself. As a result, every educator needs skills to analyze the future of relevant technologies. In this paper, we introduce a framework that can be used in analysis of the importance of technological changes in education and as a part of curricula. The approach is based on trend analysis and classification of the relevant technologies to take into account the time span of their effects in society. The question we answer in this paper is “How can an educator analyze the consequences of technological changes in their work?”.	algorithm;extrapolation;simulation;statistical classification	Hannu Jaakkola;Jaak Henno;Bernhard Thalheim;Jukka Mäkelä	2017	2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973506	preparedness;technological change;knowledge management;market research;curriculum;management science;trend analysis;computer science	HCI	-73.18519971709267	-31.83774259494498	195402
3187f78b00c5747ae0965d412b68f8a947d520b2	promoting team learning in the classroom		The new workplace is a key arena for learning in today’s society. The spiraling demand for knowledge in the workplace has increased interest in learning, especially team learning. Team learning can be viewed from multiple perspectives, making it difficult for career and technical educators (CTEs) to know how to prepare students for a team-based work environment, especially one that includes virtual teams. In addition, emerging technology adds to the confusion about how to provide effective learning experiences that mirror what is occurring in the workplace. To prepare the workforce of tomorrow, CTE instructors can become facilitators of team learning by providing ample opportunity for learners to practice team skills in a low-risk learning environment. By providing the exposure and practice to team learning skills and technology tools, CTEs may help equip students with added skills in entering a global workplace.

Sustainable development goal (SDG) 4, for example, moves beyond measures of access and increasingly focuses on the sustainability of education including issues of educational quality and student outcomes. A reassessment of how ICT in education is measured to support the attainment of the SDGs by 2030 is thus a timely endeavour. The paper discusses four aspects: (1) evolving mission, methods and core principles of ICT in learning and teaching; (2) nature of ICT in education in accelerating the emergence of new learner-centred pedagogies; (3) types of learning activities associated with the use of ICT including those for leaders, teachers and students; and (4) usage and deployment patterns. This paper proposes extensions and adaptions to the existing UIS data collection instrument to enrich its capacity for understanding how ICT is being used in learning and teaching.	emergence;endeavour (supercomputer);itil;keystroke-level model;knowledge society;learner-generated context;noise shaping;refinement (computing);software deployment;user-centered design	David Gibson;Tania Broadley;Jill Downie;Peter Wallet	2018	Educational Technology & Society		computer science;data collection;knowledge management;baseline (configuration management);statistics education;information and communications technology;information technology	HCI	-75.5535802058597	-33.41512676686369	195552

M. Wing to indicate a set of analytical skills regarded necessary for the youth in the modern information society [11]. We describe an ongoing research project on CT skills in the Netherlands, focusing on the computer science (CS) course in the upper grades of secondary education. In the first phase of the project we explore the occurrence and nature of CT aspects in the CS teaching materials and policy documents as well as teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In this poster we describe the research design and the method of the first phase of the project and we report and discuss the results obtained so far, focusing on the teachers' perspective.	computation;computational thinking;computer science	Natasa Grgurina;Erik Barendsen;Bert Zwaneveld;Klaas van Veen;Idzard Stoker	2014		10.1145/2670757.2670761	mathematics education;applied mathematics;computer science;pedagogy	AI	-75.10224306439103	-33.41824994429935	197901

2ff53c0b588502e8c49549e23b5bb0bc1ff484f2	the impacts of deaf culture on designing with deaf children		This paper will discuss the impacts Deaf culture and the traits of individual Deafness have on the conduct of co-design with Deaf children. A series of design sessions were undertaken with a design team composed of young Deaf children, the first author as an adult designer, members of an Early Childhood Development Program's staff, and the parents of the young Deaf children. From the interactions of the design team, lessons about the impact of Deaf culture and individual Deafness have been identified. Designers wishing to work with young Deaf children must consider the impacts Deafness and Deaf culture will have on their design activities if they wish to maximise Deaf children's involvement in and contribution to those design activities.
