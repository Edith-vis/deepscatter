c7f3623f51d66534f9b0b9eedbf52df1151f68f8	untersuchung von multipass-strategien für das rcpsp/prax		A method and apparatus for applying iontophoretic treatment to a living body is provided by which a unidirectional treatment current is periodically interrupted by a relatively short pulse of current in the opposite direction in order to prevent the formation of undesirable vesicles and bulla in the skin being treated. The apparatus and method are arranged to impose the treatment current gradually at the beginning of each treatment.	regin (malware)	Axel Holland;Jörg Homberger;Hermann Gehring	2008			systems engineering;biomedical engineering;bulla (amulet);pulse (signal processing);computer science	Crypto	84.07738484364315	-17.621111982631533	192176

A pair of lever arms pivotally secured to an edge portion of the retainer plates and pivotally joined together at one end are acted upon by leaf springs which engage the lever arms at selected positions relative to the pivotal connection for adjusting the resilient flex between the pair of retainer plates. Mastic material is fed into the cavity through a socket bracket that is mounted to one of the retainer plates to which there is also mounted an alignment wheel.

In this processing, the key part is to extract the coupling voltage signals that are sensed by the sensing coils as accurately as possible, because it will affect the precision of location directly. However, in the real system, these coupling voltage signals are very weak and be drowned in noises. In this paper, we propose three methods to extract this signal accurately, which are phase lock amplifier, function fitting and Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). Also we make theoretical analysis and emulation for each method, and show their experimental results. After sedulous comparison, we conclude function fitting is the most suitable method for this system.	amplifier;arnold tongue;constraint algorithm;curve fitting;emulator;fast fourier transform;fastest;transmitter	Xiaojing Wang;Shuang Song;Chao Hu	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723494	control engineering;computer vision;fast fourier transform;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	89.25696880132118	-22.195430322952685	197391
d6cd73fb8d69cb8c7f60de31b00073b5dd048c10	automatische versus manuelle kapitelgliederung bzw. registererzeugung, dargestellt am beispiel einer soziologischen bibliographie		A device for use in replacing a bowstring of a compound bow and for storing a compound bow in a partially de-tensioned condition without the need to retune the compound bow upon replacement of the bowstring. A connector including a socket for holding a bowstring fastener which is fixed on the end of one of the cables, and a retainer for maintaining the connector in engagement with the cable, are located at each end of elongate linking means including a lever-operated tensioner. The device is installed on the cables of a compound bow while the bowstring is installed, and the lever-operated tensioner is used to slacken the bowstring, allowing its replacement or removal. With the bowstring removed from the fastener the tensioning device may be extended to reduce tension on the bow to a value below that existent when the bowstring is installed, without completely loosening the cables. A turnbuckle is provided to enable the device to be adjusted for use with compound bows having bowstrings of various lengths. A second embodiment of the device includes a plurality of attachment points for the turnbuckle to provide a greater range of adjustability of effective length.

8e40681c6b292bf9bc69b9d3a47e55b14c4a11a6	the snellen human calorimeter revisited, re-engineered and upgraded: design and performance characteristics	whole body;real time;measurement system;human calorimetry thermometry;eddy current;thermogenesis;thermolysis;relative humidity;flow measurement;heat loss;hygrometry	The measurement of whole body heat loss in humans and the performance characteristics of a modified Snellen whole body air calorimeter are described. Modifications included the location of the calorimeter in a pressurized room, control of operating temperature over a range of  − 15 to + 35°C, control of ambient relative humidity over a range of 20–65%, incorporation of an air mass flow measuring system to provide real time measurement of air mass flow through the calorimeter, incorporation of a constant load ‘eddy current’ resistance ergometer and an open circuit, expired gas analysis calorimetry system. The performance of the calorimeter is a function of the sensitivity, precision, accuracy and response time characteristics of the fundamental measurement systems including: air mass flow; thermometry and hygrometry. Calibration experiments included a calibration of the air mass flow sensor, the response of the thermometric measurement system for dry heat loss and the response of the hygrometric measurement system for evaporative heat loss. The air mass flow system was evaluated using standard differential temperature procedures to demonstrate linearity and sensitivity of the device. A novel procedure based on differential hygrometry was developed to ascertain the absolute calibration of air mass flow by resolving the unique system coefficient K. The results of the hygrometric calibration demonstrate the air mass flow response of the system is linear over the range of air mass flows from 6 to 15 kg min−1. R 2 was 0.995. The average half response time (tR50) was 14.5 ± 2.1 s. Similarly the results of the thermometric calibration demonstrate that the response of the apparatus is linear over the range of power input measured (coefficient of linearity R 2 = 0.9997) with a precision of 0.72 W and an accuracy to within 0.36 W. The average (tR50) over all conditions was 6.0 ± 1.9 min. In summary, modifications brought to the Snellen calorimeter have significantly improved the precision, accuracy and response time characteristics of the previous system while extending its operating range.	calibration;calorimetry;cessation of life;coefficient;erewhon;experiment;flow;heat loss;maxima and minima;response time (technology);snellen chart;system of measurement;thermometry	Francis D.

Each photosensitive layer is comprised of an upper transparent continuous electrode sublayer, a photoconductive sublayer, and a back mosaic electrode sublayer which is electrically connected to said base. When light strikes the outermost photosensitive layer, light of a particular color is absorbed, and in connection with said base, its presence is electrically detected and recorded. The unabsorbed light continues to travel and strike the next succeeding photosensor layer whereat another color of light is absorbed and detected. The unabsorbed light passing through the second photosensor layer strikes the innermost photosensor layer which detects the remaining light. The photosensor layers are electrically insulated from each other and the base and make possible detection of three separate colors of light such as blue, green and red without the use of multi-color filter arrays.	enigma machine	Louis Kruh	2005	Cryptologia	10.1080/01611190508951316	algorithm;electrode;photodetector;optics;photoconductivity;computer science	Vision	85.4966030958198	-19.12949256393556	199134

An ion beam received through either one or both ends of the open cylindrical target is forced by a negative bias applied to the target to diverge so that ions impinge at acute angles at different points of the cylindrical target surface. The ion impingement results in a radially inward and downstream directed flux of sputter deposit particles that are received by the substrate. A positive bias applied to the substrate enhances divergence of the approaching ion beams to generate a higher sputtered deposition flux rate. Alternatively, a negative bias applied to the substrate induces the core portion of the ion beams to reach the substrate and provide ion polishing of the sputtered deposit thereon.
