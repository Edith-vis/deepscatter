A working fluid is accelerated from the charged electrode to the ground electrode by a high electric field. The electric body force responsible for this acceleration is primarily the Coulomb force. To increase the electric filed at low applied voltage, the electrode gap between the charged and ground electrodes is reduced to 0.2 mm. The size of the present EHD pump is 24×30×7.8 mm3, in which ten pairs of electrodes are fabricated. In order to generate oscillating flows, the sinusoidal wave voltage and the rectangular wave voltage are applied. The present EHD pump is demonstrated to successfully generate oscillating flows at low frequencies (0.01 Hz ~ 5 Hz).	discharger;displacement mapping;experiment	Ichiro Kano	2010	2010 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2010.5616852	materials science;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry	Robotics	89.36210528316842	-16.553511604700272	191260

Dielectric liquid of HFE-7100(3M), which has a boiling point of 59.8°C, was selected as a working fluid. In order to generate high electric fields with the application of low voltages, a micro patterned electrode with an array of planar comb finger was made by micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technology. The electrode had ten slits whose width was 400μm between electrode pairs so as to remove vapor bubbles from a heat transfer surface by the electro static force. A cooling device fabricated with the electrode was evaluated by different applied voltages. As a result, the application of voltage enhanced heat transfer.	computer cooling;cryptographic hash function;experiment;heat sink;instability;microelectromechanical systems;neurotrophic electrode	Ichiro Kano;Yohei Takahashi	2012	2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2012.6373986	materials science;ceramic materials;electronic engineering;analytical chemistry	Robotics	89.80644744560749	-16.460609702456544	192209
b052d99abb5989fc88f328cbceaa4a333e247b3f	improvement of surface integrity of cold forging tools by adaption of tool making process		Cold forging enables mass production of steel based components. High loads within cold forging presuppose high loadable tool materials. This is why apart from tool steels cemented carbides are mainly used as tool materials. Due to brittleness of these materials, fatigue is one of the major limits of tool life. Tool manufacturing requires a combination of hard machining and subsequent machining steps. For hard machining of complex tool geometries electrical discharge machining (EDM) represents the industrial standard. The thermal influenced surface layer has to be removed by post and fine machining steps. The resulting surface integrity has a major influence on the internal strength of a tool. Correlations between tool manufacturing, surface properties and tool behavior will gain knowledge for an optimized tool production. In this context, scope of the present paper are the investigation and description of the interactions between tool manufacturing and resulting surface properties for tools made of cemented carbide and tool steel. Within the article, the surface properties caused by a conventional process chain consisting of EDM and polishing are quantified. In addition, these results are compared to an adapted process chain with an integrated peening process. The results reveal that the conventional and the adapted process chain lead to similar surface topographies and roughness values. However, the integration of a peening process shifts the residual stress level towards higher compressive stresses.

9ef7d13e52c7e82c14371714ed13060f9f2e8814	experimental analysis of sn-3.0ag-0.5cu solder joint board-level drop/vibration impact failure models after thermal/isothermal cycling		Abstract Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu board-level lead-free solder joint drop (1000g, 1 ms)/vibration (15g, 25–35 Hz) reliability after thermal (− 40–125 °C, 1000 cycle)/isothermal (150 °C, 500 h) cycling was reported in this study. The failure performance of solder joint and testing life were analyzed under design six testing conditions (1. Single drop impact, 2. Order thermal cycling and drop impact, 3. Order isothermal cycling and drop impact, 4. Single vibration 5. Order thermal cycling and vibration 6. Order isothermal cycling and vibration). The results revealed that the pre-cracks initiation during thermal cycling do not affect the solder joint drop impact reliability, but decrease the vibration reliability. The formation of voids weaken both drop and vibration reliability of solder joint. After thermal cycling, the crack initiated from β-Sn near IMC layer, and continued propagation through the same path when under second in order vibration impact. But propagation path turn to IMC layer when under second in order drop impact. The drop life increases from 41 times to 49 times, and vibration life decrease from 77 min to 45 min. After isothermal cycling, the formation of voids let the cracks occurred at IMC layer under second in order no matter drop impact or vibration. The drop and vibration life is 19 times and 62 min respectively.	soldering;thermal grease	Jian Hua Gu;Jian Lin;Yongping Lei;Hanguang Fu	2018	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2017.10.014	electronic engineering;engineering;drop impact;isothermal process;soldering;cycling;temperature cycling;vibration;thermal	NLP	88.81005203262828	-12.35522049375359	193517

It employs the viscoplastic strain, which was originally given by Perzyna and extended by Murakami to consider the effect of damage. The unified form of damage evolution equation given by Lemaitre is extended to consider the effect of damage type and strain rate. The constitutive modeling is identified, based on static/dynamic tensile tests and fatigue tests for steel (SM490A) and aluminum (2219-T87). The identified models are used to predict the static/dynamic, tensile behaviors of pre-strained steel and pre-fatigued aluminum. The predicted results have agreed well with the corresponding experimental results.	computation	Yutaka Toi;Satoshi Hirose	2004	International Journal of Computational Engineering Science	10.1142/S1465876304002356	materials science;structural engineering;composite material;forensic engineering;physics	SE	85.12567024426338	-12.28968241416157	193807

371581a8e57f23fc8f964893f3e2d254b6b34dc9	static intercept∗ technology: a new packaging platform for corrosion and esd protection		Telecommunications providers expect products to perform reliably during operation in the field. Achieving the expected hardware reliability is due to an amalgamation of multiple factors. A significant contribution to reliable performance results from the incorporation of specific materials, which are very corrosion resistant and electrostatic discharge (ESD) safe during the design and manufacturing phases of the equipment life cycle. Environmental protection must be given to products to ensure that the products retain designed reliability during global storage and transport. There will be cases of material corrosion with as-received or stored products and there are many instances of “less than ideal” storage conditions for our products (e.g., customer warehouses without air-conditioning or environmental controls). We have developed a strategy to mitigate these problems by the use of a Static Intercept∗ packaging platform. This technology simultaneously protects equipment and components from corrosion, moisture, and ESD in a single packaging material for seven years or longer. The technical merits of Static Intercept, which currently provides the longest available protection against corrosion and ESD degradation, will be discussed in terms of addressing these storage issues.	discharger;electrostatic loudspeaker;elegant degradation;getty thesaurus of geographic names;messier object;mint;museum informatics;nichols plot;visual intercept;windows aero	John P.

Results show that the best values of cooling module are 1.1 mm aluminum fin thickness, 7.5 mm pitch, and 31 mm height and can effectively reduce the LED junction temperature under 75 1C at 901 incline angle. The impact of the incline angle of the LED vapor chamber-based plate to the thermal performance of the present cooling module should be assessed before such a structure of vapor chamber cooling system is used to cool high power LED system. And the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results, whose calculating error is not more than 710%. A novel comparative process of 230 W LED projection light is developed. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

89ad7fe8ff0691d03831801f6c1891a082ccb0a2	development of rubber aging life prediction software		Raw rubber or rubber items are vulnerable to heat, oxygen, light and other factors during the processing, storing or using, due to exposure to the natural environment or a particular working environment, and easy to undergo physical or chemical change, such as the softening, sticky for crude rubber, and cracking, mildewy and brittle for rubber products which would degrade the material prop‐ erties or even make it unusable. The loss of property caused by such rubber aging is up to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Therefore how to accurately predict the rubber aging life and how to choose the appropriate test method are especially important for the selection of suitable rubber and reduction of the cost of existing aging experiment. Based on the summarizing and comparison of various kinds of rubber fatigue aging theories and experiment methods, a predicting rubber aging life software with VC++ programming language was developed. The software structure mainly included the theoretical prediction module, the commonly used rubber material data module, user guidance module. It could be used to predict rubber fatigue life, optimize the product material and help the manufacturing process more efficient implementation.	database;human–computer interaction;model selection;password cracking;programming language;softening;sticky bit;theory;turing test;usability	Hong He;Kai Liu;Xuelei Fu;Kehan Ye	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65298-6_74	engineering;natural rubber;softening;control engineering;software;brittleness;process engineering;material properties;test method;raw rubber;cracking	HCI	87.98442551976134	-11.54905822004959	197845

As a result, ingress of liquid water and harmful ions such as chlorides or sulphates dissolved in water is prevented. In practice, concrete structures are usually cracked. Cracks serve as preferential paths for ingress of water and chloride dissolved in water. The efficiency of water repellent surface impregnation has been studied. Recommendations for applications in practice can be formulated. If cracks occur after surface impregnation, it may be necessary to repeat the protective treatment. Mechanically induced damage (micro-cracks) usually reduces durability of concrete. The reduction of service life of reinforced concrete structures can be avoided if the surface is impregnated with silane. Surface impregnation delays initiation of corrosion in aggressive environment significantly. If chloride contaminated concrete is surface impregnated with silane, the rate of corrosion is reduced.

Perforations in microstructures are often used to control the squeeze-film damping in micro-resonators. To model the perforation effects on the squeeze-film damping, many analytical models have been proposed, however, most of the previous models have been concerned with the squeeze-film damping due to the normal motion between the perforated vibrating plate and a fixed substrate, while there is a lack of works that model the squeeze-film damping of perforated torsion microplates, which are also widely used in MEMS devices. This paper presents an analytical model for the squeeze-film damping of perforated torsion microplates. The derivation in this paper is based on a modified Reynolds equation that includes compressibility and rarefaction effects. The pressure distribution under the vibrating plate is obtained using the double sine series. Closed-form expressions for the stiffness and the damping coefficients of the squeeze-film are derived. The accuracy of the model is verified by comparing its results with the finite element method (FEM) results and the experimental results available in the literature. The regime of validity and limitations of the present model are assessed.	coefficient;dystonia musculorum deformans;finite element method;medical device material perforation;microelectromechanical systems;torsion (gastropod);squeeze	Pu Li;Yuming Fang	2015		10.3390/s150407388	structural engineering;text mining;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;thermoelastic damping;q factor;mechanical engineering	Robotics	83.41501629095175	-12.583326981883756	199583
