48e7b38749ffcbd7f79cc36f4f6a232b77f6d06a	task allocation methods for homogeneous multi-robot systems: feed pushing case study		The paper discuses several options to implement multi-robot systems focusing on coordination and action planning of the system. Particular implementation described in details as a case study presents a solution used in multi-robot system for feed pushing in cattle farm. The paper describes implementation of behavior based robot team control and two different path planning methods ensuring that the feed pushing work is done properly. Conclusions outline suggestions for practical implementations regardless of particular application domain.	application domain;behavior tree;computation;embedded system;fault tolerance;motion planning;robot;run time (program lifecycle phase);smoothing	Agris Nikitenko;Egons Lavendelis;Martins Ekmanis;Roberts Rumba	2018	Automatic Control and Computer Sciences	10.3103/S0146411618050097	theoretical computer science;robot;control engineering;computer science;homogeneous	Robotics	-18.82354201737288	-8.231926571544845	197741
