99a1e2ac73b73a6353b5ec0bc3485f0553301bbf	a distributed core network architecture for 5g systems and beyond		"""This paper presents a distributed core network architecture for use in future cellular systems. The proposed architecture addresses the performance bottlenecks and latency associated with the centralized control and data gateways used in today's mobile core networks. A fully distributed architecture for the mobile core is realized through the use of identifier-based protocol extensions to IP which run on base stations (eNodeB) and routers without the need for centralized gateways. The resulting """"flat"""" mobile core network is capable of supporting a variety of mobility and IoT services with significantly lower latency and improved throughput relative to current solutions. Specific data plane service examples including service chaining and local VOIP are given. The paper concludes with an evaluation of control and data-plane overhead for a large US-scale cellular network operator in the proposed architecture."""	centralized computing;commodity computing;distributed computing;forwarding plane;identifier;network architecture;overhead (computing);router (computing);simulation;testbed;throughput;universal software radio peripheral	Shreyasee Mukherjee;Ravishankar Ravindran;Dipankar Raychaudhuri	2018		10.1145/3229574.3229583	distributed computing;computer network;architecture;computer science;enodeb;core network;voice over ip;forwarding plane;edge computing;cellular network;base station	Mobile	-14.525202800187666	85.23413213140691	192246

We start with the hypothesis that these links can be used to exchange data between the meter/controller, at the user, and a service, at the web, using application protocols (e.g., SPDY and HTTPS). This hypothesis is verified studying the connectivity capabilities/constraints that a third party service may experience in broadband links. A quantitative evaluation was performed, in an emulated IPv6 network, to delimit the throughput, latency and reliability available to smart grids services. The results showed that SPDY and HTTPS can meet typical QoS requirements using a proper architecture (e.g., centralized or distributed), and can drive the development of new web-based energy services. Here, we discuss practical connectivity aspects to deploy such services.	centralized computing;compiler;distributed computing;emulator;https;internet access;location (geography);requirement;spdy;smart tv;software deployment;surface web;throughput;web application;web development	Roberto Rigolin Ferreira Lopes;Rikke Stoud Platou;Sverre Hendseth;Nunzio Marco Torrisi;Kristoffer Nyborg Gregertsen;Geir Mathisen	2013	IEEE PES ISGT Europe 2013	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2013.6695309	embedded system;engineering;computer security;computer network	Networks	-19.051806871260165	85.25028284621689	192347

4d1826152090fefae52d42d0db4a75121e0be88f	control of multi-resource infrastructures: application to nfv and computation offloading		Network function virtualization (NFV) and Computation offloading (CO) are state-of-the-art technologies for flexible utilization of networking and processing resources. These two technologies are closely related in that they enable multiple physical entities to process a function provided in a service, and the service (or end host) chooses which resources to use. In this paper, we propose a generalized dual-resource system, which unifies NFV service and CO service frameworks, and formulate a multi-path problem for choosing resources to use in NFV and CO services. The problem is reformulated as a variational inequality by using Lagrange dual theory and saddle point theory. Based on this formulation, we propose an extragradient-based algorithm that controls and splits the sending rate of a service. We prove that the algorithm converges to an optimal point where system cost minus service utility is minimized. Simulations under diverse scenarios demonstrate that our algorithm achieves high quality of service while reducing the system cost by jointly considering dual-resource coupling and service characteristics.	algorithm;calculus of variations;computation offloading;computer simulation;display resolution;duality (optimization);entity;machine learning;master of science in information technology;mathematical optimization;multipath routing;network function virtualization;optimization problem;quality of service;social inequality;transfer function;unified framework;variational inequality;vii	Yeongjin Kim;Hyang-Won Lee;Song Chong	2018	2018 16th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.23919/WIOPT.2018.8362819	distributed computing;computer science;resource management;network functions virtualization;variational inequality;quality of service;cloud computing;computation offloading;saddle point	Mobile	-12.714971790047766	84.82089272927227	193218
c79ddcef4bdf56c5467143b32e53b23825c17eff	a framework based on sdn and containers for dynamic service chains on iot gateways		In this paper, we describe a new approach for managing service function chains in scenarios where data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices is partially processed at the network edge. Our framework is enabled by two emerging technologies, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and container based virtualization, which ensure several benefits in terms of flexibility, easy programmability, and versatility. These features are well suitable with the increasingly stringent requirements of IoT applications, and allow a dynamic and automated network service chaining. An extensive performance evaluation, which has been carried out by means of a testbed, seeks to understand how our proposed framework performs in terms of computational overhead, network bandwidth, and energy consumption. By accounting for the constraints of typical IoT gateways, our evaluation tries to shed light on the actual deployability of the framework on low-power nodes.	algorithmic efficiency;clinical act of insertion;computation;computational resource;containers;data center;data compression;deploy;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;network traffic control;next unit of computing;odroid-c2;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;requirement;sbcs;small form factor;software-defined networking;testbed;workload;benefit	Roberto Morabito;Nicklas Beijar	2017		10.1145/3094405.3094413	computer network;computer science;microservices;virtualization;overhead (computing);network service;edge device;distributed computing;energy consumption;testbed;software-defined networking	Mobile	-15.121657398034284	81.54996060921962	193577

A traditional SDN implementation relies on a logically centralized controller that runs the control plane. However, in a large-scale WAN deployment, this rudimentary centralized approach has several limitations related to performance and scalability. To address these issues, recent proposals have advocated deploying multiple controllers that work cooperatively to control a network. Nonetheless, this approach drags in an interesting problem, which we call the Dynamic Controller Provisioning Problem (DCPP). DCPP dynamically adapts the number of controllers and their locations with changing network conditions, in order to minimize flow setup time and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a framework for deploying multiple controllers within an WAN. Our framework dynamically adjusts the number of active controllers and delegates each controller with a subset of Openflow switches according to network dynamics while ensuring minimal flow setup time and communication overhead. To this end, we formulate the optimal controller provisioning problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and propose two heuristics to solve it. Simulation results show that our solution minimizes flow setup time while incurring very low communication overhead.	algorithm;centralized computing;control plane;converge;emulator;experiment;flip-flop (electronics);heuristic (computer science);linear programming;np-hardness;network switch;openflow;optimal control;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;propagation delay;provisioning;scalability;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;software-defined networking;testbed	Md.

Businesses such as fast food restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, and airports, provide complimentary Internet access to their customers through Wi-Fi networks. Clients can connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot using different wireless devices. However, network administrators may apply traffic shaping to control the wireless client's upload and download data rates. Such limitation is used to avoid overloading the hotspot, thus providing fair bandwidth allocation. Also, it allows for the collection of money from the client in order to have access to a faster Internet service. In this paper, we present a new technique to avoid bandwidth limitation imposed by Wi-Fi hotspots. The proposed method creates multiple virtual wireless clients using only one physical wireless interface card. Each virtual wireless client emulates a standalone wireless device. The combination of the individual bandwidth of each virtual wireless client results in an increase of the total bandwidth gained by the attacker. Our proposed technique was implemented and evaluated in a real-life environment with an increase in data rate up to 16 folds.	download;emulator;fast food;file transfer;function overloading;hotspot (wi-fi);internet access;java hotspot virtual machine;real life;traffic shaping;uncompressed video;upload	Omar Nakhila;Cliff Changchun Zou	2017	MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)	10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170854	traffic shaping;computer network;internet access;mobile broadband;wireless network interface controller;the internet;computer science;bandwidth allocation;hotspot (wi-fi);wi-fi	Mobile	-17.397313031658854	86.852809046105	194991
7475d16ea8076bc41c2c9980268ed7500f79b491	ipv6 and extended ipv6 (ipv6++) features that enable autonomic network setup and operation		In this paper we present an insight on the IPv6 features and a few examples of propositions for Extensions to IPv6 protocols, which enable autonomic network set-up and operation. The concept of autonomicity-realized through control-loop structures embedded within node/device architectures and the overall network architecture as a whole is an enabler for advanced self-manageability of network devices and the network as a whole. GANA Model for Autonomic networking introduces autonomic manager components at various levels of abstraction of functionality within device architectures and the overall network architecture, which are capable of performing autonomic management and control of their associated Managed-Entities (MEs) e.g. protocols, as well as cooperating with each other in driving the self-managing features of the Network(s). MEs are started, configured, constantly monitored and dynamically regulated by the autonomic managers towards optimal and reliable network services. This amounts to what we call autonomic setup and operation of the network. We present how to achieve this, and also present the features that IPv6 protocols exhibit, that are fundamental to designing and building self-configuring, self-optimizing and self-healing networks i.e. IPv6 based autonomic networks.	auto-configuration;autonomic networking;embedded system;entity;future internet;holism;network architecture;principle of abstraction	Ranganai Chaparadza;Razvan Petre;Arun Prakash;Felician Németh;Slawomir Kuklinski;Alexej Starschenko	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-20931-4_16	real-time computing;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-18.744331975402485	82.24017026520673	195270

In this model, application processes (APes) communicate via an IPC facility. The IPC processes that make up this facility provide a protocol that implements an IPC mechanism, and a protocol for managing distributed IPC (routing, security and other management tasks). Our architecture is recursive in that the IPC processes can themselves be APes requesting services from lower IPC facilities. We present the repeating patterns and structures in our architecture, and show how the proposed model would cope with the challenges faced by today's Internet (and that of the future).	inter-process communication;internet;network architecture;recursion;routing	John Day;Ibrahim Matta;Karim Mattar	2008		10.1145/1544012.1544079	real-time computing;network architecture;computer science;technical report;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network;inter-process communication	Networks	-16.75899992934784	83.82917310851217	195483

f6d64a7fa7436bd5651fc315c8f9b61245a14d7c	an integrated control of ip and optical network for multi-grade virtualized networks		In the 5G era, it is expected that various services will be provided on network slices, which are virtualized network resources. A network slice has to support isolation capabilities and multi-grade performance capabilities such as ultra-low-latency and ultra-reliability due to the 5G requirements. IP and optical networks are also required to provide multi-grade property as a part of a network slice. Multi-layer SDN control is beneficial technology to realize the multi-grade network because an integrated control of IP and optical layers enables to combine network technologies across layers. It brings flexibility of service levels in terms of network performance and reliability. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a multi-grade network which provides various types of virtualized network according to user requirements. Our platform is composed of IP and optical layers and ONOS-based SDN controller. We show on-demand provisioning of a virtualized network with a provisioning tracker that presents current status of provisioning in real-time.	graphical user interface;internet protocol suite;layer (electronics);multiprotocol label switching;network performance;provisioning;real-time clock;requirement;software-defined networking;source routing;test automation;user requirements document;web application	Takuya Tojo;Shingo Okada;Yoshiyuki Hirata;Seisho Yasukawa	2018	2018 4th IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization and Workshops (NetSoft)	10.1109/NETSOFT.2018.8459974	control theory;network performance;computer network;provisioning;transponder;routing protocol;service level;computer science;optical switch;user requirements document	Networks	-14.978764949228847	84.47310261651774	195782

The study developed in this article addresses a context-aware multiparty content delivery framework, capable of providing autonomic control of personalized group-based services to users by a hierarchical strategy with the concept of Abstract Multiparty Trees (AMTs). A thorough study of the proposed concept is presented, aiming to assess the scalability and flexibility of our framework and associated procedures. An analytical study quantifies the amount of reconfigurations and resources saved in the network whenever context changes, showing how the control framework scales when the network size increases. The evaluation through simulation analyses the performance of the proposed solution, meeting the results of the analytical study and showing a good performance regarding the reconfiguration of the AMTs in terms of time and control overhead. Finally, a proof-of-concept demonstrator is also detailed, in order to prove the feasibility of the AMT concept and the good performance of its main control operations.

RoF enables the processing of several radio frequency (RF) signals in a centralized location, reducing both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX). This paper describes a testbed of Internet-of-Things (IoT) for environmental monitoring based on RoF that is under development in the framework of the H2020 FUTEBOL project.

The availability of advanced multi-site service provisioning solutions (e.g., availability zones in Amazon EC2), is enabling the creation of advanced high-availability architectures for services and applications. These architectures, being highly distributed across cloud infrastructures, largely rely on the connectivity between DCs. While in the last years, the adoption of Software-defined Networking (SDN) solutions within a single cloud site is becoming a consolidated practice, their application across geographically separated data centre sites is still largely unexplored. In this paper we discuss how we plan to tackle this issue within the XIFI project, an EU FI-PPP program project that aims at creating a multi-site community cloud across Europe. We propose a backbone connectivity network service connecting XIFI DC sites that will leverage pan-European Network Research and Education (NREN)'s infrastructures, and advanced SDN solutions to ensure VM-to-VM connectivity across the sites while guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) Service Level Agreements (SLAs) required by the distributed services.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);central processing unit;centralized computing;cloud computing;community cloud;control system;data center;distributed computing;high availability;image scaling;internet backbone;interoperability;intranet;middleware;national research and education network;network interface controller;object access method;openflow;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scalability;service-level agreement;software deployment;software-defined networking	Eduard Escalona;José-Ignacio Aznar-Baranda;Luis Miguel Contreras Murillo;Óscar González de Dios;Giuseppe Cossu;Federico M.

It facilitates offloading simple Network Functions (NFs) onto a programmable data plane in order to reduce latency and improve device efficiency. However, these NFs enforced by different operators may be contradicted. Besides, dynamic management of NFs without interrupting the operation of a data plane is almost impossible. And operation expenditure (Opex) inevitably increases due to the need of expressing richer polices and resolving policy inconsistencies. Therefore, in this poster we propose MPVisor, a high performance hypervisor of P4 specific data plane with modular programmability, to enable isolation and dynamic management of NF instances without data plane interruption. We implement MPVisor and evaluate several benchmarks by comparing with equivalent baseline applications implemented in Hyper4 and native P4 switch.	baseline (configuration management);domain-specific language;forwarding plane;hypervisor;interrupt	Cheng Zhang;Jun Bi;Yu Zhou;Abdul Basit Dogar;Jianping Wu	2017		10.1145/3050220.3060600	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system	Networks	-14.735600316376734	82.14334936642	197305

As it separates the network functions from dedicated hardware devices to host services, many challenges arise. The flexibility of such technologies will enable the IT professionals to respond in a more agile fashion to the constantly demanding verticals and network service requirements.

The work presented in this article is the output of a co-lab established between BT and Intel Labs Europe to investigate network-function-virtualization-related problems faced by traditional telecom operators. Results from comprehensive testing of virtual CDN and WAN acceleration use cases are presented. These results led to the development of a number of insights that will help network operators optimize the deployment of NFV on standard high volume servers. Significantly, it was found that the default configuration for some use cases resulted in suboptimal resource allocation and consumption. Consequently, opportunities exist for carriers to fine-tune their NFV deployments from both the technical and economic perspectives using approaches such as embedded instrumentation.	carrier grade;content delivery network;embedded instrumentation;embedded system;hardware acceleration;mathematical optimization;network function virtualization;software deployment;transfer function	Paul Veitch;Michael J.

We provide a brief classification of technologies that cannot be ignored in the design process of 5G systems and illustrate how a new technological added value can be created, when current methodologies, design paradigms, as well as design patterns and their extensions are properly exploited in efficient Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures. We believe that in many cases, the required technology is already there; nevertheless the correct approach has to be worked out and placed within an appropriate context, especially in the case of the integration of complex RAN systems. The enhancements in RF optimization, the progress in cloud computing, Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), new design concepts such as Network Slicing have to become part of the RAN design methodology. Diverse architectural concepts should break existing stereotypes to pave the way towards the true 5G system integration.	cloud computing;coherent;compaq lte;control plane;distributed memory;forwarding plane;mathematical optimization;network function virtualization;radio access network;radio frequency;software design pattern;software-defined networking;system integration	Kostas Katsalis;Navid Nikaein;Eryk Schiller;Romain Favraud;Torsten Braun	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2016.7503760	real-time computing;cloud computing;architectural pattern;computer science;operating system;service-oriented architecture;distributed computing;ran;computer network	EDA	-15.293488750527693	85.69624206460412	198509
cbec563119b728c8f1d8d1c236f54c240f312ecd	design and demonstration of sdn-based flexible flow converging with protocol-oblivious forwarding (pof)		With the development of software-defined networking (SDN), people start to realize that the protocol-dependent nature of OpenFlow, i.e., the matching fields are defined according to existing network protocols (e.g., Ethernet and IP), will limit the programmability of forwarding plane and cause scalability issues. In this work, we focus on Protocol-Oblivious Forwarding (POF) [1], which can make the forwarding plane reconfigurable, programmable and future-proof with a protocol-independent instruction set. We design and implement a POF-based flexible flow converging (F-FC) scheme to reduce the number of flow-entries for enhanced scalability. To evaluate the POF system experimentally, we build a network testbed that consists of both commercial and software-based POF switches. Network experiments with real-time video streaming in the proposed POF system demonstrate that our POF-based F-FC approach can outperform conventional schemes.	algorithm;communications protocol;experiment;forwarding plane;network switch;openflow;real-time clock;reliability engineering;scalability;software-defined networking;streaming media;testbed	Daoyun Hu;Shengru Li;Nana Xue;Cen Chen;Shoujiang Ma;Wenjian Fang;Zuqing Zhu	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417001	communications protocol;real-time computing;scalability;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;optical fiber;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-13.450017856727081	82.99771541508505	199860
