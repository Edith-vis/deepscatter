First, a working account of responsibility is presented, which identifies two classic Aristotelian conditions for responsibility and adds a relational one, and which makes a distinction between responsibility for (what one does) and responsibility to (others). Then, this account is applied to a phenomenological analysis of what happens when we use a self-driving car and participate in traffic. It is argued that selfdriving cars threaten the excercise and ascription of responsibility in several ways. These include the replacement of human agency by machine agency, but also the user’s changing epistemic relation to the environment and others, which can be described in terms of (dis)engagement. It is concluded that the discussion about the ethics of self-driving cars and related problems of responsibility should be restricted neither to general responsibilities related to the use of self-driving cars and its objective risks, nor to questions regarding the behavior, intelligence, autonomy, and ethical “thinking” of the car in response to the objective features of the traffic situations (e.g. various scenarios). Rather, it should also reflect on the shifting experience of the user: how the new technology reshapes the subjectivity of the user and on the morel consequences this has.	autonomous car;unintended consequences	Mark Coeckelbergh	2016	Applied Artificial Intelligence	10.1080/08839514.2016.1229759	gradual release of responsibility;computer science;social responsibility	AI	-13.5301654325634	2.2812990985491135	194535

Within this line of research, we propose a formal model for argumentation-based dialogues between agents, using assumption-based argumentation (ABA). Thus, the dialogues amount to conducting an argumentation process in ABA. The model is given in terms of ABA-specific utterances, debate trees and forests implicitly built during and drawn from dialogues, legal-move functions (amounting to protocols) and outcome functions. Moreover, we investigate the strategic behaviour of agents in dialogues, using strategy-move functions. We instantiate our dialogue model in a range of dialogue types studied in the literature, including information-seeking, inquiry, persuasion, conflict resolution, and discovery. Finally, we prove (1) a formal connection between dialogues and wellknown argumentation semantics, and (2) soundness and completeness results for our dialogue models and dialogue strategies used in different dialogue types.	aba problem;game semantics;mathematical model	Xiuyi Fan;Francesca Toni	2011		10.5591/978-1-57735-516-8/IJCAI11-044	natural language processing;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-16.573957856145817	3.654669602201565	195322

The crux of the argument is that Ramsification may ruin inductive systematization between theory and observation. The argument also has some implications concerning the issue of underdetermination.	inductive reasoning	Panu Raatikainen	2010	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-010-9861-9	philosophy;epistemology;inductive reasoning;structuralism;mathematics;realism;algorithm	NLP	-12.593672878161367	3.563010777861819	199397
