e9503b433dd4fd4761f93719d745eecc427eab3e	parallel multi-level genetic ensemble for numerical weather prediction enhancement	parameter estimation;hpc;numerical weather prediction;evolutionary computing	The need for reliable predictions in environmental modelling is well-known. Particularly, the predicted weather and meteorological information about the future atmospheric state is crucial and necessary for almost all other areas of environmental modelling. Additionally, right decisions to prevent damages and save lives could be taken depending on a reliable meteorological prediction process. Lack and uncertainty of input data and parameters constitute the main source of errors for most of these models. In recent years, evolutionary optimization methods have become popular to solve the input parameter problem of environmental models. We propose a new parallel meteorological prediction scheme that uses evolutionary optimization methods based on Multi-Chromosome Genetic Algorithm to enhance the quality of weather forecasts by focusing on the calibration of input parameters. This new scheme is parallelized and executed on a HPC environment in order to reduce the time needed to obtain the final prediction. The new approach is called Multi-Level Genetic Ensemble (M-Level G-Ensemble) and it has been tested using historical data of a wellknown weather catastrophe: Hurricane Katrina that occurred in 2005 in the Gulf of Mexico. Results obtained with our approach provide both significant improvements in weather prediction and a significant reduction in the execution time.	catastrophe theory;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;numerical method;numerical weather prediction;parallel computing;parameter (computer programming);run time (program lifecycle phase);weather research and forecasting model	Hisham Ihshaish;Ana Carolina Castro Côrtes;Miquel A.

Faults are directly incorporated into the model. In this paper, we propose the concept of model structure (MS), which can be used for building fuzzy and neural models for fault detection. Algorithms for finding all MSs and methods for determining faults-symptoms relation are developed. This method is applicable to the design of model-based diagnostic systems, when only basic knowledge of the process to be diagnosed is available. No mathematical model is needed. This paper shows that GP can be constructed on the basis of process diagrams and expert knowledge. Models for fault detection can be built automatically from process measurements. Ideas are explained on a three-tank system example. In the last section, our proposed method is compared in detail with other existing approaches using qualitative models.	causal graph;cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher;diagram;fault detection and isolation;induced subgraph;mathematical model;structural analysis;vertex (graph theory)	Anna Sztyber;Andrzej Ostasz;Jan Maciej Kóscielny	2015	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2014.2384000	temperature measurement;computer science;artificial intelligence;graph theory;theoretical computer science;process flow diagram;machine learning;mathematical model;mathematics;redundancy;computational model;artificial neural network;fault detection and isolation	Robotics	13.222606408609142	-13.571110228821372	199103
