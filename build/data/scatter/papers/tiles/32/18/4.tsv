We assessed that proposal using measures of perceived mental workload (NASA-TLX) and stress (Dundee Stress State Questionnaire). Two types of vigilance task were employed: a traditional version, wherein observers made button-press responses to signify detection of rarely occurring critical signals, and a modified version, developed by Robertson et al. to promote mindlessness via routinization, wherein button-press responses acknowledged frequently occurring neutral stimulus events and response withholding signified critical signal detection. The vigilance decrement was observed in both tasks, and both tasks generated equally elevated levels of workload and stress, the latter including cognitions relating to performance adequacy. Vigilance performance seems better characterized by effortful attention (mindfulness) than by mindlessness. Actual or potential applications of this research include procedures to reduce the information-processing demand imposed by vigilance tasks and the stress associated with such tasks."""	cognition;detection theory;increment and decrement operators;mental concentration;united states national aeronautics and space administration	Rebecca A.

2a0ccc45add7e1cdd8f1ff40740d6dcadee97e90	evaluating the roles of the inferior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule in deductive reasoning: an rtms study	brodmann area;inferior frontal gyrus;belief bias effect;repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation;superior parietal lobule;deductive reasoning;repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms	This study used off-line repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to examine the roles of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in a deductive reasoning task. Subjects performed a categorical syllogistic reasoning task involving congruent, incongruent, and abstract trials. Twenty four subjects received magnetic stimulation to the SPL region prior to the task. In the other 24 subjects, TMS was administered to the IFG region before the task. Stimulation lasted for 10min, with an inter-pulse frequency of 1Hz. We found that bilateral SPL (Brodmann area (BA) 7) stimulation disrupted performance on abstract and incongruent reasoning. Left IFG (BA 45) stimulation impaired congruent reasoning performance while paradoxically facilitating incongruent reasoning performance. This resulted in the elimination of the belief-bias. In contrast, right IFG stimulation only impaired incongruent reasoning performance, thus enhancing the belief-bias effect. These findings are largely consistent with the dual-process theory of reasoning, which proposes the existence of two different human reasoning systems: a belief-based heuristic system; and a logic-based analytic system. The present findings suggest that the left language-related IFG (BA 45) may correspond to the heuristic system, while bilateral SPL may underlie the analytic system. The right IFG may play a role in blocking the belief-based heuristic system for solving incongruent reasoning trials. This study could offer an insight about functional roles of distributed brain systems in human deductive reasoning by utilizing the rTMS approach.	bachelor of arts;bilateral filter;blocking (computing);brodmann area;business architecture;case-based reasoning;dual;escuela superior latinoamericana de informática;excretory function;frontal lobe gyrus;heuristic;ifng gene;ifng wt allele;inferior frontal gyrus;online and offline;reasoning - publishing subsection;structure of superior parietal lobule;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Takeo Tsujii;Kaoru Sakatani;Sayako Masuda;Takekazu Akiyama;Shigeru Watanabe	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.076	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;deductive reasoning;social psychology	AI	17.259735836967526	-77.65863651362638	177583
c52fe83dd17b0a600d76cde33c628bc915f25a4b	encoding and accessing linguistic representations in a dynamically structured holographic memory system	act r;language processing;negative polarity;holographic reduced representations;binding;memory	This paper presents a computational model that integrates a dynamically structured holographic memory system into the ACT-R cognitive architecture to explain how linguistic representations are encoded and accessed in memory. ACT-R currently serves as the most precise expression of the moment-by-moment working memory retrievals that support sentence comprehension. The ACT-R model of sentence comprehension is able to capture a range of linguistic phenomena, but there are cases where the model makes the wrong predictions, such as the over-prediction of retrieval interference effects during sentence comprehension. Here, we investigate one such case involving the processing of sentences with negative polarity items (NPIs) and consider how a dynamically structured holographic memory system might provide a cognitively plausible and principled explanation of some previously unexplained effects. Specifically, we show that by replacing ACT-R's declarative memory with a dynamically structured memory, we can explain a wider range of behavioral data involving reading times and judgments of grammaticality. We show that our integrated model provides a better fit to human error rates and response latencies than the original ACT-R model. These results provide proof-of-concept for the unification of two independent computational cognitive frameworks.	act-r;cognitive architecture;computational model;encode;holographic data storage;holography;human error;interference (communication);judgment;linguistics;memory disorders;unification (computer science);polarity;sentence	Dan Parker;Daniel Lantz	2017	Topics in cognitive science	10.1111/tops.12246	psychology;natural language processing;neuroscience;computer science;theoretical computer science;memory;communication;cognitive science	NLP	14.576028158906007	-74.78624100890171	178110

Neuropharmacological evidence acquired in laboratory animals suggests that striatal dopaminergic mechanisms may be important for processing of this form of learning. However, because experiments conducted on dopamine deficient patients have reported contradictory evidence, the role of dopamine and the striatum remains unclear in human sequential learning. We used a newly developed dynamic molecular imaging technique to determine whether striatal dopamine is released during performance of a sequential learning task. In this study we localized striatal regions where dopamine receptor ligand (11C-raclopride) was displaced from receptor sites, during performance of a motor sequence learning (serial reaction time) task. The results suggest that the task induces release of endogenous dopamine in the posterior two-third of dorsomedial aspect of left putamen and the anterior part of the body of caudate bilaterally. The activations of the left putamen and the right caudate coincided with the activations observed earlier during performance of a motor planning task. Since these activations are associated with the selection and execution of a response, the activation in the left caudate, which was not observed in motor planning, is probably associated with the detection of a change in the 'context', and in the formulation of a new 'rule'. Thus, the results suggest that sequential learning involves two striatal dopaminergic mechanisms, one for the detection of a change in context, and the other for selection and execution of the response.	animals, laboratory;cognition;dopamine hydrochloride;dopamine receptor;experiment;ligands;mental processes;molecular imaging;neostriatum;patients;raclopride;structure of putamen	Rajendra D.

While it is generally accepted that alcohol impairs top-down cognitive control and conflict monitoring, it has remained unclear whether this also applies to subliminally triggered conflicts, as alcohol may not impair automated processes to the same extent. To investigate this, we used a within-subjects design in a sample of n = 22 healthy young male subjects who performed a complex response conflict paradigm while an EEG was recorded. Behavioral data showed that a binge-like intoxication of 1.1‰ increased the response conflict induced by consciously perceived flankers, but paradoxically decreased the response conflict induced by subliminal primes. The latter was found to be reflected in decreased amplitude differences in the visual N1, which reflects attentional aspects of stimulus processing, and the N2 as well as a following central negativity, which are thought to reflect conflict monitoring and cognitive effort. On the neuroanatomical level, we found the decrease in subliminally induced response conflicts to be based on changes in fronto-parietal networks (including BA 7/the precuneus, BA 40/the postcentral gyrus, BA 23 & 24/the cingulate cortex and BA 13/the insular cortex) that subserve attention allocation, the processing of complex stimuli and cognitive conflict. It can be concluded that alcohol intoxication paradoxically reduces subliminally triggered response conflicts, which may be caused by decreased allocation of attention towards less salient/noticeable stimuli.	alcoholic intoxication;allocation;appendix;binge drinking;binge eating disorder;blue (queue management algorithm);business architecture;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;complex response;conflict (psychology);consciousness;control theory;electroencephalography;ethanol;german research centre for artificial intelligence;negativity (quantum mechanics);preference learning;programming paradigm;sensitivity and specificity;structure of postcentral gyrus;structure of precuneus;top-down and bottom-up design	Ann-Kathrin Stock;Nicole Wolff;Christian Beste	2017	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.08.066	precuneus;visual n1;complex response;developmental psychology;psychology;cingulate cortex;cognitive psychology;insular cortex;conflict theories;subliminal stimuli;social psychology;binge drinking	HCI	16.277577509503185	-77.8609192895919	179625
4cdffec505a30f6281ee8f94b905d6eb901d9262	fractal structure of the nested actions of keeping the beat		The current experiments investigated the fractal structure in the nested actions of tapping behavior. The results revealed that task constraints (e.g., tapping to a metronome) alter the fractal structure of a given aspect of the behavior (e.g., intertap interval) and decouple its long-term interactions with other aspects of the behavior (e.g., key-press duration). These results support the idea that fractal structure reflects the dynamical organization of complex systems.	complex systems;dynamical system;experiment;fractal;interaction	Charles A.

Suls [A two-stage model for the appreciation of jokes and cartoons. In P. E. Goldstein & J. H. McGhee (Eds.), The psychology of humour. Theoretical perspectives and empirical issues. New York: Academic Press, 1972, pp. 81100] proposed a two-stage model of humor: detection and resolution of incongruity. Incongruity is generated when a prediction is not confirmed in the final part of a story. To comprehend humor, it is necessary to revisit the story, transforming an incongruous situation into a funny, congruous one. Patient and neuroimaging studies carried out until now lead to different outcomes. In particular, patient studies found that right brain-lesion patients have difficulties in humor comprehension, whereas neuroimaging studies suggested a major involvement of the left hemisphere in both humor detection and comprehension. To prevent activation of the left hemisphere due to language processing, we devised a nonverbal task comprising cartoon pairs. Our findings demonstrate activation of both the left and the right hemispheres when comparing funny versus nonfunny cartoons. In particular, we found activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47), the left superior temporal gyrus (BA 38), the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), and the left cerebellum. These areas were also activated in a nonverbal task exploring attribution of intention [Brunet, E., Sarfati, Y., Hardy-Bayle, M. C., & Decety, J. A PET investigation of the attribution of intentions with a nonverbal task. Neuroimage, 11, 157166, 2000]. We hypothesize that the resolution of incongruity might occur through a process of intention attribution. We also asked subjects to rate the funniness of each cartoon pair. A parametric analysis showed that the left amygdala was activated in relation to subjective amusement. We hypothesize that the amygdala plays a key role in giving humor an emotional dimension.	amygdaloid structure;brain neoplasms;business architecture;cartoons;cerebellum;frontal lobe gyrus;inferior frontal gyrus;intention - mental process;list comprehension;neuroimaging;patients;poncirus trifoliata;structure of middle temporal gyrus;superior temporal gyrus;attribution;fmri	Angela Bartolo;Francesca Benuzzi;Luca Nocetti;Patrizia Baraldi;Paolo Frigio Nichelli	2006	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2006.18.11.1789	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;topography;communication;comedy;cognitive science	AI	13.8573677562603	-77.23453144389637	181651

The sensitivity of muscle spindle is nonlinearly dependent on the activation of gamma (γ) motoneurons in the spinal cord that receives inputs from the motor cortex. How fusimotor control of spindle sensitivity affects proprioceptive coding of joint position is not clear. Furthermore, what information is carried in the fusimotor signal from the motor cortex to the muscle spindle is largely unknown. In this study, we addressed the issue of communication between the central and peripheral sensorimotor systems using a computational approach based on the virtual arm (VA) model. In simulation experiments within the operational range of joint movements, the gamma static commands (γ(s)) to the spindles of both mono-articular and bi-articular muscles were hypothesized (1) to remain constant, (2) to be modulated with joint angles linearly, and (3) to be modulated with joint angles nonlinearly. Simulation results revealed a nonlinear landscape of Ia afferent with respect to both γ(s) activation and joint angle. Among the three hypotheses, the constant and linear strategies did not yield Ia responses that matched the experimental data, and therefore, were rejected as plausible strategies of spindle sensitivity control. However, if γ(s) commands were quadratically modulated with joint angles, a robust linear relation between Ia afferents and joint angles could be obtained in both mono-articular and bi-articular muscles. With the quadratic strategy of spindle sensitivity control, γ(s) commands may serve as the CNS outputs that inform the periphery of central coding of joint angles. The results suggest that the information of joint angles may be communicated between the CNS and muscles via the descending γ(s) efferent and Ia afferent signals.	angularjs;cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;cns disorder;cerebral cortex;computation;computational neuroscience;encode;experiment;hard disk drive;modulation;movement;muscle spindles;neuroscience discipline;nonlinear system;parabolic antenna;peripheral;simulation;spinal cord;spindle;spindle apparatus	Ning Lan;Xin He	2012		10.3389/fncom.2012.00066	neuroscience;medical research;computer science;bioinformatics;communication;anatomy	Robotics	17.124906530423818	-73.93825389258888	181819

They serve as tools which improve the understanding of (patho-) physiological processes, may help to meet clinical decisions and can even enhance medical therapies. These models are typically implemented in a signal-flow-oriented simulation environment and focus on the behavior of one specific subsystem. Neglecting other physiological subsystems and using a technical description of the physiology hinders the exchange with and acceptance of clinicians. By contrast, this paper presents a new model implemented in a physical, object-oriented modeling environment which includes the cardiovascular, respiratory and thermoregulatory system. Simulation results for a healthy subject at rest and at the onset of exercise are given, showing the validity of the model. Finally, simulation results showing the interaction of the cardiovascular system with a ventricular assist device in case of heart failure are presented showing the flexibility and mightiness of the model and the simulation environment. Thus, we present a new model including three important physiological systems and one medical device implemented in an innovative simulation environment.	artificial ventricle;dymola;heart failure;mathematical model;mathematics;medical devices;onset (audio);simulation;skin physiological phenomena;physiological aspects	Stefanie Heinke;Carina B.

236248841b11845879e71c3454a024a79d33bc22	modelling the supervisory system and frontal dysfunction: an architecturally grounded model of the wisconsin card sorting task		We present a model of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a classical neuropsychological test frequently used to assess deficits in executive functioning. The model is grounded in a cognitive architecture based on the Supervisory System theory of Norman and Shallice (1986) and evaluated against data from control subjects and several groups of neurological patients as reported by Stuss et al. (2000). The model is able to account for control performance across a range of dependent measures. When damaged in theoretically motivated ways it is also able to capture the behaviour of the different patient groups. Specifically, the model supports the association by Shallice et al. (2008) of the function of tasksetting to left lateral prefrontal cortex, of the function of attentiveness to inferior medial prefrontal cortex, and of the function of monitoring to right lateral prefrontal cortex. The implication of these results for the supervisory system architecture and the localisation of function within prefrontal cortex are discussed.	card sorting;cognitive architecture;lateral thinking;medial graph;systems architecture	Mariam R Sood;Richard P.

83bcfa4c05e385cadb5d62da92ab966915fc3048	machine learning techniques for classification of livestock behavior		Animal activity recognition is in the interest of agricultural community, animal behaviorists, and conservationists since it acts as an indicator of the animal’s health in addition to their nutrition intake when the observation is performed during the circadian circle. Machine learning techniques and tools are used to help identify the activities of livestock. These techniques are helpful to discriminate between complex patterns for classifying animal behaviors during the day; human observation alone is labor intensive and time consuming. This research proposes a robust machine learning method to classify five activities of livestock. To prove the concept, a dataset was utilized based on the observation of two sheep and four goats. A feature selection technique, namely Boruta, was tested with multilayer perceptron, random forests, extreme gradient boosting, and k-Nearest neighbors algorithms. The best results were obtained with random forests achieving accuracy of 96.47% and kappa value of 95.41%. The results showed that the method can classify grazing, lying, scratching or biting, standing, and walking with high sensitivity and specificity.

3d97357ad352a8b04c6272182c47ad855d7b3460	does the emotional modulation of visual experience entail the cognitive penetrability or emotional penetrability of early vision?		I argue that emotive states affect perceptual processing either directly or indirectly with latencies that fall within late vision and not early vision. These effects differ from the effects of, and are subserved by different neuronal mechanisms than those that subserve, attentional effects on perception, although the two sorts of effects may interact. It follows that the emotive effects found in perception do not entail either the cognitive penetrability of early vision or its emotional penetrability.	cognitive science;modulation	Athanassios Raftopoulos	2014				HCI	14.883549857928413	-76.72591233527446	183491

In such situations, humans might explore actions more efficiently by searching only the most likely subspace of the whole action space. To study how the brain solves such action selection problems, we designed a Multi Feature Sorting Task in which the task rules defining an optimal action have a hierarchical structure and studied concurrent brain activity using it. The task consisted of two kinds of rule switches: a higher-order switch to search for a rule across different subspaces and a lower-order switch to change a rule within the same subspace. The results revealed that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was more active in the higher-order switching, and the right fronto-polar cortex (FPC) was significantly activated with the lower-order switching. We discuss a possible functional model in the prefrontal cortex where the left DLPFC encodes the hierarchical organization of behaviours and the right FPC maintains and updates multiple behavioural. This interpretation is highly consistent with the previous findings and current theories of hierarchical organization in the prefrontal functional network.	action selection;decision making;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;electroencephalography;function model;network switch;rule (guideline);sorting;switch device component;theory	Wako Yoshida;Hidefumi Funakoshi;Shin Ishii	2010	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.017	psychology;computer simulation;mental chronometry;neuroscience;higher-order logic;developmental psychology;radiology;action selection;function model;magnetic resonance imaging;probability;brain mapping;social psychology	ML	16.981951925861786	-76.70335627343431	184065

We investigated the influences of top-down control on the neural responses to multisensory stimulation using EEG recording and time-frequency analyses. Participants were stimulated at the index or thumb of the left hand, using tactile vibrators mounted on a foam cube. Simultaneously they received a visual distractor from a light emitting diode adjacent to the active vibrator (spatially congruent trial) or adjacent to the inactive vibrator (spatially incongruent trial). The task was to respond to the elevation of the tactile stimulus (upper or lower), while ignoring the simultaneous visual distractor. To manipulate top-down control on this multisensory stimulation, the proportion of spatially congruent (vs. incongruent) trials was changed across blocks. Our results reveal that the behavioral cost of responding to incongruent than congruent trials (i.e., the crossmodal congruency effect) was modulated by the proportion of congruent trials. Most importantly, the EEG gamma band response and the gamma-theta coupling were also affected by this modulation of top-down control, whereas the late theta band response related to the congruency effect was not. These findings suggest that gamma band response is more than a marker of multisensory binding, being also sensitive to the correspondence between expected and actual multisensory stimulation. By contrast, theta band response was affected by congruency but appears to be largely immune to stimulation expectancy.	bottom-up proteomics;cube dosage form;default;electroencephalography;frequency band;gamma correction;greater than;light emitting diode device component;lindane;modulation;needham–schroeder protocol;phase congruency;physical inactivity;top-down and bottom-up design;vibrator (electronic);vibrator device component	Noriaki Kanayama;Luigi Tamè;Hideki Ohira;Francesco Pavani	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.11.076	psychology;vision;computer vision;time–frequency analysis;communication;social psychology	ML	16.34012772254594	-77.24076466044305	185284

A companion article in this issue (Evaluating Auditory Performance Limits: I) describes an extension of the SDT approach to allow the use of computational models that provide more accurate descriptions of neural responses. This article describes an extension to more complex psychophysical tasks. A general method is presented for evaluating psychophysical performance limits for discrimination tasks in which one stimulus parameter is randomly varied. Psychophysical experiments often randomly vary a single parameter in order to restrict the cues that are available to the subject. The method is demonstrated for the auditory task of random-level frequency discrimination using a computational auditory nerve (AN) model. Performance limits based on AN discharge times (all-information) are compared to performance limits based only on discharge counts (rate place). Both decision models are successful in predicting that random-level variation has no effect on performance in quiet, which is the typical result in psychophysical tasks with random-level variation. The distribution of information across the AN population provides insight into how different types of AN information can be used to avoid the influence of random-level variation. The rate-place model relies on comparisons between fibers above and below the tone frequency (i.e., the population response), while the all-information model does not require such across-fiber comparisons. Frequency discrimination with random-level variation in the presence of high-frequency noise is also simulated. No effect is predicted for all-information, consistent with the small effect in human performance; however, a large effect is predicted for rate-place in noise with random-level variation.	auditory processing disorder;cochlear nerve;computation;computational model;detection theory;discharger;experiment;human reliability;information model;neural coding;population parameter;randomness;service description table;syntax-directed translation;tissue fiber	Michael G.

8fa71d11b4bfe963a2c1698e35ecc4fc5cc7a265	the differential contributions of pfc and temporo-parietal cortex to multimodal semantic control: exploring refractory effects in semantic aphasia	parietal cortex;control network;semantic processing;semantic relations;semantic retrieval;inferior frontal cortex	Aphasic patients with multimodal semantic impairment following pFC or temporo-parietal (TP) cortex damage (semantic aphasia [SA]) have deficits characterized by poor control of semantic activation/retrieval, as opposed to loss of semantic knowledge per se. In line with this, SA patients show “refractory effects”; that is, declining accuracy in cyclical word–picture matching tasks when semantically related sets are presented rapidly and repeatedly. This is argued to follow a build-up of competition between targets and distractors. However, the link between poor semantic control and refractory effects is still controversial for two reasons. (1) Some theories propose that refractory effects are specific to verbal or auditory tasks, yet SA patients show poor control over semantic processing in both word and picture semantic tasks. (2) SA can result from lesions to either the left pFC or TP cortex, yet previous work suggests that refractory effects are specifically linked to the left inferior frontal cortex. For the first time, verbal, visual, and nonverbal auditory refractory effects were explored in nine SA patients who had pFC (pFC+) or TP cortex (TP-only) lesions. In all modalities, patient accuracy declined significantly over repetitions. This refractory effect at the group level was driven by pFC+ patients and was not shown by individuals with TP-only lesions. These findings support the theory that SA patients have reduced control over multimodal semantic retrieval and, additionally, suggest there may be functional specialization within the posterior versus pFC elements of the semantic control network.	broca aphasia;cfp wt allele;cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;microsoft word for mac;multimodal interaction;parietal lobe;partial template specialization;patients;perseveration;theory;aphasic;frontal lobe	Hannah E.

Three variables are particularly important when making a decision: the potential payoff, the probability of success, and the cost in terms of time and effort. A key brain region in decision making is the frontal cortex as damage here impairs the ability to make optimal choices across a range of decision types. We simultaneously recorded the activity of multiple single neurons in the frontal cortex while subjects made choices involving the three aforementioned decision variables. This enabled us to contrast the relative contribution of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the orbito-frontal cortex, and the lateral prefrontal cortex to the decision-making process. Neurons in all three areas encoded value relating to choices involving probability, payoff, or cost manipulations. However, the most significant signals were in the ACC, where neurons encoded multiplexed representations of the three different decision variables. This supports the notion that the ACC is an important component of the neural circuitry underlying optimal decision making.	acoustic lobing;anatomical position;artificial neural network;behavioral sciences;choice behavior;cingulate cortex;decision making;decision theory;electronic circuit;encode (action);epilepsy, temporal lobe;lateral thinking;modality (human–computer interaction);motor cortex;multiplexing;neuron;orofacial cleft 1;prefrontal cortex;temporal logic;frontal lobe	Steven W.

The emotional expression (happy, sad) and neutral expression were used as interdependent or search targets in this paradigm. Subjects were asked to search the target face form a matrix containing 16 emotional faces after watching the target face. The measurement indices of the search process — scanpath duration (SPD), scanpath length (SPL), convex hull area (CHA)—were collected and analyzed. The three indexes of patients were all larger than those in control group and there were significant differences between the groups. It can be seen that two kinds of emotional faces reduce the search efficiency of depression patients and there is a slow response and mental retardation phenomenon for depression in the search process.	convex hull;interdependence;parsing expression grammar;programming paradigm	Xingwang Liu;Mi Li;Shengfu Lu;Ming Zhang;Dachao Liu;Lei Feng;Bingbing Fu;Gang Wang;Ning Zhong	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217788	cognitive psychology;visual search;artificial intelligence;computer science;convex hull;machine learning;eye movement;emotional expression;phenomenon	Visualization	14.587891993057928	-78.18096461048164	188258

Recently, we showed that this brain region is active in reinforcement learning, during which subjects constantly have to integrate trial outcomes in order to optimize performance. To further elucidate the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in reinforcement learning, we applied continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) either to the left or right DLPFC, or to the vertex as a control region, respectively, prior to the performance of a probabilistic learning task in an fMRI environment. While there was no influence of cTBS on learning performance per se, we observed a stimulation-dependent modulation of reward vs. punishment sensitivity: Left-hemispherical DLPFC stimulation led to a more reward-guided performance, while right-hemispherical cTBS induced a more avoidance-guided behavior. FMRI results showed enhanced prediction error coding in the ventral striatum in subjects stimulated over the left as compared to the right DLPFC. Both behavioral and imaging results are in line with recent findings that left, but not right-hemispherical stimulation can trigger a release of dopamine in the ventral striatum, which has been suggested to increase the relative impact of rewards rather than punishment on behavior.	cognition disorders;dopamine;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;error detection and correction;error message;inductive bias;lateral thinking;modulation;neostriatum;processor control region;rem sleep behavior disorder;reinforcement learning;rewards;transcranial magnetic stimulation;ventral striatum;vertex;fmri	Derek V.

A critical question is whether the Ne observed on errors and the negativity reported on correct trials reflect the same (modulated) activity, or whether they reflect completely different mechanisms. These two alternative possibilities were tested thanks to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and source localization. ICA results showed that the waves recorded on errors and correct trials can be accounted for by the same independent component, corresponding to a dipolar source located within the Rostral Cingulate Zone. Source localization on the raw data also confirmed a common generator for correct and error trials. These data suggest that the waves on errors and correct trials reflect the same brain activity, whose amplitude varies as a function of the correctness of the response.

We employed behavioral and ERP measures to study whether the attentive processing of spoken messages is, in itself, sufficient to produce visual–attentional deficits. Participants searched for visual targets defined by a unique feature (Experiment 1) or feature conjunction (Experiment 2), and simultaneously listened to narrated text passages that had to be recalled later (encoding condition), or heard backward-played speech sounds that could be ignored (control condition). Responses to targets were slower in the encoding condition, and ERPs revealed that the visual processing of search arrays and the attentional selection of target stimuli were less efficient in the encoding relative to the control condition. Results demonstrate that the attentional processing of visual information is impaired when concurrent spoken messages are encoded and maintained, in line with cross-modal links in selective attention, but inconsistent with the view that attentional resources are modality-specific. The distraction of visual attention by active listening could contribute to the adverse effects of cell phone use on driving performance.	area striata structure;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;auditory perception;cellular phone;erp;experiment;mobile phone;modal logic;modality (human–computer interaction);search - action;selectivity (electronic);sound - physical agent;message	Elena Gherri;Martin Eimer	2011	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2010.21468	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;attention;visual search;communication;n2pc	HCI	15.643316568282689	-77.19333574328799	189260

Most oculomotor structures, such as the superior colliculus or the FEFs, play an additional role in visuospatial attention. Indeed, electrical stimulation of these structures can cause changes in visual sensitivity that are location specific. We have proposed that the recently discovered ocular proprioceptive area in the human postcentral gyrus (S1EYE) may have a similar function. This suggestion was based on the observation that a reduction of excitability in this area with TMS causes not only a shift in perceived eye position but also lateralized changes in visual sensitivity. Here we investigated whether these shifts in perceived gaze position and visual sensitivity are spatially congruent. After continuous theta burst stimulation over S1EYE, participants underestimated own eye rotation, so that saccades from a lateral eye rotation undershoot a central sound (Experiment 1). They discriminated letters faster if they were presented nearer the orbit midline (Experiment 2) and spent less time looking at locations nearer the orbit midline when searching for a nonexistent target in a letter array (Experiment 3). This suggests that visual sensitivity increased nearer the orbit midline, in the same direction as the shift in perceived eye position. This spatial congruence argues for a functional coupling between the cortical eye position signal in the somatosensory cortex and visuospatial attention.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;coil device component;connected_to relation;corpora quadrigemina, superior colliculus;electric stimulation technique;excited state;functional electrical stimulation;interdependence;loic;lateral thinking;neural ensemble;paraneoplastic syndromes, ocular;saccades;somatosensory cortex;spatial–temporal reasoning;structure of postcentral gyrus;transcranial magnetic stimulation;zeller's congruence	Bartholomäus Odoj;Daniela Balslev	2013	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00382	psychology;developmental psychology;visual search;communication	HCI	16.338084518451446	-77.4846862583726	189454

Because the VEP is typically much smaller in magnitude than the ongoing spontaneous EEG signal, the VEP is derived by averaging a large number of responses time-locked to stimulus presentation. Standard theory has it that the VEP is independent of the ongoing EEG, however, there has long been a competing view that the VEP is caused by a partial phase reset of the spontaneous alpha rhythm. We calculated the VEP where stimuli were presented at four different phases of the ongoing alpha rhythm, and subtracted away the responses to null trials synchronized to the same alpha rhythm phases, creating estimates of the VEP as a function of ongoing alpha rhythm phase. For some subjects there was evidence of an interaction between the VEP and the phase of the ongoing alpha rhythm, but this was idiosyncratic between subjects and conditions, and mostly evident in a later period when the VEP magnitude was very small. However, in general the VEP is independent of the phase of the ongoing alpha rhythm, and hence cannot be primarily caused by a partial phase resetting of the spontaneous EEG. It is possible that the VEP is either a phase-reset of an ongoing oscillation, or an oscillation induced by the sudden onset of a stimulus, but it cannot be the same oscillation as the surface alpha.	alpha rhythm;area striata structure;cerebral cortex;choose (action);electroencephalography;estimated;onset (audio);small;spontaneous order;surface electrode;visual evoked cortical potential	Michael L Risner;Christopher J.

We investigated whether multiple-color attentional guidance is possible when target colors remain constant and can thus be represented in long-term memory but not when they change frequently and have to be held in working memory. Participants searched for one, two, or three possible target colors that were specified by cue displays at the start of each trial. In constant-color blocks, the same colors remained task-relevant throughout. In variable-color blocks, target colors changed between trials. The contralateral delay activity (CDA) to cue displays increased in amplitude as a function of color memory load in variable-color blocks, which indicates that cued target colors were held in working memory. In constant-color blocks, the CDA was much smaller, suggesting that color representations were primarily stored in long-term memory. N2pc components to targets were measured as a marker of attentional target selection. Target N2pcs were attenuated and delayed during multiple-color search, demonstrating less efficient attentional deployment to color-defined target objects relative to single-color search. Importantly, these costs were the same in constant-color and variable-color blocks. These results demonstrate that attentional guidance by multiple-feature as compared with single-feature templates is less efficient both when target features remain constant and can be represented in long-term memory and when they change across trials and therefore have to be maintained in working memory.	.cda file;clinical use template;color;deploy;memory disorders;memory, long-term;small	Anna Grubert;Nancy B.

In this study, we investigated the neural correlates of the correction of subliminal and supraliminal phase shifts during a sensorimotor synchronization task. In particular, we focused on the role of the cerebellum because this structure has been shown to play a role in both motor timing and error correction. Experiment 1 used fMRI to show that the right cerebellar dentate nucleus and primary motor and sensory cortices were activated during regular timing and during the correction of subliminal errors. The correction of supraliminal phase shifts led to additional activations in the left cerebellum and right inferior parietal and frontal areas. Furthermore, a psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that supraliminal error correction was associated with enhanced connectivity of the left cerebellum with frontal, auditory, and sensory cortices and with the right cerebellum. Experiment 2 showed that suppression of the left but not the right cerebellum with theta burst TMS significantly affected supraliminal error correction. These findings provide evidence that the left lateral cerebellum is essential for supraliminal error correction during sensorimotor synchronization.	artificial neural network;cell nucleus;cerebellar cortex structure;cognition disorders;consciousness;correction of hearing impairment;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;dentate nucleus;experiment;functional imaging;inborn errors of metabolism;lateral thinking;medial graph;negative feedback;neural network simulation;neuroscience discipline;physical object;pixel density;respiratory burst;sensorimotor cortex;swift (programming language);theta model;zero suppression;error correction;fmri;frontal lobe	Janine Diane Bijsterbosch;Kwang-Hyuk Lee;Michael D.

Several studies have reported impairment of central nervous processes during weightlessness. There is ongoing debate as to whether these impairments are attributable to primary physiological effects or secondary psychological effects of the weightlessness environment. This study evaluates the physiological effects of changed gravity conditions on brain cortical activity. In a first experiment, EEG activity of seven participants was recorded at normal, increased and zero gravity during a parabolic flight. Additionally an EEG under normal gravity conditions preflight was recorded. In a second experiment, 24 participants were exposed to a supine, seated and 9 degree head-down tilt position while EEG was recorded. Data were analysed using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Beta-2 EEG activity (18-35 Hz) was found to be increased in the right superior frontal gyrus under normal gravity conditions inflight. By exposure to weightlessness a distinct inhibition of this activity within the same areas could be noticed. As the tilt experiment showed changes in the left inferior temporal gyrus in supine and tilted positions we conclude that the observed changes under weightlessness are not explainable by hemodynamic changes but rather reflect emotional processes related to the experience of weightlessness. These findings suggest that weightlessness has a major impact on electro cortical activity and may affect central nervous and adaptation processes.	acclimatization;arabic numeral 0;electroencephalography;frontal lobe gyrus;hemodynamics;hertz (hz);image resolution;injury due to weightlessness;parabolic antenna;state of zero gravity;structure of inferior temporal gyrus;tomography	Stefan Schneider;Vera Brümmer;Heather Carnahan;Adam Dubrowski;Christopher D.

One view posits that similarity-based induction, utilizing perceptual features, may allow for increased encoding and higher memory accuracy on recognition tests. While category-based induction, utilizing semantic information, may result in limiting encoding of perceptual detail, thus resulting in decreased memory accuracy. In Experiment 1, we attempted to impair spontaneous categorization by presenting a second Working Memory load task. In Experiment 2, we attempted to impair perceptual processing by introducing a second Visual Search task. Results indicate that adult participants can rely on either mechanism when performing induction.	categorization;experiment;inductive reasoning;mathematical induction;spontaneous order	Tracey Miser;Vladimir M.

Excessive load on working memory hinders learning or performance of individuals. Lexile measure is the current tool used in assessing the difficulty levels of text reading in English language. Studies on correlating the cognitive load with EEG for classifying tasks based on Lexile measures have been performed for native English speakers. In this work, an attempt has been made to analyze the scope of Lexile measure for assessing the cognitive load of normal subjects. The protocol included reading and recall of texts with different Lexile complexities followed by resting phases. For increasing Lexile level complexities, a considerable increase in cognitive processing was noticed during task phase. Further, an increase in beta power was noticed at the central region indicating active information processing and decision making. Relative theta power (R?=0.11) was significant (p=0.022) in low Lexile level material and gradually decreased as the difficulty level of the tasks increased. Relative theta power was found to be decreasing as the complexity level of the text material increased and was found to dominate in both mid frontal and mid parietal regions during the recall phase. During test phase an increase in alpha power was observed at parietal region reflecting active information processing. This was evident from the highly significant (p=0.022), relative alpha power (Ra =0.036) for recall of high complexity Lexile material compared to medium (Ra=0.005) and low (Ra=0.005) level materials. Thus, it is seen that this study could be more effective in analyzing the cognitive load of subjects with different working memory efficiency. Also, while performing analysis on instructional material design based on cognitive load of different subjects, such procedures seem to be more significant.

The emotional ratings were clearly affected by the pleasantness of the animal displayed on the screen. The modulation of the tactile stimulation itself (short or long) was affected by how many times an animal appears on the screen. Our study suggests that fewer images resulted in higher emotional ratings affecting, therefore, shorter and longer durations differently based on the nature of the visual stimulus. This study is the first step in a long investigation to understand the visual-tactile emotional association for better implementation in the future.

4732d4b8685e57a1618bdf51e6b2fed64d1ee3e0	brain dynamics in the comprehension of action-related language. a time-frequency analysis of mu rhythms		"""EEG mu rhythms (8-13 Hz) recorded at fronto-central electrodes are generally considered as markers of motor cortical activity in humans, because they are modulated when participants perform an action, when they observe another's action or even when they imagine performing an action. In this study, we analyzed the time-frequency (TF) modulation of mu rhythms while participants read action language (""""You will cut the strawberry cake""""), abstract language (""""You will doubt the patient's argument""""), and perceptive language (""""You will notice the bright day""""). The results indicated that mu suppression at fronto-central sites is associated with action language rather than with abstract or perceptive language. Also, the largest difference between conditions occurred quite late in the sentence, while reading the first noun, (contrast Action vs. Abstract), or the second noun following the action verb (contrast Action vs. Perceptive). This suggests that motor activation is associated with the integration of words across the sentence beyond the lexical processing of the action verb. Source reconstruction localized mu suppression associated with action sentences in premotor cortex (BA 6). The present study suggests (1) that the understanding of action language activates motor networks in the human brain, and (2) that this activation occurs online based on semantic integration across multiple words in the sentence."""	action language;business architecture;electroencephalography;frequency analysis;hertz (hz);largest;modulation;patients;semantic integration;time–frequency analysis;zero suppression;electrode;mu-chain disease;sentence	Iván Moreno;Manuel de Vega;Inmaculada León;Marcel C.

This signal is also hypothesized to be used to modify behavior to ascertain that future events will have better outcomes. It is therefore expected that this signal be correlated with learning outcomes. We report a study designed to examine the extent to which the ERN is related to learning outcomes within a paired-associates learning task. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by stimuli that indicated to the participants whether their response was correct or not was examined both according the degree to which the associates were learned in the session and according to whether participants recalled the associations on the next day. The results of the spatio-temporal PCA indicate that, whereas the process giving rise to the negative feedback elicited a FRN whose amplitude was not correlated with long-term learning outcomes, positive feedback was associated with a FRN-like activity, which was correlated with the learning outcomes. Another ERP component that follows the FRN temporally and shares its spatial distribution was found associated with long-term learning outcomes. Our findings shed light on the functional significance of the feedback-related ERP components and are discussed within the framework of the reinforcement learning ERN hypothesis.	age related macular degeneration;dopamine;erp;mental association;midbrain structure;negative feedback;negativity (quantum mechanics);positive feedback;reinforcement learning;temporal logic	Yael Arbel;Kristen Goforth;Emanuel Donchin	2013	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00385	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	ML	15.222211436674053	-77.75400183952085	195429
b15b97d81e7790c8639b2297e6f8429c4f14858f	development of executive control and language processing	executive control;language processing	Research in executive function development has shown that children have poor control of inhibition functions, including the inhibition of prepotent responses, control of attention, and flexibility at rule-shifting. To date, links between the development of executive function and children’s language development have not been investigated explicitly. Yet, recent studies on children’s sentence processing report that children tend to perseverate during sentence processing. We argue that such perseveration may be due to immature executive function.

Speech Imagery concept will be useful for patients with neurological disorders for decoding their thoughts and possibly convert their thought to speech through some external medium. In this paper Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were acquired from two healthy subjects while speaking and imagining of speaking five consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words in multiple trials of different time frames. Each trial was carried out for five times during both the tasks. The acquired EEG signals wereanalyzed in frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform and the power spectral densities for each band were derived. Based on the derived absolute power, relative spectral powers were computed for each EEG frequency band during speaking and imagining of speaking. Relative powers for both inter and intra hemispheric frontal and temporal electrodes were analyzed as these electrodes are located near Broca's and Wernicke's area. From theresults it was inferred that relative power of theta band was found to be high while imagining of speaking a CVC word and similarly relative power of alpha band was found to be dominant while speaking a CVC word. It has also been observed that averaged relative power of left hemispheric frontal and temporal electrodes was increasing progressively as the resting time for the task is increased. Comparatively the averaged relative power was found to be higher than the relative power of a single trial. This work will be clinically useful for speech impaired people as it is feasible to recognize the word from these signal processing methods.	biconnected component;electroencephalography;fast fourier transform;frequency band;signal processing;vowel–consonant synthesis	C.

Only the repetition of reward episodes helps distinguish true cause–effect relationships from coincidental occurrences. In the model proposed here, a novel plasticity rule employs short- and long-term changes to evaluate hypotheses on cause–effect relationships. Transient weights represent hypotheses that are consolidated in long-term memory only when they consistently predict or cause future rewards. The main objective of the model is to preserve existing network topologies when learning with ambiguous information flows. Learning is also improved by biasing the exploration of the stimulus–response space toward actions that in the past occurred before rewards. The model indicates under which conditions beliefs can be consolidated in long-term memory, it suggests a solution to the plasticity–stability dilemma, and proposes an interpretation of the role of short-term plasticity.	acclimatization;action potential;alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;artificial neural network;asynchrony (computer programming);biasing;biological neural networks;coat of arms;deterministic algorithm;emoticon;equivalent weight;feedback;flow;hebbian theory;heuristic;heuristics;icub;leaky bucket;memory, long-term;network topology;neuron;neurons;quantity;reinforcement learning;rewards;robot (device);sampling (signal processing);sensor;synapses	Andrea Soltoggio	2014	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-014-0628-0	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;memory consolidation;artificial intelligence;machine learning;operant conditioning;social psychology	ML	15.678317239447983	-74.22529199733813	197326

We used psychophysical methods to determine individual behavioural thresholds in a point-light direction discrimination paradigm for a small but carefully matched groups of adults (N=10 per group) with and without ASDs. These thresholds were used to derive individual stimulus levels in an identical fMRI task, with the purpose of equalising task performance across all participants whilst inside the scanner. The results of this investigation show that despite comparable behavioural performance both inside and outside the scanner, the group with ASDs shows a different pattern of BOLD activation from the TD group in response to the same stimulus levels. Furthermore, connectivity analysis suggests that the main differences between the groups are that the TD group utilise a unitary network with information passing from temporal to parietal regions, whilst the ASD group utilise two distinct networks; one utilising motion sensitive areas and another utilising form selective areas. Furthermore, a temporal-parietal link that is present in the TD group is missing in the ASD group. We tentatively propose that these differences may occur due to early dysfunctional connectivity in the brains of people with ASDs, which to some extent is compensated for by rewiring in high functioning adults.	acoustic lobing;atrial septal defects;autism spectrum disorders;autistic disorder;brain;congenital abnormality;denial-of-service attack;dyskinesia, drug-induced;epilepsy, temporal lobe;kinesiology;leukoencephalopathies;parietal lobe;programming paradigm;scanning systems;while;white matter;fmri	Lawrie S.
