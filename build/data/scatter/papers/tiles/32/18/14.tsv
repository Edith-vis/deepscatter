In the BCFC Supporters Travel Survey undertaken in 2008, 57% of those surveyed indicated they were car drivers (plus 5% dropped off and 1% taxi – total 63%) and 18% passengers. When calculating the figure for extra cars generated by the new Stadium, WSP use the figures of 32% of fans will be car drivers(plus 2.75% dropped off and 0.4% taxi – total 35.1%) and 51% will be car passengers. The same lower figures have been used in the calculation of the impact of the extra cars on the local road network on matchdays and on street parking.	json-wsp	Marisol Correia	1999			relational database;computer science;data mining;database;public transport	Robotics	10.716873478734247	-7.103737682265737	147219

Contingencies such as unexpected line outages in a stressed system may often result in voltage instability, which may lead to voltage collapse. This paper presents evolutionary algorithm techniques like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) approach for solving the Voltage Stability Constrained Optimal Power Flow (VSC-OPF). Base-case generator power output, voltage magnitude of generator buses are taken as the control variables. Maximum L-index of load buses is used to specify the voltage stability level of the system. An improved GA which permits the control variables to be represented in their natural form is proposed to solve the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem and NSGA II is proposed to solve the VSC-OPF optimization problem. For effective genetic operation, crossover and mutation operators which can directly operate on floating point numbers and integers are used. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus test system. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed NSGA II approach than Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for improving the voltage security of the system.	crossover (genetic algorithm);evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;ibm power systems;instability;mathematical optimization;mutation (genetic algorithm);optimization problem;powera;shadow copy;simulation;software release life cycle;sorting	C.

We analyze the connection between the concept of minmax robust efficiency presented by Ehrgott et al. (Eur J Oper Res, 2014 , doi: 10.1016/j.ejor.2014.03.013 ) and the upper set less order relation $$\preceq _s^u$$ ⪯ s u introduced by Kuroiwa ( 1998 , 1999 ). From this connection we derive new concepts of efficiency for uncertain multi-objective optimization problems by replacing the set ordering with other set orderings. Those are namely the lower set less ordering (see Kuroiwa 1998 , 1999 ), the set less ordering (see Nishnianidze in Soobshch Akad Nauk Gruzin SSR 114(3):489–491, 1984 ; Young in Math Ann 104(1):260–290, 1931 , doi: 10.1007/BF01457934 ; Eichfelder and Jahn in Vector Optimization. Springer, Berlin, 2012 ), the certainly less ordering (see Eichfelder and Jahn in Vector Optimization. Springer, Berlin, 2012 ), and the alternative set less ordering (see Ide et al. in Fixed Point Theory Appl, 2014 , doi: 10.1186/1687-1812-2014-83 ; Kobis 2014 ). We analyze the resulting concepts of efficiency and present numerical results on the occurrence of the various concepts. We conclude the paper with a short comparison between the concepts, and an outlook to further work.

The present work addresses this issue with a specific focus on the network design. First, the paper presents a brief review of computer-based design methods and shows that a significant number of efforts have been pursued. Secondly, it proposes the approach of geometric analysis of the distribution networks as complementary points of the former optimization methods. Finally, an original illustrative application is proposed. The geometric and multi-scale optimization known as the constructal design is used to analytically optimize T-shaped network architectures subject to an operational water quality constraint. This illustrative application leads to the determination of an optimal geometry of the network that minimizes head losses (factor of pumping energy). 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this research is to develop a framework to determine the optimal location of temporary structures in a computerized practical manner for piping construction projects. Based on the spatial relationship between work envelope and scaffolding placement requirements, this paper presents the optimization model in two phases: the simulation-based optimization model and a multi-attribute utility (MAU) based alternative selection model. A multi-objective optimization model is established to improve scaffolding availability among multiple activities while maximizing piping crew productivity. The multi-attribute utility model is employed to handle the uncertainty of the assessment weights on the attributes to illustrate the preference of decision makers among different scaffolding placement alternatives obtained from the first phase. The approach was validated in a piping module, which provided superintendents and space planners with an effective decision-making tool among possible scaffolding alternatives in piping construction. The proposed optimization technique is an alternative methodology for solving the productivity-tasks-scaffolding trade-off problem, which further revolutionizes the spatial coordination process of workspace management and temporary structure planning.	simulation	Haifeng Jin;Mohammad Nahangi;Paul M.

This process is known as multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). Examples of MCDM include decision making in human resource management, water resource management, environmental management and site selection, energy policy issues, portfolio selection, transportation and routing selection, student admission. In general, there are several criteria that need to be satisfied; however, they are usually at least partly conflicting. In this study, we propose a pseudo-boolean approach for multiple criteria decision making on complex system problems. The computational results illustrate both robustness and attractiveness of this solution approach.

International trades have been growing fast since the globalization of world economies intensified in the early 1990s. However, these international trades are typically imbalanced in terms of the numbers of import and export containers. As a result, the relocation of empty containers has become one of the important problems faced by liner shipping companies. In this paper, we consider the empty container allocation problem where we need to determine the optimal volume of empty containers at a port and to reposition empty containers between ports to meet exporters’ demand over time. We formulate this empty container allocation problem as a two-stage model: in stage one, we propose a fuzzy backorder quantity inventory decision making model for determining the optimal quantity of empty container at a port; whereas in stage two, an optimization mathematical programming network model is proposed for determining the optimal number of empty containers to be allocated between ports. The parameters such as the cost of loading container, cost of unloading container, leasing cost of empty container, cost of storing container, supplies, demands and ship capacities for empty containers are considered in this model. By taking advantages of the fuzzy decision making and the network structure, we show how a mixed fuzzy decision making and optimization programming model can be applied to solve the empty container allocation problem. The utilization of the proposed model is demonstrated with a case of trans-Pacific liner route in the real world. Six major container ports on the trans-Pacific route are considered in the case study, including the Port of Kaohsiung, the Port of Hong Kong, the Port of Keelung, the Port of Kobe, the Port of Yokohama and the Port of Los Angles. The results show that the proposed mixed fuzzy decision making and optimization be us programming model can	fuzzy set;log shipping;mathematical optimization;network model;programming model;relocation (computing);source-to-source compiler;web container	Chien-Chang Chou;Rong-Hua Gou;Chaur-Luh Tsai;Ming-Cheng Tsou;Chun-Pong Wong;Hui-Lin Yu	2010	Appl.

9a77ec823b13fa6d61016f6be325cb459f3c5c3a	improving the quality characteristics of abrasive water jet machining of marble material using multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm		Abstract Although abrasive water jet machining has proved its capabilities for cutting marble material in a most economic and environment friendly manner, is facing serious issues related to dimensional inaccuracy and striation marks. This has put limit on its applications. Also, due to complex nature of abrasive water jet machining process, it is very difficult to control all three quality factors i.e. kerf taper, kerf width, striation marks simultaneously to achieve desired quality. This work therefore deals with multi-objective optimization considering three objectives as: minimization of kerf width, minimization of kerf taper, and maximization of depth of striation free surface in abrasive water jet machining process. The response surface modeling is used to establish the relation between various input parameters such as stand of distance, traverse speed, water pressure, and abrasive flow rate, with objectives mentioned above. Application of well-known meta-heuristics named artificial bee colony algorithm is extended to multi-objective optimization with posteriori approach by incorporating the concept of non-dominated sorting. Set of Pareto optimal solutions obtained by this proposed approach provides a ready reference for selecting most appropriate parameter setting on the machine with respect to objectives considered in this work.	artificial bee colony algorithm;marble	Padmakar J.

Both applications are interactive with Google Maps, and based on the selected input parameters (such as the origin and destination of sales persons, the way of planning, any possible obstacles, etc.) they visually show the results, indicators and analysis. The commercial version of the software, eSalesmanPlan, which uses the aforementioned algorithms, is used in several companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. All indicators point to significant savings both in human as well as financial resources and it will be also presented.	algorithm;breadth-first search;depth-first search;matlab;mathematical optimization;oracle application development framework;simulation;web application	Emir Zunic;Almir Djedovic;B.

A successful PHEV design requires not only optimal component sizes but also proper control strategy. In this paper, a global optimization method, called parallel chaos optimization algorithm (PCOA), is used to optimize simultaneously the PHEV component sizes and control strategy. In order to minimize the cost, energy consumption (EC), and emissions, a multiobjective nonlinear optimization problem is formulated and recast as a single objective optimization problem by weighted aggregation. The driving performance requirements of the PHEV are considered as the constraints. In addition, to evaluate the objective function, the optimization process is performed over three typical driving cycles including Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET), and New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for reducing the fuel cost, EC and emissions while ensuring that the vehicle performance has not been sacrificed.	algorithm	Xiaolan Wu;Guifang Guo;Jun Xu;Binggang Cao	2014	I.

The proposed evolutionary method is based on the Pareto optimality concept to equally optimize multiple objective functions providing a set of optimal solutions Pareto front, where the network manager can select an option. An original combination of evolutionary computation and spanning trees theories is put forward to ensure an efficient convergence of solutions without violating technical and topological constraints. The simulations were carried out in a standard IEEE 33 bus test system. The obtained results prove the capability of the proposed method to converge to the best minimum values of objective functions using a very small population size. Furthermore, the comparisons with other methods in the literature show the robustness and promptness of the suggested method.

Structural integrity control becomes highly sensitive to interventions under a potential loss of structural integrity when it comes to offshore oil and gas production and process facilities. This is mainly due to the inherent constraints present in carrying out engineering work in the offshore atmosphere. It has been further exacerbated by the ageing offshore structures and the necessity of carrying out life extension toward the end of their design service lives. Local and international regulations demand the implementation of appropriate strengthening, modification and repair plans when significant changes in the structural integrity are revealed. In this context, strengthening, modification and repair techniques such as welding, member removal/reduction of loading, mechanical clamping and grouted repairs play a vital role. This manuscript presents an approach for prioritizing the strengthening, modification and repair techniques using a multi-criteria analysis approach. An analytic hierarchy process has been selected for the analysis via an illustrative case. It also provides a comprehensive overview of currently existing; strengthening, modification and repair techniques and their comparative pros and cons. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, the input data or related parameters are frequently imprecise / fuzzy owing to incomplete or unobtainable information, which can be represented as a fuzzy numbers. This paper presents a multiobjective multipheromone ant colony optimization approach (MM-ACO) with an application in fuzzy multiobjective human resource allocation problem. Our approach has two characteristic features. Firstly, a set of nondominated solutions is obtained by exploring the optimal Pareto frontier using differentα cut level and subsequently, based on the definition of Pareto stability, the Pareto frontier may be reduced to manageable sizes (i.e., Stable Pareto optimal solutions) where in a practical sense only Pareto optimal solutions that are stable are of interest, since there are always uncertainties associated with the efficiency data. Furthermore, we provided an example of optimum utilization of human resources in reclamation of derelict land in Toshka-Egypt.	ant colony optimization algorithms;archeological map of egypt;fuzzy number;mathematical optimization;multistage amplifier;pareto efficiency	Abd Allah A.

6423cc33b8e1a69b6dd50eea804558901c8d96c9	a multi-objective optimization approach associated to climate change analysis to improve systematic conservation planning		Biodiversity conservation has been since long an academic community concern, leading scientists to propose strategies to effectively meet conservation goals. In particular, Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) aims to determine the most cost effective way of investing in conservation actions. SCP can be formalized by the Set-Covering Problem, which is NP-hard. SCP is inherently multi-objective, although it has been usually treated with a monobjective and static approach. Here, we propose a multi-objective solution for SCP, increasing its flexibility and complexity, and, at the same time, augmenting the quality of provided information, which reinforces decision-making. We used ensemble forecasting, considering future climate simulations to estimate species occurrence projected to 2080. Our method identifies sites: 1) of high priority for conservation; 2) with significant risk of investment; and, 3) that may become attractive in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this application to a real-world problem in ecology is the first attempt to apply multi-objective optimization to SCP associated to climate forecasting, in a dynamic spatial prioritization analysis for biodiversity conservation.	multi-objective optimization;optimizing compiler	Shana Schlottfeldt;Jonathan Timmis;Maria Emilia Telles Walter;André Carlos Ponce de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho;Lorena M.

1401d385b42f0ed9e5c0cccf5d02ee531784abea	optimal stochastic eco-routing solutions for electric vehicles		A stochastic energy aware routing framework is proposed for electric vehicles with the goal of enhancing the sustainability of future electrified transportation systems. A stochastic decision making framework is introduced to handle the random effects of environmental factors on transportation energy cost. The problem of optimal routing is formulated as a stochastic programming problem and risk control of the overall energy is applied to find the minimum energy route. The original discrete optimization problem is tackled using convex relaxation and transformation. The optimal path is constructed using a highly efficient primal-dual interior point algorithm for the relaxed problem with a subsequent reconstruction of the solution for the original discrete problem. Two electric drive limitations, i.e., battery capacity and drive line efficiency, are made an integral part of the decision making framework in order to obtain realistic results by incorporating actual vehicle data. Detailed simulations demonstrate the utility of the introduced approach and its superiority to existing, traditional routing engines.		Zonggen Yi;Peter H.

Furthermore, no research exists on mathematical modeling of S&OP in dairy industry. This study is going to investigate the benefits of S&OP using a mathematical modeling approach. Three novel Mixed Integer Programming models are presented to do so: a Fully Integrated S&OP (FI-S&OP) model, a Partially Integrated S&OP (PI-S&OP) model, and a decoupled planning (DP) model. All these models are developed for a multi-site manufacturing company, which is coping with various raw material suppliers and Third Party Logistics (3PLs), Distribution Centers (DCs), and customers with wide range of product families. Finally, all the models are applied in a real case in a dairy manufacturing company in Iran. The results demonstrate a slight superiority of FI-S&OP over PI-S&OP model and a strong domination over DP model.	automated planning and scheduling;iranian.com	Yaser Nemati;Mehrdad Madhoshi;Abdolhamid Safaei Ghadikolaei	2017	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.05.002	simulation;engineering;sales and operations planning;operations research	AI	11.93182071639505	-3.0378412151924636	159776

Our approach is based on timed Coloured Petri nets and simulation techniques exploiting such nets. In particular, we demonstrate on a simplified model from the real environment that the whole system is very predisposed to insufficiency. Especially, in any case of even a little delay the whole system begins to fail transfer people fluently. First of all, the main preliminaries are presented and after that we describe our approach and model in more details.	coloured petri net	Dusan Kolár;Sárka Kvetonová	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27549-4_25	simulation;computer science;process architecture;petri net	Vision	10.197879318898405	-9.766399273524808	161209
1f1ed158b591b0b51442c3d18b9b3e2633b2112b	vulnerability distribution model of critical infrastructures based on topological system simulation		Urban critical infrastructures provide citizens with lifeline functions such as water, electricity and energy, etc. These interconnected infrastructure systems require reliable models for vulnerability measurement and topological controllability against usual disruptions and unusual hazards. This paper proposes a vulnerability distribution model to describe vulnerability distribution patterns in critical infrastructure system. To describe transmission of vulnerability between different infrastructure components or topological nodes, a vulnerability distribution network (VDN) is developed for simulation of negative impact on each node. The results are represented in a rasterized distribution diagrams by three metrics of vulnerability: the total number of effective topological nodes, the node’s serviceability and the descent rate of coverage of infrastructural service. Then this model is applied to a case study of a local gas system and a local electric power system. Results show that a node’s vulnerability and serviceability is closely related to the node’s degree, especially the out-degree, while overall system’s vulnerability is greatly affected by descent rate of coverage of each infrastructural service node. The model also generates probabilistic simulation graphs to show continuous vulnerability distribution in areas covered by the specified critical infrastructure systems. The graphic representation of VDN model results further helps infrastructure managers conduct route planning for transportation of hazard goods and optimize allocation of emergency resources.	simulation	Xiaobo Yao;Chuanfeng Han;Qian Chen;Lingpeng Meng	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91635-4_26	controllability;serviceability (structure);electric power system;probabilistic logic;critical infrastructure;topology;business;vulnerability;graph	Metrics	10.120784488528372	-7.724805291002936	161619

Both are used in a situation in which two users depart from different points simultaneously, but they want to reach common goal. One mode of navigation is used in a situation in which both users want to reach the goal independently. The navigation system calculates each route and arrival time for each user. If the two arrival times differ, then the system suggests another route with a dropping point such as a store or park to the user who will reach the goal earlier. The other navigation is used in a situation in which two users want to join somewhere before reaching a common goal. The navigation system suggests not only a juncture point, but also suggests routes from each departure point to the juncture point, and a route from the juncture point to the goal. We developed a prototype system using the city center of Wakayama as a test area. Using it, we evaluated the proposed navigations.	prototype;time of arrival	Masato Soga;Kazuyoshi Kadomoto	2011		10.1145/2030112.2030209	turn-by-turn navigation;simulation;computer security;mobile robot navigation	Robotics	14.479515318462173	-8.060432069222735	162221

For the first time, this uncertainty is treated by a robust multiobjective formulation in the gist of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski. For this novel formulation, we investigate its relationship to the original multiobjective formulation as well as to its scalarizations. Further, we provide a characterization of the location of the robust Pareto frontier with respect to the corresponding original Pareto frontier and show that standard techniques from multiobjective optimization can be employed to characterize this robust efficient frontier. We illustrate our results based on a standard mean–variance problem.	mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	Jörg Fliege;Ralf Werner	2014	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2013.10.028	mathematical optimization;uncertainty;mathematics;mathematical economics;welfare economics;statistics	EDA	17.303698985548714	-6.3458409604518	162671

In this paper, we leverage the benefits that Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications provide in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), to optimize traffic assignment in transportation networks. In particular, we formulate a convex optimization problem for a transportation network and minimize network criticality, a new graph metric that measures centrality. The robustness of this solution is studied and compared to that of the System Optimal Equilibrium (SOE) Optimization. The results show that using network criticality provides robustness (lack of sensitivity) to both increases in traffic demand and decreases in traffic supply, thus reducing traffic congestion.	centrality;convex optimization;distance (graph theory);mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimization problem;program optimization;school of everything;self-organized criticality;vehicle-to-vehicle	Agop Koulakezian;Hazem M.

However, there is no formal structure to define the integration between simulation and optimization. This deters the development of simulation-based optimization methods that have a proper balance between the desired features (i.e. generality, efficiency, high-dimensionality and transparency). This research provides two contributions to the problem above by providing: 1) the design of the framework that facilitates the fulfillment of the aforementioned features; 2) the implementation of the framework in Java. The proposed framework is developed based on Zeigler's modeling and simulation framework and the phases of an optimization study in operations research.

Max/max price penalty factor is considered in the multi-objective function of (CEED). The fuel cost is presented with 4 parameters (a, c, d, and e). Simulated annealing approach is our method to find the optimal solution. The simulated annealing algorithm is used to minimize the fuel cost and the gas emissions as SO2, NOx, and CO2 in the same time. In this study, in order to evaluate the proposed method, we applied it on 6-unit system with cubic fuel cost and cubic emission functions. The results obtained from SA method are compared with Lagrange method and particle swarm optimization. The results show that the SA algorithm is better than the others at solving such the problem of combined emission and power dispatch.	algorithm;cubic function;dynamic dispatch;loss function;mathematical optimization;newton's method;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;simulated annealing	Ismail Ziane;Farid Benhamida;Amel Graa	2016	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-016-2335-3	mathematical optimization;simulation	EDA	17.294445047042664	-3.5825657603215424	164582

While the CVaR model is popularly used in financial portfolio optimization problems, its application in hazmat transportation is new.

8c79de3ad878e05c4bb28e2996659331e18218fb	let's go for a run: planning routes to remember		Research shows that people handle the complexity of environments by cognitively simplifying them using spatial schemas and heuristics. Such simplification strategies can be seen in route planning situations, such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and tour planning. The present study extends this work by examining a situation where memory demands must be considered during route planning -planning a running route through an unfamiliar area. Results of routes planned on maps in grid-like and non-grid-like environments suggest that the planned routes reflect aspects of cognitive simplification to meet memory demands. This was evident in both global and local features of the routes. Globally, route trajectories tended towards simple shapes in accord with the affordances of the environment. Locally, changes of direction were preferably chosen at landmarks. More demanding (non-grid) environments led to an increase in simplification strategy use, such as relying on major roads, and avoiding complex decision points.	heuristic (computer science);level of detail;map;text simplification;travelling salesman problem	Holly A.

In multi-objective GAs, there are two important problems : how to assign a fitness for each individual, and how to make the diversified individuals. In order to overcome those problems, this paper suggests a new multi-objective GA using generalized data envelopment analysis (GDEA). Through numerical examples, the paper shows that the proposed method using GDEA can generate well-distributed as well as well-approximated Pareto frontiers with less number of function evaluations.	genetic algorithm;multi-objective optimization	Yeboon Yun;Min Yoon;Hirotaka Nakayama	2005		10.1007/11539902_49	econometrics;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science;multi-objective optimization;data envelopment analysis;mathematics;mathematical economics;data analysis	EDA	16.414445520991755	-5.740380540899629	166514

In response to this threat, the US Navy has developed a visualization tool known as the Pirate Attack Risk Surface (PARS) that integrates intelligence data, commercial shipping routes, and meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information to predict regions where pirates may be present and where they may strike next. This paper proposes an algorithmic augmentation or add-on to PARS that allocates interdiction and surveillance assets so as to minimize the likelihood of a successful pirate attack over a fixed planning horizon. This augmentation, viewed as a tool for human planners, can be mapped closely to the decision support layer of the Battlespace on Demand (BonD) framework [32]. Our solution approach decomposes this NP-hard optimization problem into two sequential phases. In Phase I, we solve the problem of allocating only the interdiction assets, such that regions with high cumulative probability of attack over the planning horizon are maximally covered. In Phase II, we solve the surveillance problem, where the area not covered by interdiction assets is partitioned into non-overlapping search regions (e.g., rectangular boxes) and assigned to a set of surveillance assets to maximize the cumulative detection probability over the planning horizon. In order to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with Dynamic Programming (DP), we propose a Gauss-Seidel algorithm coupled with a rollout strategy for the interdiction problem. For the surveillance problem, we propose a partitioning algorithm coupled with an asymmetric assignment algorithm for allocating assets to the partitioned regions. Once the surveillance assets are assigned to search regions, the search path for each asset is determined based on a specific search strategy. The proposed algorithms are illustrated using a hypothetical scenario for conducting counter-piracy operations in a given Area of Responsibility (AOR).	add-ons for firefox;approximation algorithm;bayesian programming;curse of dimensionality;decision support system;dynamic programming;ensemble forecasting;gauss–seidel method;geographic coordinate system;heuristic;information gain in decision trees;map;mathematical optimization;multi-armed bandit;np-hardness;optimization problem;path (variable);program counter;randomness;recursion;state space;usb on-the-go;viz: the computer game	Woosun An;Diego Fernando Martinez Ayala;David Sidoti;Manisha Mishra;Xu Han;Krishna R.

Unidirectional A* algorithm guarantees an optimal route but requires considerable search time. On the other hand, bidirectional A* algorithm, usually known faster than unidirectional A*, does not guarantee the route found to be optimal, if the search ends when the forward and backward search meet in the middle. It may even take longer than unidirectional search to find an optimal route. In this paper, a new modified bidirectional A* algorithm which takes less search time and guarantees an optimal route is proposed. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, several experiments are conducted in real urban road environment and the results show that the algorithm is very effective in terms of finding an optimal route and search time.	algorithm	Taeg Keun Whangbo	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73325-6_34	beam search;mathematical optimization;bidirectional search;simulation;heuristic;beam stack search;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;incremental heuristic search;best-first search;search algorithm	Theory	15.09177703763981	-7.943029344169824	170353

Recovery of products has many advantages to companies in reducing costs and protecting the environment. In this study, one of the recovery options, namely reuse, is analysed. For this pursuit, a mathematical model is developed to plan production and distribution of the reusable products as well as the new products by considering the forward and reverse flows of the products. The model is a multi-echelon supply chain model composed of multiple customers, multiple distributors, multiple transshipment points, and a factory. Due to vagueness, ambiguity and lack of information in the reverse logistics, the problem is constructed and solved under the fuzzy environment. The model is implemented on a hypothetical supply chain network based on an industrial case, and the results of the model are compared with the results of the other methods.	mathematical model	Irem Otay;Ferhan Çebi	2016	IJIDS	10.1504/IJIDS.2016.10001389	fuzzy logic;supply chain management;computer science;marketing;operations management;mathematical model;management science	ML	12.724563327612515	-3.5643039876608564	174239

Assessing a potential solution requires aggregating in some way the outcomes of a very large or infinite number of such interactions. This layer of complexity presents difficulties for algorithm design that are not encountered in ordinary optimization. For example, what a co-optimization algorithm should output is not at all obvious.  Theoretical research has shown that some output selection mechanisms yield better overall performance than others and described an optimal mechanism. This mechanism was shown to be strictly better than a greedy method in common use, but appeared prohibitive from a practical standpoint. In this paper we exhibit the optimal output mechanism for a particular class of co-optimization problems and a certain definition of better overall performance, and provide quantitative characterizations of domains for which this optimal mechanism becomes straightforward to implement. We conclude with a discussion of potential extensions of this work to other problem classes and other views on performance.	algorithm design;computer performance;entity;greedy algorithm;interaction;optimization problem	Elena Popovici;Ezra Winston;Anthony Bucci	2011		10.1145/1967654.1967659	optimization problem;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;mathematics;solution concept;algorithm	AI	16.349273529161962	-7.897819816349404	174294
477f63828d23f6b5e9bc68b0171c0ca1ff150d5f	applying microprocessor analysis methods to river network modelling	saint venant equations;vlsi;continental river dynamics;dynamic simulation	This paper describes the Simulation Program for River Networks (SPRINT) that is proposed as a tool for studying Continental River Dynamics (CRD), the solution of physics-based equations for large-scale river networks. Existing coupled hydrologic/hydraulic models have been unable to solve the full Saint-Venant equations for river networks larger than O(10) elements, but continental scales require 10 to 10 elements. The new model solves the full nonlinear Saint-Venant equations for one-dimensional (1D) unsteady flow and stage height in river channel networks with non-uniform bathymetry, and is demonstrated to compute networks of O(10) elements more than 330 times faster than real time on a desktop computer. The model incorporates ideas that were originally developed to address Very Large System Integration (VLSI) problems in microprocessor design, where solving large nonlinear computational problems is a common challenge. Computational speed is increased by applying Jacobian bypass techniques in a Newton-Raphson solution and smoothing the geometric depth-area and friction-area relationships where discontinuities otherwise slow convergence. Pre-processing of junction relationships is used to remove temporal nonlinearities where river tributaries meet. Model input/output are simplified and made readily accessible to other software through use of Application Programming Interface (API) standards and a “netlist” idea that was previously used to describe electric circuit topology. The model is tested on both simple and complex geometry through comparisons with the HEC-RAS model. A example simulation is conducted for 1.5× 10 river km of the Guadalupe and San Antonio river network during a 14 day rain event.

1d67536120ba942570edb0be38b1cb75bf7867a7	fuzzy goal programming for multi-level multi-objective problem: an additive model	qa63 problem solving	This coordination of decision authority is noteworthy especially in a complex multi-level structured organization, which faces multi-objective problems to achieve overall organization targets. However, the standard formulation of mathematical programming problems assumes that a single decision maker made the decisions. Nevertheless it should be appropriate to establish the formulations of mathematical models based on multi-level programming method embracing multiple objectives. Yet, it is realized that sometimes estimating the coefficients of objective functions in the multi-objective model are difficult when the statistical data contain random and fuzzy information. Hence, this paper proposes a fuzzy goal programming additive model, to solve a multi-level multi-objective problem in a fuzzy environment, which can attain a satisfaction solution. A numerical example of production planning problem illustrates the solution. A numerical example of production planning problem illustrates the proposed solution approach and highlights its advantages that consider the inherent uncertainties in developing the multi-level multi-objective model.	additive model;goal programming	Nureize Arbaiy;Junzo Watada	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22191-0_7	mathematical optimization;computer science;management science	ECom	13.211248472647592	-4.929230291936819	174579

In the problem, the coefficients and right hand side values of the constraints and the objective function coefficients are defined as fuzzy numbers. The addressed problem also has a multiple objective structure where the goals are determined so as to minimize the total cost and the imbalance between the workload of the agents. The direct solution approach utilizes the fuzzy ranking methods to rank the objective function values and to determine the feasibility of the constraints within a metaheuristic search algorithm, known as bees algorithm. Different fuzzy ranking methods, namely signed distance, integral value and area based approach are used in bees algorithm. For the computational study, the effects of these fuzzy ranking methods on the quality of the solutions are also analyzed.	bees algorithm;fuzzy concept	Pinar Tapkan;Lale Özbakir;Adil Baykasoglu	2013	Expert Syst.

In these multi-objective optimisation problems, solution optimising all the objective functions simultaneously does not exist, in general. Instead, Pareto-optimal solutions, which are efficient in terms of all objective functions, are introduced. Nevertheless, many optimal solutions exist. A final solution among Pareto-optimal solutions is to be selected based on the balance among objective functions. In this paper, we find fuzzy efficient and Pareto-optimal solution to the multi-objective linear fractional programming problem (MOLFP). It has shown that when any fuzzy goal is fully achieved, the fuzzy efficient solution may or may not be Pareto-optimal. Therefore, a procedure is proposed to obtain fuzzy efficient solution which is also Pareto-optimal. The efficiency of proposed method is verified by numerical examples and a practical application in production planning.	fractional programming;linear-fractional programming;pareto efficiency	Pitam Singh;Shiv Datt Kumar;Rakesh K Singh	2014	IJMOR	10.1504/IJMOR.2014.060854	fractional programming;mathematical optimization;basic solution;linear-fractional programming;fuzzy number;goal programming;control theory;mathematics;mathematical economics	Theory	15.4382745020168	-4.299642229689002	175686

However, reducing the weight of the devices directly affects the energy efficiency. In this paper, a solution to this problem is proposed for the case of wound rotor synchronous generators. The trade-off between cost and efficiency is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a Genetic Algorithm. The cost optimization of three different machines is carried out through various design approaches. The proposed approach always gives better results than the classical approach concerning the global cost of the range.	genetic algorithm	Xavier Jannot;Philippe Dessante;Pierre Vidal;Jean-Claude Vannier	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-16225-1_5	genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;efficient energy use;constrained optimization;permanent magnet synchronous generator;wound rotor motor;multi-objective optimization;computer science	Theory	17.221624811557856	-3.751911096695958	177684

To facilitate this design procedure, a framework linking an evolutionary multiobjective algorithm (EMOA) with a biomanufacturing process economics model is presented. The EMOA is tuned to discover sequences of chromatographic purification steps, and equipment sizing strategies adopted at each step, that provide the best trade-off with respect to multiple objectives including cost of goods per gram (COG/g), robustness in COG/g, and impurity removal capabilities. The framework also simulates and optimizes subject to various process uncertainties and design constraints. Experiments on an industrially-relevant case study showed that the EMOA is able to discover purification processes that outperform the industrial standard, and revealed several interesting trade-offs between the objectives.	evolutionary algorithm;purification of quantum state	Richard Allmendinger;Suzanne S.

This paper introduces a multiparameter route selection system which employs fuzzy logic (FL) for local pheromone updating of an ant colony system (ACS) in detection of optimum multiparameter direction between two desired points, origin and destination (O/D). The importance rates of parameters such as path length and traffic are adjustable by the user. In this system, online traffic data are supplied directly by a traffic control center (TCC) and further minutes traffic data are predicted by employing artificial neural networks (ANNs).

The wind fields provided by these models are interpolations of surface and upper-air observations within constraints such as mass conservation. The inputs for diagnostic wind models are generally obtained from operational weather monitoring networks, which are often established for purposes other than to provide data to diagnostic models. As a result, the data available may not be optimum for calculating accurate wind fields. In particular, measurement locations may be poorly distributed. In this case, it is desirable to add monitoring stations to supplement existing measurements. We have developed an objective approach to identify the best location for one or more additional stations. The placement of new monitoring stations can be cast as an optimization problem. The best new locations should result in the forecasted wind fields being closest to the actual wind fields. Such an optimization task is not trivial because the response surface of the cost function on the location parameters to be optimized could be very complicated. The complication results from the complex nature of meteorological processes and the nonlinear behavior of location parameters affecting the evaluation of the cost function. Thismore » complexity usually precludes an analytical solution. For this work we used a genetic algorithm (GA) as the optimization tool to search for the optimum locations of new monitoring stations to be added to an existing meteorological network located in the city of Chicago, Illinois. Because complicated wind fields pose the greatest challenge for diagnostic models, we identified dates on which typical examples of such wind fields occurred in the city. These wind fields were modeled with the Pennsylvania State University/NCAR mesoscale model (MM5) using four-dimensional data assimilation. The MM5 results were used as surrogate observations. Wind components at the candidate station locations and at the locations of existing stations were sampled from MM5 and treated as actual observations. These “observations” were provided as inputs to an EPA-recommended diagnostic model, CALMET, to produce diagnostic wind fields. The calculated difference between the diagnosed wind fields and the MM5 wind fields was used to create the cost function in the optimization. The simulation and optimization approach was illustrated by the selection of a single additional surface station to improve the diagnosed wind field for a typical lake breeze episode near the city of Chicago.« less	genetic algorithm	YuLong Xie;William Shaw;Weiguo Wang;Timothy Seiple;Jeremy Rishel;Frederick Rutz;Elaine Chapman;Jerry Allwine	2007			simulation;remote sensing;genetic algorithm;data assimilation;mesoscale meteorology;mm5;air quality index;optimization problem;engineering	Logic	10.734061541922518	-6.1054394608784985	180165

9938f7305b746e1750165cffc027b47db25ffddd	fuzzy measure on vehicle routing problem of hospital materials	fuzzy measure;vehicle routing problem;programming model;hospital material	The traditional programming model is used to assume that each objective stands independently from one another; however, in reality, some interactions might exist between the criteria or attributes. In order to understand the problem of incomplete independence objectives, this study explores whether fuzzy measure is suitable for the vehicle routing problem or not. With the hospital operation scale expanding, the vehicle transmitting routing, which used to be planned by artificial and partly practical experience, has already insufficient. This study solves the vehicle routing problem by using the fuzzy measure method. It brings up a solving model to solve the immediate problem faced by the department of medical material transmitting in the hospital. Additionally, this study compares the fuzzy measure method with other programming methods, and takes Chang Gung Children’s Hospital as the research objective. This study will demonstrate that it is unnecessary to consider the independence problem between objectives and the result of the programming is closer to the decision-maker’s requirement when the fuzzy measure method is applied to objective programming. Besides, this study model can be regarded as a reference when the department of medical material transmitting in the hospital meditates its new transmitting routing in the future, or estimates present transmitting routing. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

c5aede3139f6da733085f10be6ff551034f785d0	design a reverse logistics information system with rfid	reverse logistic;information system	Recently, reverse logistics management has become an integral part of the business cycle. This is mainly due to the need to be environmental friendly and urgent need to reuse scarce resources. Traditionally, reverse logistics activities have been a cost center for most businesses without generating extra revenue. However, due to recent increase in commodity and energy prices, reverse logistics management could eventually be a cost savings method. In this research, we propose using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to better optimize and streamline reverse logistics operations. Using RFID, we try to eliminate parts of the unknowns in reverse logistics flow that made reverse logistics model complicated. Furthermore, Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the place of initial collection center so as to cover the largest population possible in order to reduce logistics cost and provide convenience to end users.

This optimization model not only considers investment alternatives to fleet capacity expansion concerning building new ships, purchase or sale of second-hand ships, charter ships, but also takes into account many factors such as the economic status of the ships, ship deployment, the investment capacity of enterprise, etc., as well as reflects how much weight the decision makers have given to physical value of the fleet at the end of the research horizon. Lastly, effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated using a shipping enterprise as an example. Results indicate that, the model well meets the practical needs of the fleet planning decision-making and ship operation organizations, thus it can be applied to the fleet planning study on industrial transport or liner trunk transport.	integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;programming model;software deployment	Qiuping Yang;Xinlian Xie;Weiwei Huo	2009	2009 Second International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design	10.1109/ISCID.2009.130	planning;mathematical optimization;integer programming;investment;computer science;operations research	Robotics	10.765463881348529	-3.409870194775715	185885

Then, two fuzzy logic controllers, one for optimized green time of traffic lights and one green phase is used for an extended time. In this system, types of sensors is video detection, they are placed strategically at incoming and outgoing legs (lines) and the controller utilize the information received from these sensors to make optimal decisions to minimize the goal function. The simulation results show that TAOSF (Traffic Actuated Optimization Signal Fuzzy control) had a great improvement in 6 different traffic conditions such as certain, uncertain, using random data, and in 4 different traffic conditions using the real case study of OSTANDARI intersection in Mashhad, Iran, in comparison with the fixed time controller, real operation of Australian SCATS (Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System) system, TASFC (Traffic Actuated Signal Fuzzy Control) system in previous work for estimation of the goal function which is minimizing the queue length and the delay time of the vehicles.	fuzzy logic;mathematical optimization	Hamid Saadat Talab;Hadiseh Mohammadkhani	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-141127	real-time computing;simulation;state-space representation;fuzzy number	EDA	11.237559988948757	-9.308406539833767	185993

Mass customization manufacturing thus has emerged as a new trend for its aiming to satisfy the needs of individual customers. This process of offering a wide product variety often induces an exponential growth in the volume of information and redundancy for data storage. Thus, a technique for managing product configuration is necessary, on the one hand, to provide customers faster configured and lower priced products, and on the other hand, to translate customers’ needs into the product information needed for tendering and manufacturing. This paper presents a decision-making scheme through constructing a product family model ~PFM! first, in which the relationship between product, modules, and components are defined. The PFM is then transformed into a product configuration network. A product configuration problem assuming that customers would like to have a minimum-cost and customized product can be easily solved by finding the shortest path in the corresponding product configuration network. Genetic algorithms ~GAs!, mathematical programming, and tree-searching methods such as uniform-cost search and iterative deepening A* are applied to obtain solutions to this problem. An empirical case is studied in this work as an example. Computational results show that the solution quality of GAs retains 93.89% for a complicated configuration problem. However, the running time of GAs outperforms the running time of other methods with a minimum speed factor of 25. This feature is very useful for a real-time system.	computation;computer data storage;configuration management;dijkstra's algorithm;genetic algorithm;google translate;iterative deepening depth-first search;iterative method;knowledge-based configuration;mathematical optimization;procurement;real-time clock;real-time computing;shortest path problem;time complexity	Jinn-Yi Yeh;Tai-Hsi Wu	2005	AI EDAM	10.1017/S0890060405050043	simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;product design;configuration;empirical research;engineering drawing;new product development;product engineering	AI	13.57779695318373	-4.456798813386273	187443
1a99d0b9f9893b1cd63d553b8a2540c62ad9668a	reliability-based design optimization with cooperation between support vector machine and particle swarm optimization		Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is concerned with designing an engineering system to minimize a cost function subject to the reliability requirement that failure probability should not exceed a threshold. Conventional RBDO methods are less than satisfactory in dealing with discrete design parameters and complex limit state functions (nonlinear and non-differentiable). Methods that are flexible enough to address the concerns above, however, come at a high computational cost. To enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing model flexibility, we propose a new RBDO framework: PS2, which combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Subset Simulation (SS). SS can efficiently estimate small failure probabilities, based on which SVM is adopted to evaluate the reliability of candidate solutions using binary classification. PSO is employed to solve the discrete optimization problem. Primary emphasis is placed upon the cooperation between SVM and PSO. The cooperation is mutually beneficial since the SVM classifier helps PSO evaluate the feasibility of solutions with high efficiency while the optimal solutions obtained by PSO assist in retraining the SVM classifier to attain better accuracy. The PS2 framework is implemented to find the optimal design of a ten-bar truss, whose component sizes are selected from a commercial standard. The reliability constraints are non-differentiable with two failure modes: yield stress and buckling stress. The interactive process between PSO and SVM contributes greatly to the success of the PS2 framework. It is shown that in various trials the PS2 framework consistently outperforms both the double-loop and single-loop approaches in terms of computational efficiency, solution quality, and model flexibility.	algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;binary classification;buckling;computation;discrete optimization;loss function;mit engineering systems division;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal design;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;rejection sampling;subset simulation;support vector machine;time complexity	I-Tung Yang;Yi-Hung Hsieh	2011	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-011-0251-9	mathematical optimization;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining	AI	16.83124116864932	-5.255642113779809	189510

This paper develops a multi- objective mathematic model for design of the reverse logistics network for solid wastes. The objectives are defined to minimize both total cost of construction and negative impact on people produced by treatment facilities for solid wastes. Solving the model, the locations , numbers and capacities of treatment facilities and the allocation of waste generation sites to treatment facilities can be determined. So, a reverse logistics network can be designed. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm employing the problem-specific heuristic knowledge is presented. The Pareto optimal solution set obtained by the algorithm is shown to be useful for the decisionmaker. Finally, the model has been applied to a practical example in China.	evolutionary algorithm;facility location problem;genetic algorithm;heuristic;logistics;pareto efficiency;utility	Geng Liu;Bo He;Chao Yang	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.71	mathematical optimization;engineering;operations management;management science	AI	10.615682770037095	-5.049513145902291	190846

Through development of a variety of AI-based scheduling systems, it became well known that eliciting effective problem-solving knowledge from human experts is a difficult task, and human schedulers typically lack the knowledge of solving large and complicated scheduling problems in the sophisticated manner. In this paper, out case-based approach, implemented in the system called CABINS, is presented for capturing a human expert's preferential criteria about schedule quality and control knowledge to speed up problem solving. By iterative schedule repair, CABINS improves the quality of sub-optimal schedules, and during the process CABINS utilizes past repair experiences for (1) repair tactic selection and (2) repair result evaluation. It is empirically demonstrated that CABINS can optimize a schedule along objectives captured in its case base and improve the efficiency of optimization process while preserving the quality of a resultant schedule.	genetic algorithm scheduling;knowledge acquisition;mathematical optimization	Kazuo Miyashita	1995	AI in Engineering	10.1016/0954-1810(95)00001-Y	job shop scheduling;quality control;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;scheduling	AI	16.059296154498618	-6.574318271363902	191208
4f1d64e291179a7c46e317a35cc68bfcf7d8cab5	grouping genetic algorithms - advances and applications		This book presents advances and innovations in grouping genetic algorithms, enriched with new and unique heuristic optimization techniques. These algorithms are specially designed for solving industrial grouping problems where system entities are to be partitioned or clustered into efficient groups according to a set of guiding decision criteria. Examples of such problems are: vehicle routing problems, team formation problems, timetabling problems, assembly line balancing, group maintenance planning, modular design, and task assignment. A wide range of industrial grouping problems, drawn from diverse fields such as logistics, supply chain management, project management, manufacturing systems, engineering design and healthcare, are presented. Typical complex industrial grouping problems, with multiple decision criteria and constraints, are clearly described using illustrative diagrams and formulations. The problems are mapped into a common group structure that can conveniently be used as an input scheme to specific variants of grouping genetic algorithms. Unique heuristic grouping techniques are developed to handle grouping problems efficiently and effectively. Illustrative examples and computational results are presented in tables and graphs to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms. Researchers, decision analysts, software developers, and graduate students from various disciplines will find this in-depth reader-friendly exposition of advances and applications of grouping genetic algorithms an interesting, informative and valuable resource.	genetic algorithm;xslt/muenchian grouping	Michael Mutingi;Charles Mbohwa	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-44394-2	quality control and genetic algorithms;genetic representation	AI	12.99026309678852	-3.5858140725901766	191233

In real world applications, multiple sources of uncertainties are needed to be treated in providing higher quality schedules. This paper presents a seminal research on the application of fuzzy set theory to the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) to treat uncertainties in the target values of the hospital management and nurses’ preferences. More specifically, a new multi-objective integer programming model for the NSP is developed. Then, based on this model three fuzzy goal programming models are developed using different fuzzy solution approaches. A real world application is presented to confirm the viability of the proposed models. Also, to provide the decision maker for a more confident solution set for policy decision making, a sensitivity analysis is performed. Additionally, to show the efficiency of the proposed model, it is applied to several problem instances. The paper contributes to the literature by revealing that fuzzy modeling approaches can effectively be used in the NSP in providing schedules which are more personalized and equitable for nurses, and more satisfying for hospital management. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the algorithm, the new inertial parameter was used, and two layers independent sub-swarms were cooperative optimised. The catastrophe occurred when inferior sub-swarms sink into a local optimum value, which can make the population evolve forward continuously, prevent an algorithm precocious refrain, insure obtain the global optimum solution. The experiment study shows that the ILPPSO algorithm can improve the searching ability, get the optimum result. Aiming at the expressway interchange jam problem, the traditional ramp fuzzy control algorithm is not ideal. This paper applies the ILPPSO algorithm to optimise the interchange ramp control parameters. The simulation results show that the ICPPSO algorithm was more effective than the standard PSO algorithm and genetic algorithm, and was able to carry out real-time parameters optimisation of interchange ramp control.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization	Ruichun He;Changxi Ma	2015	IJCSM	10.1504/IJCSM.2015.072965	simulation;computer science	ML	12.102489441888917	-9.04920922885366	194088

Moreover, in order to evaluate security of supply consequences of a new gas infrastructure project, this analysis is performed twice: before and after the infrastructure project. The results of 1 million of Monte-Carlo simulations under the attack scenarios clearly indicate various gas supply consequences.

The majority of existing Pavement Management Systems do not optimize reconstruction jointly with maintenance and rehabilitation policies. We show that not accounting for reconstruction in maintenance and rehabilitation planning results in suboptimal policies for pavements undergoing cumulative damages in the underlying layers (base, sub-base or subgrade). We use a history-dependent pavement deterioration model to account for the influence of MR&R history on the deterioration rate. We present dynamic programming solutions using an augmented state which includes current surface condition and age. The optimal maintenance and resurfacing policies and the optimal time between reconstructions are obtained and graphically represented for a range of real-world pavements.		Jinwoo Lee;Samer M.

We use a fast time ATC simulation of an en-route sector containing multiple flight paths and aircraft types, and into this we inject a serious incident (cabin pressure loss) which forces one aircraft to make an emergency descent. In order to create additional workload for the air traffic controller (ATCo), we also introduce a storm moving across the sector. We measure the associated levels of risk by analyzing the simulation outputs, selecting scenarios on basis of most risk and mutating aircraft entry times to see if the search can discover variant scenarios of even greater risk. The search space is extremely large and cannot be exhaustively searched for the worst case; this is a problem for safety engineers who require a context to search results so that event probabilities can be determined. While providing context cannot demonstrate that the worst case scenario has been found over all input permutations, it can indicate the expected frequency of that result in its near neighborhood, allowing analysts to focus on a much reduced parameter range when investigating those aircraft in conflict.	advanced transportation controller;best, worst and average case;complex systems;simulation;worst-case scenario	Kester Clegg;Robert Alexander	2013		10.1145/2464576.2464669	simulation;engineering;operations management;data mining	ML	12.871210431928883	-8.91585205260313	195151

The improvement factor method is used to evaluate the extent to which repairing components can restore the system reliability. The total maintenance cost and mean system reliability are optimized simultaneously through determining the most appropriate maintenance alternative. A bi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm (BOHGA) is established to optimize the BOIPM model. The BOHGA utilizes a Pareto-based technique to determine and retain the superior chromosomes as the GA chromosome evolutions are performed. Additionally, a unit-cost cumulative reliability expectation measure (UCCREM) is developed to evaluate the extent to which maintaining each individual component benefits the total maintenance cost and system reliability over the operational lifetime. This UCCREM is then incorporated into the genetic algorithm to construct a superior initial chromosome population and thereby enhance its solution efficiency. In order to obtain diverse bi-objective solutions as the Pareto-efficient frontier is approached, the closeness metric and diversity metric are employed to evaluate the superiority of the non-dominated solutions. Accordingly, decision makers can easily determine the most appropriate maintenance alternative. Three simulated cases verify the efficacy and practicality of this approach for determining an imperfect preventive maintenance strategy.	genetic algorithm;memetic algorithm;optimizing compiler;series-parallel graph	Chung-Ho Wang;Sheng-Wang Tsai	2014	J.

In particular, the proposed method bridges the latest information technology and decision-making technique by introducing the recently proposed information technology (i.e., extreme learning machine (ELM)) into the oil purchasing-and-distribution optimization model. Two main steps are involved: market prediction and planning optimization in the proposed model. In market prediction, the ELM technique is employed to provide fast training time and accurate forecasting results for oil prices and demands. In planning optimization, two objectives of general profit maximization and inventory risk minimization are considered; and the most popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), is implemented to search approximate Pareto optimal solutions. For illustration and verification, the motor gasoline market in the US is focused on as the study sample, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed prediction-based optimization approach over its benchmark models (without market prediction and/or planning optimization), in terms of the highest profit and the lowest risk.	algorithm;multi-objective optimization;purchasing	Lean Yu;Zebin Yang;Ling Tang	2016	International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making	10.1142/S0219622016500097	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;meta-optimization;marketing;operations management;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;mathematics;operations research	EDA	14.476486966124222	-4.027342061243717	196414

It is crucial to select target wells and target zones properly, otherwise, the effect of water shutoff may be disturbed. Traditionally, the job to select target wells and target zones is always done artificially and imprecisely, as a result, water shutoff does not perform as good as it can. This paper proposes a fuzzy method capable of optimizing the selection of target wells and target zones for water shutoff. This study plays a significant role in the technique of water shutoff.

Most of the privacy preserving algorithms are focused on the centralized database. The algorithms on the distributed database are very vulnerable to collusion attack. The Privacy-Preserving data mining algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is based on centralized database, and it can be used on the distributed database. The algorithm is divided into two steps in the distributed database. In the first step, the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to get the local Bayesian network structure. The purpose of the second step is getting the global Bayesian network structure by using local ones. In order to protect the data privacy, the secure sum is used in the algorithm. The algorithm is proved to be convergent on theory. Some experiments have been done on the algorithm, and the results prove that the algorithm is feasible.	algorithm;data mining;particle swarm optimization;program optimization	Lei Yang;Jue Wu;Lingxi Peng;Feng Liu	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09339-0_54	multi-swarm optimization;meta-optimization;derivative-free optimization;fsa-red algorithm;metaheuristic	ML	17.12878980455599	-8.633075979962728	198276

We study flexibilities in scheduling that reflect level of preference or attitude of decision-maker towards imprecise concepts, relations between them and fuzzy variables. Special combinations of alternatives or modes allow to take into account these flexibilities and construct exact branch-and-bound scheduling procedure.	schedule (project management)	Margarita Knyazeva;Alexander V.
