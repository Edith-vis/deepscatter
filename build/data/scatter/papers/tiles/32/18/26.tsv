46eb8c1df1a341390e4b1f92a0a76cb651b204a8	near optimal route association with shannon model in multi-drone wsns		"""In this paper, we develop a wireless data gathering model for a multi-drone system in traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where each drone serves as a data collector in the extremely large and densely deployed area. Previous solutions usually consider how to schedule the traveling route among nodes, but fail to optimize the data transmission time. We focus on extending the data collection issue over Shannon model which involves the factors such as the transmission bandwidth and the SNR between a drone and a sensor node. A novel and typical system model is formulated and we investigate the corresponding Route Selection and Communication Association (RSCA) problem, that is, <italic>given a set of candidate flight routes and a fixed number of deployed nodes, we determine which routes should be selected for traveling and which nodes should be associated such that the overall energy consumption for data gathering could be minimized</italic>. We prove the RSCA problem is NP-hard by reduction from the Vertex Cover problem and then devise an efficient and accessible <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$O(\log \log n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> approximation algorithm within the time complexity bound by <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$O(p^{2}\log n\log \log n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the number of sensor nodes and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the number of routes in WSNs. Extensive simulations are carried out to investigate the performance of our designed algorithm by comparing with the brute-force and random methods. The proposed algorithm achieves 54% more energy consumption at most and 45% more on average comparing with the optimal solution. Furthermore, real-world trace-driven evaluations have been conducted to show that our obtained solution would hold 34% more at most and 25% more on average comparing with the optimal energy consumption and eventually validate our algorithm."""	approximation algorithm;brute-force search;np-hardness;sensor node;shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time complexity;unmanned aerial vehicle;vertex cover	Tao Wu;Panlong Yang;Yubo Yan;Ping Li;Xunpeng Rao	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2874661	time complexity;wireless sensor network;approximation algorithm;computer science;vertex cover;data transmission;system model;sensor node;binary logarithm;distributed computing	Embedded	12.402102965777168	79.27416527609209	195063

We consider two objectives: (1) the multipath routing scheme for maximising the energy efficiency with security constraints and (2) the multipath routing scheme for maximising the secrecy capacity. The binary erasure channel model is adopted to describe the wireless channel states among neighbouring nodes. Based on the binary erasure channel model, the problem of multipath routing degrades to a problem of bit allocation for each path. We formulate the problems and find that the problems are both quasi-convex. For the first one, it is a linear fractional optimisation problem. The optimal solution is obtained by the Charnes–Cooper transformation. For the second one, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain the η-optimal solution. The performance analysis shows that the probability of the secure bit allocation increases along with the number of multipaths and decreases along with the number of hops per path and eavesdroppers. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms.

Most existing works on mobile WSNs assume that mobile sinks directly communicate with NCPs via point-to-point links. Consequently, recent advances in cooperative communications, which are more energy-efficient than traditional point-to-point communications, are largely ignored in mobile WSNs. In this paper, we present a novel stochastic NCP selection scheme using cooperative communications. In addition, most existing works assume perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge, which may not be realistic in practice. We only assume inaccurate CSI in this paper. We formulate the problem as a stochastic multi-armed bandit system. This formulation facilitates the distributed architecture due to its “indexibility” characteristic, which dramatically simplifies the computation and implementation of the proposed scheme. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	channel state information;computation;distributed computing;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;multi-armed bandit;point-to-point (telecommunications);queueing theory;relay;selection algorithm;sensor;simulation;stationary process;waypoint	Maoyu Wang;Fei Richard Yu;Louise Lamont;Nan Zhao	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906510	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;telecommunications;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	14.242939721615315	81.0770427230415	195441

d11cc23c33fb282695b34f5b4692a8b07ec86cb7	heuristic solutions for the lifetime problem of wireless sensor networks		In [5, 7, 8] an analytical model of the lifetime problem of wireless sensor networks is developed. The solution given by the model is not practical for WSNs. Each time, there is a change in a sensor network, the solution needs to be recalculated. Also, it is difficult to build ILP solvers inside the small sensors. Furthermore, when the number of sensor nodes and CHs increases, it quickly becomes infeasible to calculate an optimum solution. As the analytical model is not able to be used to solve complicated networks, heuristic solutions are then examined that can compute the solutions for large sensor networks. Finally, the simulation results of the heuristic solutions are presented and discussed.

In order to resolve the problem of low positioning accuracy in WSN, a new positioning algorithm based on virtual beacon nodes is proposed. In this algorithm, the space is divided into several equal areas by anchor nodes; PIT theory is used to estimate the preliminary regional; the best virtual beacon nodes is calculated through the approach degree; finally, an unknown nodes position can be calculated by computing the centroid of the selected anchor nodes. This algorithm adopts the RF signal to locate unknown node.It can not only avoid the overlapped error in a range-based localization algorithm, but also avoid high complexity.	algorithm	Li Ma;Jianpei He;Dongchao Ma	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-54522-1_27	wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	15.901947659318264	75.5108649167681	195876

Since the sleep-wakeup problem is NP-Hard for this model, several heuristics exist. For the model of barrier coverage, however, where sensors are deployed to form an impenetrable barrier for detecting moving objects (a flagship application of wireless sensor networks), design of an optimal sleep-wakeup algorithm is open. In this paper, we solve this open problem by proposing optimal algorithms not only for the often-used case of equal lifetime but also for the much harder case when sensor lifetimes are different. We prove the optimality of both algorithms. Our algorithms can be used to maintain not just barrier coverage but fault tolerant connectivity, as well, while maximizing the network lifetime. We use simulation to show that for random deployments, even when a minimal number of sensors have been deployed, our optimal algorithms can increase the network lifetime by 500% (from 10 weeks to more than a year). Finally, we show that using our optimal algorithms increases the network lifetime six times longer than that achievable using an existing sleep wake-up algorithm called Randomized Independent Sleeping (RIS).	fault tolerance;heuristic (computer science);np-hardness;randomized algorithm;sensor;simulation;software deployment;wake-sleep algorithm	Santosh Kumar;Ten-Hwang Lai;Marc E.

The sensors are deployed to estimate the true values of multiple active target signals. The sensors forward their observation to a fusion center, which processes the observation of each sensor by a set of fusion rules. One achievement of this paper is proposing an unbiased estimator with minimized variance of errors. To do so, we optimize both the power allocation to the sensor nodes and the fusion rules. The optimal solution to the fusion rules are attained analytically, while the power allocation is solved sub-optimally. Finally, our results are reinforced by numerical simulations.	algorithm;computer simulation;numerical analysis;sensor	Ehsan Zandi;Gholamreza Alirezaei;Omid Taghizadeh;Rudolf Mathar	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Wireless for Space and Extreme Environments (WiSEE)	10.1109/WiSEE.2016.7877297	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;soft sensor;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;visual sensor network	Robotics	16.196525066762707	79.54575125931309	196873

Such environments may consist of many inexpensive nodes, each capable of collecting, storing, and processing environmental information, and communicating with neighboring nodes through wireless links. For a sensor network to operate successfully, sensors must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. This issue has been studied in wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a], both of which reach a similar conclusion that coverage can imply connectivity as long as sensors' communication ranges are no less than twice their sensing ranges. In this article, without relying on this strong assumption, we investigate the issue from a different angle and develop several necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring coverage and connectivity of a sensor network. Hence, the results significantly generalize the results in Wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a]. This work is also a significant extension of our earlier work [Huang and Tseng 2003; Huang et al. 2004], which addresses how to determine the level of coverage of a given sensor network but does not consider the network connectivity issue. Our work is the first work allowing an arbitrary relationship between sensing ranges and communication distances of sensor nodes. We develop decentralized solutions for determining, or even adjusting, the levels of coverage and connectivity of a given network. Adjusting levels of coverage and connectivity is necessary when sensors are overly deployed, and we approach this problem by putting sensors to sleep mode and tuning their transmission powers. This results in prolonged network lifetime.	sensor web;sleep mode	Chi-Fu Huang;Yu-Chee Tseng;Hsiao-Lu Wu	2007	TOSN	10.1145/1210669.1210674	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	10.127000162531198	78.7643921709518	196997

There are several definitions of interference in the literature. In a wireless sensor network, the interference at a node may be caused by an edge that is transmitting data [16], or it occurs because the node itself is within the transmission range of another [2], [4], [7]. The interference load of a node is either the number of nodes in the broadcasting disk defined by this node or the number of nodes whose disks cover it [2], [4], [7]. In this paper we show that the problem of assigning power level to a set of nodes in the plane to yield a connected geometric graph whose total node interference is bounded is NP-complete under both definitions. We also introduce some heuristics as well as a simplified version of an O(logn) approximation algorithm in [10] and study their performance through simulation.	approximation algorithm;geometric graph theory;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);np-completeness;simulation;topology control;transmitter	Nhat X.

A novel water-filling algorithm to be performed by the receiver is proposed to solve the problem in a recursive manner. The feasibility and optimality of the proposed solution are analyzed mathematically and verified experimentally. Compared to the conventional Lagrangian-multiplier approach, our algorithm achieves dramatic reduction in computational complexity.	adobe swc file;analysis of algorithms;computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;experiment;lagrange multiplier;lossless compression;quantization (signal processing);recursion;slepian–wolf coding;time complexity;water filling algorithm;weight function	Wei Liu;Lina Dong;Wenjun Zeng	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518209	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	15.965306585118018	80.56496367706153	197665

Cooperative communication represents a potential candidate to improve the energy efficiency of wireless networks and this efficiency can be further improved by considering the variable packet size. In this paper, we address the question of the optimal packet size for data that improves the efficiency of energy consumption in energy constrained wireless cooperative ad hoc networks. Energy efficiency is used as an optimization metric and the problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. The accurate solution of optimal problems is crucial and existing methods proposed for such formulation can still converge to a local solution. In this paper, a novel global optimization approach based on a branch and bound (BB) framework and convexification techniques that address the solution to global optimality known as αBB is introduced. The numerical results show that, this algorithm offers mathematical guarantees for convergence to a point arbitrarily close to the global minimum in reasonable computational time.	algorithm;branch and bound;computation;converge;convex hull;convex optimization;global optimization;hoc (programming language);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;network packet;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;relay;sensor;time complexity	Salah Abdulhadi;Muhammad Ali Naeem;Muhammad Jaseemuddin;Alagan Anpalagan	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649300	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;optimized link state routing protocol;mathematical optimization;mobile ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Robotics	13.20974012436376	80.86724113474355	197668

In this research, a new distributed topology control technique is presented that enhances energy efficiency and reduces radio interference in wireless sensor networks. Each node in the network makes local decisions about its transmission power and the culmination of these local decisions produces a network topology that preserves global connectivity. Central to this topology control technique is the novel Smart Boundary Yao Gabriel Graph (SBYaoGG) and optimizations to ensure that all links in the network are symmetric and energy efficient.

Since sensor selection typically involves a large number of sensors, a low complexity should be maintained for practical applications. We propose a geometry-based sensor selection algorithm that utilizes only the information of sensor locations. In particular, by observing that sensors clustered together tend to have redundant information, we theorize that the redundancy is inversely proportional to the distance between sensors and seek to minimize this redundancy by searching for a set of sensors with the maximum average distance. To further reduce the computational complexity, we perform an iterative sequential search without losing optimality. We apply the proposed algorithm to an acoustic sensor network for source localization, and demonstrate using simulations that the proposed algorithm yields significant improvements in the localization performance with respect to the randomly generated sets of sensors.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computational complexity theory;iterative method;linear search;procedural generation;search algorithm;selection algorithm;sensor;simulation	Yoon Hak Kim	2014	J.

The wireless connections among all the robots must be maintained during their motion. To address this problem, we propose an environmental potential field model which includes a special attractive force determined by the inter-robot distances, in addition to the classical attractive force and the repulsive forces, respectively, defined by the goal and obstacles.

05257898ae3d2fd49c0300f5616c3972f64abcea	genetic algorithm for solving minimal exposure path in mobile sensor networks		The Minimal Exposure Path (MEP) is a fundamental factor to measure quality of service in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The MEP not only improves the performance of WSNs but also guides the action of agents in the sensing field. Up to now, MEP has been focusing on solving problems in stationary sensor networks. MEP with both high dimensionality and non-linear property in stationary WSNs is NP-hard problem. This paper formulated a problem of finding the MEP in Mobile Sensor Networks (MSNs), in which sensors' mobility plays an important role in the execution of application, and then proposed a genetic algorithm to solve it. Our methodology is not only to calculate upper and lower bounds of exposure value, but also to determine the MEP trajectory. The proposed algorithm was experimented on 30 random instances with various numbers of mobile sensors and different velocities of intruder which are proportional to the velocity of sensors. We also compared the minimal exposure value obtained from MSNs model with the one obtained from static sensor network model. Experimental results showed that our genetic algorithm is stable, convergent and effective when applying in both mobile and static models of WSNs.	genetic algorithm;media-embedded processor;np-hardness;network model;nonlinear system;quality of service;sensor;simulation;stationary process;time complexity;trajectory optimization;velocity (software development)	Nguyen Thi My Binh;Chu Minh Thang;Nguyen Duc Nghia;Huynh Thi Thanh Binh	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)	10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285402	wireless sensor network;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;quality of service;curse of dimensionality;trajectory;computer science;exposure value;upper and lower bounds	Mobile	12.084991151927095	78.31779361806268	199268

The dominant factor is the energy for data transmission. Collaborative beamforming can save transmission energy by improving the directivity of electromagnetic waves so that the signal at the receiver is stronger. Compared with a single transmitter, collaborative beamforming spreads the long distance transmission energy over multiple transmitters. This balances the battery lifetime on individual nodes because each transmitter can use lower power. However, beamforming depends on proper coordination of phases among the participating sensor nodes. This requires communication among the sensor nodes and consumes energy. This paper investigates whether the transmission energy can be saved by using beamforming based on the number of nodes and the total size of data needed to transmit. We determine the minimum size of data to balance the communication overhead when given the total number of nodes.	algorithm;beamforming;download;ibm notes;overhead (computing);software propagation;transmitter	Jing Feng;Yung-Hsiang Lu;Byunghoo Jung;Dimitrios Peroulis	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118224	embedded system;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	12.302949523176647	81.29828610059471	199290

Our objective is to devise strategies for scheduling the sensors to optimize the tradeoff between tracking performance and energy consumption. We cast the scheduling problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where the control actions correspond to the set of sensors to activate at each time step. Using a bottom-up approach, we consider different sensing, motion and cost models with increasing levels of difficulty. At the first level, the sensing regions of the different sensors do not overlap and the target is only observed within the sensing range of an active sensor. Then, we consider sensors with overlapping sensing range such that the tracking error, and hence the actions of the different sensors, are tightly coupled. Finally, we consider scenarios wherein the target locations and sensors' observations assume values on continuous spaces. Exact solutions are generally intractable even for the simplest models due to the dimensionality of the information and action spaces. Hence, we devise approximate solution techniques, and in some cases derive lower bounds on the optimal tradeoff curves. The generated scheduling policies, albeit suboptimal, often provide close-to-optimal energy-tracking tradeoffs.	approximation algorithm;bellman equation;bottom-up parsing;coupling (computer programming);markov chain;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;partially observable markov decision process;partially observable system;randomness;scheduling (computing);sensor web;simulation;sparse matrix	George Atia;Venugopal V.
