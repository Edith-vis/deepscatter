f5041c80b7c539c1c45fd1263842db43fde4f77c	energy-aware transmission control for wireless sensor networks powered by ambient energy harvesting: a game-theoretic approach	energy threshold energy aware transmission control model wireless sensor network ambient energy harvesting sensor bayesian game theoretic approach battery powered sensor instantaneous energy state bayesian nash equilibrium bne;game theory;nash equilibrium;bayes methods;telecommunication control;utility function;bayesian methods;energy harvesting;bayesian method;wireless sensor network;wireless sensor networks bayes methods energy harvesting game theory power control telecommunication control;information exchange;games;energy states;bayesian nash equilibrium;predictive models;prediction model;games wireless sensor networks energy states bayesian methods power control predictive models nash equilibrium;private information;wireless sensor networks;bayesian game;power control	We use a Bayesian game-theoretic approach to model transmission control in energy-harvesting wireless sensor networks. In general, the energy state of an energy-harvesting sensor varies more dramatically with time as compared to traditional battery-powered sensors. Therefore, each energy-harvesting sensor is aware of its instantaneous energy state, which is modeled as its private information. Each sensor decides its transmission strategy according to its belief of its opponents' energy states. There exists a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) where a sensor with energy higher than its energy threshold will decide to transmit at fixed power, and wait otherwise. We show how each sensor determines its threshold to maximize its utility function. Moreover, we show via simulations that the performance of the Bayesian game model is close to that of a perfect-information game where energy states are common information to all sensors. In addition, since the proposed Bayesian game has the advantage of requiring less information exchange overhead, it seems to be more feasible to implement than the perfect-information game.	energy level;game theory;information exchange;nash equilibrium;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;sensor;simulation;utility;waits	Fu-Yun Tsuo;Hwee Pink Tan;Yong Huat Chew;Hung-Yu Wei	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962640	bayesian game;game theory;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;bayesian probability;computer science;predictive modelling;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security	Mobile	14.78456070003641	81.90013045092762	194660

Network protocols for the wireless sensor networks such as media access control and routing should be evaluated in terms of life time in a whole system. In fact, there exists power variation node by node due to the manufacturing variation. In the previous researches, however, this effect has not been investigated at all since it has been supposed that all nodes have a same power. In this paper, we develop a power model for a sensor node, in which we consider threshold-voltage variation derived from a manufacturing process. We take both a microprocessor and an RF part into account for the model, and implement it to QualNet in order to evaluate the impact against a life time of a wireless sensor network. The simulation results show that the conventional model has overestimated the life time longer than our model when nodes are randomly deployed. In contrast, if we make an optimum deployment of nodes by exploiting the power variation, the network life time is extended by 12.7% compared to the case of the conventional model.	access control;microprocessor;radio frequency;randomness;routing;sensor node;sensor web;simulation;software deployment	Takashi Matsuda;Takashi Takeuchi;Takefumi Aonishi;Masumi Ichien;Hiroshi Kawaguchi;Chikara Ohta;Masahiko Yoshimoto	2006	2006 First International Conference on Communications and Electronics	10.1587/elex.7.197	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;wireless network;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	12.555287332622935	84.46013792824729	194775

SSs can communicate with the “outside world” only through the BSs. Connection to SSs without a direct (i.e., a single-hop) connection to any BS are established through other SSs serving as wireless repeaters, thereby extending the reach of the BSs. The locations of the SSs and BSs are given by a homogeneous planar Poisson process. We assume a noise limited system supporting a fixed common data rate (could be different for the uplink and the downlink) with power control. All SSs are equipped to transmit the same peak power and have identical receivers, and similarly the BSs. Links requiring higher than the available peak power cannot be activated, and consequently, SSs’ connectivity is not guaranteed. We derive accurate closed form analytic expressions for single-hop connectivity, and lower bounds when multihop is allowed. We calculate the pdf of the transmit power over SS-to-SS and SS-to-BS links, and the mean total transmit energy per data packet for a simple minimal-hop count routing algorithm.	algorithm;cellular architecture;data recovery;downtime;global variable;interference (communication);network packet;portable document format;randomness;rayleigh fading;routing;serial experiments lain;software propagation;sun outage;telecommunications link;uncompressed video;wireless repeater	Sayandev Mukherjee;Dan Avidor;Katherine Hartman	2005	VTC-2005-Fall. 2005 IEEE 62nd Vehicular Technology Conference, 2005.	10.1109/TVT.2007.891428	probability distribution;stochastic process;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;mathematics;statistics;computer network	Mobile	15.757107836326782	88.44600644182917	194881

The proposed system incorporates a fast task reallocation algorithm to quickly recover from possible network service disruptions, such as node or link failures. An evolutional self-learning mechanism based on a genetic algorithm continuously adapts the system parameters in order to meet the desired application delay requirements, while also achieving a sufficiently long network lifetime. Since the algorithm runtime incurs considerable time delay while updating task assignments, we introduce an adaptive window size to limit the delay periods and ensure an up-to-date solution based on node mobility patterns and device processing capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that yields multi-objective task allocation in a mobile multi-hop wireless environment under dynamic conditions. Simulations are performed in various settings, and the results show considerable performance improvement in extending network lifetime compared to heuristic mechanisms. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides noticeable reduction in the frequency of missing application deadlines.	allocation;anatomic node;broadcast delay;computer simulation;genetic algorithm;heuristic;hop;multimedia;network processor;node - plant part;numerous;requirement	Yichao Jin;Serdar Vural;Alexander Gluhak;Klaus Moessner	2013		10.3390/s131013998	embedded system;real-time computing;genetic algorithm;transducer;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	10.984720735974252	83.13798711686071	195700

In this letter, we consider the optimal link addition for a string network in order to minimize the average path length for the network. In prior work, the optimal addition of links to a string network has been found to lead to a network where all the added links are incident to a single anchor node. Furthermore, the position of the anchor node has been found to be fixed at either approximately 0.2 or 0.8 of the total number of nodes in the string network. In this letter, we provide an analytical justification for this observation and, in the process, identify the fixed fractional positions of the anchor nodes. We also discuss the significance of the anchor nodes for a string network, which is an important network model for several real-world communication and social networks.	apl;average path length;grid network;network model;network topology;social network;telecommunications network	Abhishek Chakraborty;S.

Battery lifetime estimation is therefore crucial to evaluate the network behavior over time. In addition, battery lifetime estimation is a major challenge since it depends on many factors, such as the duty cycle of supported applications and the intrinsic chemical reactions within the batteries. Several battery models have been proposed to deal with battery lifetime estimation. However, most of the available models address only high-capacity batteries. This paper discusses a method for extracting the parameters for the Kinetic Battery Model (KiBaM) used within WSN context. The target is to define a battery model that helps to estimate the lifetime of nodes using low-capacity batteries and which operate in a duty cycle scheme. Results show that KiBaM is an adequate model for WSNs since it presents low error when compared with experimental results using real batteries.	discharger;duty cycle;experiment;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;item unique identification;low-power broadcasting;sensor;simulation	Leonardo M.

For this, we examine how typical wireless network parameters such as, network density and environment variables such as the path loss exponent can affect the power assigned to the transmitters and the resulting connectivity between specified nodes. We also present structural properties for the minimum power assignment. We finally examine at what cost malicious jamming nodes can harm the robustness of the network and asses whether the network can mitigate these jamming attempts by only adapting its transmission powers	environment variable;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);malware;radio jamming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter	Anthony Ephremides;Vangelis Angelakis;Apostolos Traganitis	2006	2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2006.254188	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	16.049710019197068	87.78523438649292	198756

Even though a frequency hopping mechanism is employed by BLE to combat fading and interference in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band, a noticeable probability of collision is expected to arise when the number of communicating BLE devices in the same vicinity increases. In this paper, an analytical model to find the selection probability of each of the 37 BLE data channels is presented. The results, which are confirmed by brute-force simulation, are then used to find the probability of collision between collocated BLE pairs and their maximum achievable aggregate throughput.	aggregate data;bluetooth;brute-force search;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;implicit shape model;interference (communication);sensor;simulation;throughput	Mohamad Omar Al Kalaa;Hazem H.

For a collection of simultaneously transmitting stations in the plane, it is possible to identify a reception zone for each station, consisting of the points where its transmission is received correctly. The resulting SINR diagram partitions the plane into a reception zone per station and the remaining plane where no station can be heard.  SINR diagrams appear to be fundamental to understanding the behavior of wireless networks, and may play a key role in the development of suitable algorithms for such networks, analogous perhaps to the role played by Voronoi diagrams in the study of proximity queries and related issues in computational geometry. So far, however, the properties of SINR diagrams have not been studied systematically, and most algorithmic studies in wireless networking rely on simplified graph-based models such as the unit disk graph (UDG) model, which conveniently abstract away interference-related complications, and make it easier to handle algorithmic issues, but consequently fail to capture accurately some important aspects of wireless networks.  The current paper focuses on obtaining some basic understanding of SINR diagrams, their properties and their usability in algorithmic applications. Specifically, based on some algebraic properties of the polynomials defining the reception zones we show that assuming uniform power transmissions, the reception zones are convex and relatively well-rounded. These results are then used to develop an efficient approximation algorithm for a fundamental point location problem in wireless networks.	algebraic equation;approximation algorithm;computation;computational geometry;convex function;interference (communication);point location;polynomial;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;state diagram;transmitter;unit disk graph;usability;voronoi diagram	Chen Avin;Yuval Emek;Erez Kantor;Zvi Lotker;David Peleg;Liam Roditty	2009		10.1145/1582716.1582750	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;computational geometry;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	17.112748627393433	88.02399221718558	199521
