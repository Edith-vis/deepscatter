4525beac261ddd5361f5e0efed2b83857d70ae33	next-generation design and eda challenges: small physics, big systems, and tall tool-chains	big systems;small physics;tall tool-chains;next-generation design;silicon;algorithm design and analysis;finance;lithography;transistors	There is much discussion of two challenges in the design of tomorrow’s electronics: the difficult “small physics” of nanoscale transistors, and the silicon/software complexity of “big systems”. But those of us who want to build beautiful algorithms have an additional hurdle: “tall tool-chains”. If it takes 50 tool-steps to build an industrial-strength design flow, and each tool is based on 1-2 “big algorithms”, does this mean that each new algorithm idea is worth, at best, 1-2% of the success of a design? This seems to me a bad way of accounting for the tremendous value that EDA brings to the world of design. How can we have a big impact in this important technology area? In this talk, I will offer several pieces of advice for how not to get buried by the tall-toolchain problem. I will discuss how to identify design problems that can have large impact, how to embrace the strange physics of tomorrow’s silicon technologies in the service of building beautiful algorithms, and how to get fresh (and unique) insights on problems by spending time working with a real design team. I will use design examples ranging from lithography, to computational finance, to silicon-based speech recognition, to illustrate the point that this is an exciting time to be working on tomorrow’s tool and design challenges.	algorithm;computational finance;programming complexity;speech recognition;toolchain;transistor	Rob A.

5dce3cdfd4d7cbe741a7c9a0a783bfad72cf24c9	high-speed dynamic asynchronous pipeline: self-precharging style	pipelines pipeline processing detectors rails throughput delays protocols;fine grain pipelining asynchronous pipeline dual rail logic dynamic logic;logic design asynchronous circuits;size 90 nm high speed dynamic asynchronous pipeline self precharging pipeline fine grain pipelining gate level pipelining asymmetric c element handshaking signals lookahead dual rail pipeline dual rail logic dynamic logic	This brief proposes a new type of high throughput asynchronous pipeline structure called self-precharging (SP) pipeline. The proposed SP pipeline targets dynamic linear datapaths for fine grain and gate level pipelining. The novel SP protocol and modified structure enables SP pipeline to deliver multi gigahertz throughput without degrading the per-stage forward latency of the pipeline. An asymmetric C (aC) element is used to combine the two control signals, which are used to evaluate and precharge a stage. Because of the aC element, the pipeline is able to remove one of the important timing constraints present in lookahead pipelines (LP). Since the SP signal is coming from the same stage without altering the functionality of the signal, the wiring load of handshaking signals between two stages is maintained minimum. The pipeline is implemented in 90 nm UMC technology and it offers (2.227 giga data items/s) more than twice the throughput of Williams' PS0 and more than 20% improvement over the best lookahead dual rail pipeline (LP2/1). The area and power consumption of the proposed pipeline are comparable with the state-of-the-art asynchronous pipeline topologies.	and gate;handshaking;parsing;pipeline (computing);throughput;wiring	C.

Today, the diameter of the smallest TSV available is around 1 μm, and this is expected to reach sub-micron dimensions in a few years. This downscaling of TSVs requires research on the impact of nano-scale TSVs on the quality of 3D IC designs to provide academia and industry with the quantified effects. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the impact of nano-scale TSVs on the area, wirelength, delay, and power quality of today and future 3D IC designs. For our future process technology, we develop a 22nm standard cell and interconnect library. We also use four sets of TSV-related dimensions in our GDSII-level 3D IC layouts. Based on these resources, we present a thorough study on the impact of nano-scale TSVs on the design quality of today and future 3D ICs.	downscaling;electric power quality;gnu nano;overhead (computing);standard cell;three-dimensional integrated circuit;through-silicon via;via (electronics)	Daehyun Kim;Suyoun Kim;Sung Kyu Lim	2011	International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction	10.1109/SLIP.2011.6135435	nanoelectronics;embedded system;electronic engineering;logic gate;engineering;electrical engineering;through-silicon via;capacitance;integrated circuit layout	EDA	13.096032510506245	56.3959196087896	136361

This paper presents an optimized low-swing interconnect for FPGAs operating in the sub-threshold region. We also address signal degradation along lengthy interconnect paths and examine strategies for inserting low-switching-threshold repeaters. A 130nm test chip implementing low-swing interconnect meshes with different circuit parameters is measured. The results show that optimization of the low-swing interconnect provides up to 60.2% lower energy-delay-product (EDP) than a straightforward, un-optimized low-swing design at VDD = 0.4V. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the optimized low-swing interconnect is 97.7% faster and 42.7% lower energy than a traditional uni-directional interconnect at VDD = 0.4V.	cmos;electronic data processing;elegant degradation;field-programmable gate array;mathematical optimization;network switch;optimizing compiler;routing;simulation;value-driven design	He Qi;Oluseyi A.

Problems with many of these technologies are due to such factors as process variations, defects and impurities in materials and solutions, and noise. Consequently, many systems built from these technologies operate imperfectly. Luckily there are many complex and large-market systems (applications) that tolerate acceptable though not always correct results. In addition, there is emerging a body of mathematical analysis related to imperfect computation. In this paper we first introduce the concepts of acceptable error-tolerance and acceptable performance degradation, and demonstrate how important attributes of these concepts can be quantified. We interlace this discussion with several examples of systems that can effectively employ these two concepts. Next we mention several immerging technologies that motivate the need to study these concepts as well as related mathematical paradigms. Finally we will list a few CAD issues that are needed to support this new form of technological revolution.	british informatics olympiad;cmos;computation;computer-aided design;electron;elegant degradation;image noise;interlaced video;transistor	Melvin A.

However, technology scaling presents several manufacturing and design technology challenges that must be overcome to build semiconductor products in a cost effective manner. While some of the existing challenges that we face today such as power, process variations are expected to become worse at smaller geometries requiring innovations, new problems may arise in integrating heterogeneous technologies such as RF, MEMS on the same die/package. A myriad of design technology challenges starting from functional validation to timing validation and design for test to manufacturability must be addressed to successfully build products. The paper will highlight challenges and identify some of the opportunities in driving design technologies forward.	design for manufacturability;design for testing;image scaling;microelectromechanical systems;moore's law;radio frequency;semiconductor	Greg Spirakis	2004	Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition		electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;integrated circuit;design for testing;design technology;manufacturing engineering	EDA	11.73952801412537	57.08448413639086	137498

db1019fb8c810adc4e37183a662a2c398d5e01a6	from the quantum moore's law toward silicon based universal quantum computing		Forthcoming CMOS technology nodes are in principle sufficient for achieving both the quantum information density and the speed that are critical for error-free logical qubits. Using data from the roadmap for semiconductor devices from ITRS and IEDM, we applied the standard CMOS design rules to a universal set of quantum logic gates to control silicon qubits. We consequently obtain a scaling law for quantum information density for Steane code, concatenated codes, and surface code, which represent the quantum information equivalent of Moore's law in terms of density scaling per node. By imposing the constraints due to both quantum error correction and the intrinsic operation speed limitation of a physical silicon qubit, we determine that technology nodes below 14 nm can in principle support error-free logical qubits manipulated at GHz frequency. We review the current state-of- the-art of silicon technology to assess the performance of different silicon qubit architectures based on CMOS single donors and double quantum dot devices. Our analysis demonstrates that silicon technology is compatible with the scalability requirements imposed by quantum error correction architectures for universal quantum computing. Such considerations provide a benchmark for the development of a silicon-based quantum computer and a general guideline for other quantum technology platforms.	artificial intelligence;benchmark (computing);cmos;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;image scaling;information design;information processing;logic gate;moore's law;quantum computing;quantum dot;quantum error correction;quantum information science;quantum logic;quantum technology;qubit;refinement (computing);requirement;scalability;semiconductor device;steane code;toric code	Enrico Prati;Davide Rotta;Fabio Sebastiano;Edoardo Charbon	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)	10.1109/ICRC.2017.8123662	qubit;quantum technology;quantum error correction;quantum information;steane code;quantum computer;quantum dot;quantum logic;electronic engineering;physics	EDA	12.02713340796206	58.90195453301608	137644

However, the system design and verification methodologies that capture the complexity of multistandard RF SoC's are still limited. In this paper, an HDL design methodology is introduced for multistandard RF SoC's, which covers all the design layers from system design, to automatic extraction of the models from circuits and a systematic top level verification. The offered HDL based design methodology combines top down and bottom up design approaches, and brings the design and verification closer by reflecting the circuits to models automatically via an Automatic Parameter Extraction (APX) tool. System or block level verification is obtained with models automatically by overnight runs, without the need for extra test benches or designer interaction. This enables short term detection of functional errors or performance losses. A first time tape out of a multimode Bluetooth transceiver SoC is designed and fabricated in 8 months by using the offered methodology. The accuracy of the system level simulations show a very good match with the measurement results after fabrication. The test SoC is fabricated with 0.13 μm CMOS technology.	ams-latex;apx;automatic differentiation;bluetooth;cmos;computer-aided design;electronic circuit;expanded memory;hardware description language;mixed-signal integrated circuit;radio frequency;requirement;schematic;simulation;system on a chip;systemc;systemverilog;systems design;tape-out;top-down and bottom-up design;transceiver;transistor;vhdl-ams;verilog-a;wunderlich (vacuum tube)	Aytac Atac;Zhimiao Chen;Lei Liao;Yifan Wang;Martin Schleyer;Ye Zhang;Ralf Wunderlich;Stefan Heinen	2014	2014 51st ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)	10.1145/2593069.2593089	system on a chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;bluetooth	EDA	11.400241829695993	55.234171663124286	137874

It is shown that there is a limit on how ideal an on-chip interconnect can be made independent of the how wide the wire is made. This limit is a function of the height of the interconnect, its length, and some other physical and material constants. It is also shown that it is possible to design a repeater system that results in close to speed of light propagation on narrow nanoscale wires. In addition, wider wires can be used to effectively eliminate the need for repeaters in current technologies.	gnu nano;software propagation	Yehea I.

This article describes and illustrates the use of a new version of the toolset that includes four new features: first, it supports a broad range of single-driver routing architectures, which have superior architectural and electrical properties over the prior multidriver approach (and which is now employed in the majority of FPGAs sold). Second, it can now model, for placement and routing a heterogeneous selection of hard logic blocks. This is a key (but not final) step toward the incluion of blocks such as memory and multipliers. Third, we provide optimized electrical models for a wide range of architectures in different process technologies, including a range of area-delay trade-offs for each single architecture. Finally, to maintain robustness and support future development the release includes a set of regression tests for the software.  To illustrate the use of the new features, we explore several architectural issues: the FPGA area efficiency versus logic block granularity, the effect of single-driver routing, and a simple use of the heterogeneity to explore the impact of hard multipliers on wiring track count.	computer-aided design;field-programmable gate array;image scaling;logic block;place and route;programming tool;regression testing;routing;wiring	Jason Luu;Ian Kuon;Peter Jamieson;Ted Campbell;Andy Ye;Wei Mark Fang;Kenneth B.

OCI (open compression interface) is a standardization of how the necessary data is passed from test logic insertion to pattern generation to diagnosis such that different vendors can be used for each step independent of the on-chip scan compression logic used.

The novelty of this flow lies in the use of a unique wire length distribution called the maximum multiplicity distribution (MMD) to predict individual wire lengths in a logical netlist, which is then later used to drive the placement during physical design. In this paper, it is shown that these wire length predictions can be used to predict the capacitive loads of individual gates with an average error of 6.5%. In addition, this MMD-based length prediction driven placement (LPDP) methodology also results in an average reduction of the number of global interconnects by 32%, the length of global interconnects by 40%, and maximum length of interconnects by 15% when compared with a traditional placement that minimizes total wire length.	electrical connection;mikumikudance;netlist;physical design (electronics);very-large-scale integration	Pranav Anbalagan;Jeffrey A.

In the design of the leaf level mesh, the density of the mesh at various parts of the chip is a crucial factor which decides the clock skew and power dissipated in the mesh. We propose a capacitance driven mesh formation methodology which forms a minimum wire length, non-uniform mesh when compared to the traditional skewdriven mesh. After connecting the sinks to the mesh by a combination of Steiner tree and stubs, appropriately sized buffers are placed at optimal locations such that skew and power dissipation are minimized. When our algorithms were tested on ISPD2010 benchmarks, the power dissipated in the mesh was found to be 25% lesser and the skew was 32% to 45% lesser than the skew driven mesh.	algorithm;cpu power dissipation;clock skew;mesh networking;mike lesser;norm (social);steiner tree problem	John Reuben;V.

Several studies have investigated how to minimize the number of TSVs in 3D ICs, but not much focus on the total wire-length of circuit. However, with the scaling trend of CMOS technology, the power consumption due to routing resources is much higher than the other resources. In this paper, we propose a novel method of simultaneous layer-aware and region-aware partitioning (SLARAP), basing on hMetis, to reduce the number of TSVs and shorten the total wire-length of circuits simultaneously. The gigascale systems research center (GSRC) benchmarks are used as test circuits in our experiments. The experimental results show that our approach works efficiently and it can effectively reduce the total wire-length compared to iLap while considering the TSV number minimization.	algorithm;cmos;experiment;image scaling;integrated circuit design;mathematical optimization;routing;run-length encoding;stacking;systems theory;three-dimensional integrated circuit;through-silicon via	Yung-Hao Lai;Yang-Lang Chang;Jyh-Perng Fang;Jie Lee	2016	2016 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS)	10.1109/APCCAS.2016.7804014	embedded system;benchmark;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	14.65538925963398	53.47085747849818	139846

To reduce the adder's delay and power consumption, the adder is divided into variable-sized blocks that balance the inputs to the carry chain. The optimum block sizes for minimizing the critical path delay with complementary carry generation are achieved. Within blocks, highly optimized carry look-ahead logic, which computes block generate and block propagate signals, is used to further decrease delay. The adder architecture decreases power consumption by reducing the number of logic levels, glitches, and transistors. To achieve balanced delay, input bits are grouped unevenly in the carry chain. This grouping reduces active power by minimizing extraneous glitches and transitions. The adder has been implemented in 130nm CMOS technology. At 1.2V and 25C, typical performance is 1.086GHz and power dissipation normalized to 600 MHz operation is 0.786 mW.	32-bit;adder (electronics);cmos;cpu power dissipation;carry-skip adder;critical path method;glitch;low-power broadcasting;transistor	Kai Chirca;Michael J.

It has been researched and developed in the last decade, with researchers providing better architectural designs which address the technology's main challenges—its limited write endurance, potential long latency, high energy writes, power dissipation, and some concerns for memory privacy. Some physical properties of the technology are also discussed, providing a basis for architectural discussions. Also briefly shown are other architectural alternatives, such as FeRAM and MRAM. The designs surveyed in this article include read before write, wear leveling, write cancellation, write pausing, some encryption schemes, and buffer organizations. These allow PCM to stand on its own as a replacement for DRAM as main memory. Designs for hybrid memory systems with both PCM and DRAM are also shown and some designs for SSDs incorporating PCM.	adobe flash;cpu power dissipation;computer data storage;dynamic random-access memory;encryption;ferroelectric ram;magnetoresistive random-access memory;nonvolatile bios memory;phase-change memory;wear leveling	Omer Zilberberg;Shlomo Weiss;Sivan Toledo	2013	ACM Comput.

Test circuitry area overhead and yield loss are weighed against the benefits of reduced I/O (input/output) area and improved wafer testability. Where the area overhead of a complete 1149.1 interface is not justifiable for small cells, a simple scan interface which still allows for compliance with the 1149.1 standard at the full wafer system level is proposed. It is shown that the additional test area required may be more than compensated for by the savings in I/O probe pad area. Through a yield analysis driven by the relative areas of the constituent cells, the authors provide a systematic framework for the process of placing 1149.1 test capabilities within a monolithic wafer-scale-system design. >	boundary scan;jtag;wafer-scale integration	David L.

At the crossroad of multiple technological trends, 3D IC, optical network on chip (ONOC) and further downscale in traditional 2D semiconductor, this paper proposes hybrid NOC synthesis as a way to exploit respective technological advances as they emerge. Rather than consider design as a static view of design parameters, hybrid Network on Chip (NoC) synthesis generates a hybrid NOC under the assumption of 3D and optical network while capturing latest technological advances exposed by components libraries and EDA tools. This will be explained through MHYNESYS II, a Multi-stages Hybrid Optical-electronics Network on Chip Synthesis for Next Generation 3D IC Manycore.	central processing unit;downscaling;library (computing);manycore processor;multi-core processor;network on a chip;next-generation network;optical network on chip;scalability;semiconductor;three-dimensional integrated circuit	Omar Hammami;Khawla Hamwi	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)	10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6571847	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;electronic design automation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;network operations center;network on a chip;optical switch;bandwidth;integrated circuit design	EDA	12.594209368555083	56.422812975649826	141310

Neuronal communications are implemented by biological wiring, which draw on limited resources such as space, time and energy. This suggests that evolution must have solved VLSI-design-like problems. We analyzed multiple features of brain architectures and found that they could be explained as solutions to optimal design problems. We found examples of optimization in component placement, branched routing, overcoming wiring congestion, and interconnect width variation. Such approach leads to a systematic view of the brain architecture, which should help understand brain function.	component placement;mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimal design;routing;very-large-scale integration;wiring	Dmitri B.

The use of Partially Programmable Circuits (PPCs) has been recently proposed for yield enhancement with very small overhead. This new circuit structure is obtained from conventional logic by replacing some subcircuits with programmable LUTs. The present paper lays the theoretical groundwork for evaluating PPCs with Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) satisfiability. First, QBF models are constructed to calculate the fault tolerance and design error tolerance of a PPC, namely the percentages of faults and design errors that can be masked using LUT reconfigurations. Next, zero-cost Engineering Change Order (ECO) in PPCs is investigated. QBF formulations are given for performing ECOs, and for quantifying the ECO coverage of a PPC architecture. Experimental results are presented evaluating PPCs from [1], demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed formulations.	engineering change order;error-tolerant design;fault tolerance;overhead (computing);reconfigurability;true quantified boolean formula;very-large-scale integration;ecos	Hratch Mangassarian;Hiroaki Yoshida;Andreas G.

Fast-Write SCM (W-SCM) achieves the fast write, while Fast-Read SCM (R-SCM) realizes the fast read. By the mix & match of two SCMs with asymmetric write/read latency, the performance of W-SCM/R-SCM/NAND flash hybrid SSD is improved by 86% compared with a conventional SCM/NAND flash hybrid S SD. The data management techniques for effectively controlling three types of memories, W-SCM, R-SCM and NAND flash, are implemented in the SSD controller. By changing the ECC strength and the maximum set/reset verify cycles of SCMs by the SSD controller, W-SCM and R-SCM are realized without changing circuits of SCMs.	c syntax;flash memory controller;solid-state drive	Yutaka Adachi;Chihiro Matsui;Ken Takeuchi	2018	2018 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)	10.1109/VLSI-DAT.2018.8373247	control theory;computer science;bit error rate;latency (engineering);electronic engineering;parallel computing;electronic circuit;decoding methods;nand gate	Arch	16.865561422809776	60.18789530898483	143460

Invited Abstract Mani Soma University of Washington Is it possible to create analog fault models that are theoretically valid, experimentally verifiable, and computationally ef icient to support test developments and quality improvements? This presentation challenges the audience to face this question heads-on, given the variety of analog fault models in use in the past twenty years. We will review various efforts, from those relying on mapping manufacturing defects to devices and circuits to others relying on process variations, block-level parametric variations, and circuit-level specification variations. While the impediments to the development of a standard analog fault model are obvious, the procedures to create such a model have never been elucidated, always left as future work to be done later. Well, the future is now. The presentation, with audience participation, seeks to outline possible procedures to solve this problem defined in the past yet still continuing to affect current and future technologies.

56e728ebc1561f2e0cd4a240bad96eae0f3903af	gph: a group-based partitioning scheme for reducing total power consumption of parallel buses	power saving;partitioning;pso;total power;particle swarm optimizer;parallel bus;partitioned encoding;power dissipation;power reduction;coupling power	Two main sources for power dissipation in parallel buses are data transitions on each wire and coupling between adjacent wires. So far, many techniques have been proposed for reducing the self and coupling powers. Most of these methods utilize one (or more) control bit(s) to manage the behavior of data transitions on the parallel bus. In this paper, we propose a new coding scheme, referred to as GPH, to reduce power dissipation of these control bits. GPH coding scheme employs partitioned Bus Invert and Odd Even Bus-Invert coding techniques. This method benefits from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to efficiently partition the bus. In order to reduce self and coupling powers of the control bits, it finds partitions with similar transition behaviors and groups them together. One extra control bit is added to each group of partitions. Properly managing number of transitions on control bits of each partition and that of each group, GPH reduces total power consumption, including coupling power. It also locates control bits of each partition such that total power consumption is minimized. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method for coding data and address buses under various hardware platforms. Experimental results show 43% average power saving in coded data compared to the original one. We also show the prominence of our coding scheme over previously proposed techniques.

This paper employs an algorithm that searches the critical path of the logical circuit. Then, by embedding with the level converter into the original logic circuit, the proposed design can supply the lower supply voltage to circuits which are not resided on the critical path. Hence, the overall power consumption can be reduced. This paper uses the static and statistical approaches to perform the timing analysis. It can search the path sensitivity which equals to the probability of a critical path in the logic circuit. Finally, the logic gate with the proposed cell can replace the standard cell through cell-based design approach. The simulated power consumption on the ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits shows that the proposed design can reduce an average of 39% power reduction with an average of 18% delay overhead. Hence, the overall power delay product still outperform the original cell design over 25%.	benchmark (computing);critical path method;design flow (eda);embedded system;full custom;logic gate;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);search algorithm;standard cell;statistical static timing analysis	Ko-Chi Kuo;Hsueh-Ta Ko	2012	2012 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems	10.1109/ISPACS.2012.6473600	electronic engineering;real-time computing;logic optimization;asynchronous circuit;delay calculation;logic gate;logic family;computer science;electrical engineering;pass transistor logic;sequential logic;pull-up resistor;digital electronics;static timing analysis;power optimization;register-transfer level;low-power electronics;emitter-coupled logic	EDA	16.966195893684347	55.1202427747386	144678

142aaacafc6b3f7adc52c158789db41c0b9324fc	yield analysis and optimization		ion of manufacturing constraints into a set geometric of constraints or design rules for the layout designers to follow have traditionally been foundry’s main method to ensure high probability of correct fabrication of integrated circuits. Typical design rules are constraints on width, spacing or pattern density. Origins of design rules lie various manufacturing steps such as lithography, etch, implant, CMP, etc. Other factors influencing design rule values include preserving scaling, area overhead, layout migratability 7 and ability of design tools and flows to handle them. Manufacturability implications of technology scaling have led to three major trends in design rules: • More complicated rule sets. The sheer number of design rules has been growing at a rapid pace with every technology generation. More process constraints have required Automatic migration of layouts from one technology generation to next is an important concern, especially for custom layouts.	automatic control;debian;design for manufacturability;image scaling;integrated circuit;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);physical design (electronics);software bug	Puneet Gupta;Evanthia Papadopoulou	2008		10.1201/9781420013481.ch37	reliability engineering;pace;lithography;integrated circuit;scaling;fabrication;design for manufacturability;computer science	EDA	13.429568614180756	55.262528921701744	145393

This motivates a novel approach to compressed system-on-a-chip testing based on time-multiplexing the tester channels. It is shown how the introduction of a few control channels will enable the sharing of data channels, on which compressed seeds are passed to every embedded core. Through the use of modular and scalable hardware for on-chip test control and test data decompression, we define a new algorithmic framework for test data compression that is applicable to system-on-a-chip devices comprising intellectual property-protected blocks.	add-ons for firefox;cluster analysis;compressed sensing;data compression;embedded system;fault coverage;image scaling;multiplexing;olap cube;scalability;system on a chip;test data	Adam B.

465f81a6db51e51f0a03f9e07c8debb492dea85a	design and implementation of 8-bit vedic multiplier using mgdi technique		The main constraints in recent trends of VLSI technology are power, area and delay. CMOS designs occupy more area and dissipate more power. Power dissipation results in heating up of an IC which directly affects the reliability and performance. Multipliers are the integral part of major application systems like Microprocessor, Digital Signal Processor (DSP) etc., so it is necessary to optimize the multiplier unit to build an efficient processor. In this paper, 8-bit Vedic multiplier is proposed using modified Gate Diffusion Input (mGDI). 8-bit Vedic multiplier is designed using Urdhva Tiryagbhyam sutra with 4 numbers of 4-bit Vedic multiplier and 3 adder circuits. The proposed mGDI based multiplier consumes 66% less area, 76.1% less power and 60% less delay when compared to conventional CMOS design.

However, the increasing cost of testing becomes a big burden in manufacturing a highly integrated SoC. In this paper, an efficiently testable design technique is introduced for an SoC with an on/off-chip bus bridge for the on-chip advanced high-performance bus and off-chip peripheral-component-interconnect bus. The bridge is exploited by maximally reusing the bridge function to achieve efficient functional and structural testing. The testing time can be significantly reduced by increasing the number of test channels and shortening the test-control protocols. Experimental results show that area overhead and testing times are considerably reduced in both functional- and structural-test modes. The proposed technique can be extended to the other types of on/off-chip bus bridges.

30a42c42dd7872fa7b7653782ea3e05e2e37474e	library optimization for near-threshold voltage design		A circuit operating at near-threshold voltage (NTV) dissipates much less energy, but it suffers from significant increase in cell delay as well as delay variation. In this paper, we address two library optimization methods for NTV design: (1) transistor lengths are increased to benefit from reverse short channel effect (RSCE), and (2) each flip-flop is optimized into a few versions with different timing parameters by redistributing clock signals to clocked transistors. Flip-flops are remapped to optimized ones via integer linear programming (ILP); a goal is to minimize total negative slack (TNS) under hold time constraints, which is a critical concern in NTV design. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves 22%, 56%, and 13% reductions in clock period, energy dissipation, and circuit area, respectively, on average of a few test circuits in 55-nm technology.	clock rate;flops;flip-flop (electronics);integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;slack variable;standard cell;transistor	Daijoon Hyun;Jaewoo Seo;Youngsoo Shin	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351311	electronic engineering;control theory;voltage;electronic circuit;transistor;threshold voltage;computer science;integer programming;dissipation;reverse short-channel effect	EDA	16.78788947814667	54.76224967164239	146745

Owing to the power consumption of ICs is not only decided by the switching activity of each gate but also depended on the gate types in the target library, the major difference between our algorithm and the traditional methods is that we consider the power consumption of gate with different type. Besides, by the usage of inverter relocation based on the Demorgan’s law, we can further reduce the IC’s total power consumption. Under the cases of different probabilities of input signals switching rate are applied, experimental results show that our approach can further reduce up to 12.7% average power consumption than the case applied ExDecomp /HeuDecomp algorithm[14].	algorithm;library (computing);logic synthesis;power inverter;relocation (computing)	Chih-Hung Lee;Yu-Chung Lin;Hsin-Hsiung Huang;Tsai-Ming Hsieh	2002		10.1109/ISQED.2002.996789	control engineering;functional decomposition;embedded system;electronic engineering;logic synthesis;electronic design automation;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;probability;capacitance;decomposition;logic;statistics;integrated circuit design	EDA	16.727258829236277	54.969552726041194	147927

In this paper, a 9T-based read-half-select disturb-free SRAM architecture with the cross-point data-aware write strategy is proposed. Based on the proposed write-half-select and read-half-select disturb-free strategy, our 9T bitcell structure improves the read and write SNM by 2.5X and 2.4X compared to traditional bitcells. Furthermore, the proposed strategy and 9T bitcell structure can reduce the read power dissipation on bitline of the SRAM array by 5.14X compared with traditional SRAMs. Based on the proposed architecture, a 16Kb SRAM is fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS which is fully functional from 1.2 V down to 0.33 V. The minimal energy per cycle is 11.8pJ at 0.35 V. The power consumption at 0.33 V is 2.5 μW with 175 kHz.

Even though the test cost for such mixed-signal SOCs is significantly higher than that for digital SOCs, most prior research in this area has focused exclusively on digital cores. We propose a low-cost test development methodology for mixed-signal SOCs that allows the analog and digital cores to be tested in a unified manner, thereby minimizing the overall test cost. The analog cores in the SOC are wrapped such that they can be accessed using a digital test access mechanism (TAM). We evaluate the impact of the use of analog test wrappers on area overhead and test time. To reduce area overhead, we present an analog test wrapper optimization technique, which is then combined with TAM optimization in a cost-oriented heuristic approach for test scheduling. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using analog wrappers by presenting transistor-level simulations for an analog wrapper and a representative core. We present experimental results for three SOCs from the ITC '02 test benchmarks that have been augmented with three analog cores: an I-Q transmit path pair and an audio CODEC path used in cellular phone applications.	baseline (configuration management);codec;cost efficiency;embedded system;heuristic;hoc (programming language);ibm tivoli access manager;mathematical optimization;mixed-signal integrated circuit;mobile app;mobile phone;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;system on a chip;test plan;transistor	Anuja Sehgal;Sule Ozev;Krishnendu Chakrabarty	2006	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2006.871758	system on a chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;electronic design automation;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system	EDA	11.946941481591358	53.783551118901556	148661

In this paper we show how new relay circuit design techniques combined with those we already demonstrated on smaller relay blocks enable us to optimize the design of the most complex arithmetic unit, the floating-point unit (FPU). The energy, performance, and area trade-offs of FPU designs with NEM relays are examined and compared with those of state-of-the-art CMOS designs in an equivalent scaled process. Circuits that are critical path bottlenecks for the FPU specifically, most notably the leading zero detector (LZD) and leading zero anticipator (LZA), are optimized with new relay-tailored circuit techniques. These optimizations reduce the NEM relay FPU latency from 71 mechanical delays in an optimal-CMOS-style implementation to 16 mechanical delays in a generalized custom NEM relay implementation. In a 90nm process node, the FPU designed with NEM relays is projected to achieve 15× lower energy per operation compared to the FPU designed with CMOS.	cmos;circuit design;critical path method;fma instruction set;floating-point unit;gnu nano;leading zero;nem (cryptocurrency);relay;scalability;spectral leakage;very-large-scale integration	Sumit Dutta;Vladimir Stojanovic	2014	2014 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)	10.1145/2770287.2770323	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	Arch	16.14505325463697	57.78982888136175	150064

HA2TSD ensures that the total slack budget is maximal and the total power is near-minimal. Based on these time slacks, we have optimized technology parameters (supply voltage, threshold voltage, and device width) through a gate-level power optimizer and have tested the algorithm on a set of benchmark example circuits and building blocks of a synthesizable ARM core. The experimental results show that our strategy delivers over an order of magnitude savings in total (static and dynamic) power and reduces the optimization run-time significantly.	arm architecture;algorithm;benchmark (computing);cmos;logic gate;mathematical optimization;maximal set;power optimizer;slack variable;very-large-scale integration	Kyu-won Choi;Abhijit Chatterjee	2002		10.1145/566408.566459	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;very-large-scale integration	EDA	16.749951968612567	54.97754308491489	151521

However, two major trends have made analog and digital circuits mix and co-exist. First, high-performance analog circuits use digital parts and vice versa. Second, the desire for new features, ease of use and reducing integration costs brings together more digital, analog and RF circuits in one die. This convergence of circuits creates a significant need for analog and digital layout tools to also unify. The first such solution the EDA industry provides is Magma's Titan design platform [1].

The primary objective for concurrent SOC test is to reduce test application time. The methodology used in this paper is not limited to any specific Test Access Mechanism (TAM). Additionally, it can also be applied for test budgeting during the design phase to obtain a tradeoff between test application time and SOC pins needed. In this paper, the above problem is formulated as a well-known 2dimensional bin-packing problem.

We propose a heuristic algorithm to seek for better shapes for the patterns targeting at minimizing Ron and at balancing the current distribution. In order to speed up the analysis, the equivalent resistance network of the driver is modified by inserting ideal switches to keep the conductance matrix constant. Simulation on two drivers from industrial TEG data demonstrates that our algorithm can reduce Ron effectively by shaping metals appropriately within a given routing area.	algorithm;conductance (graph);experiment;heuristic (computer science);industrial pc;network switch;noise shaping;norm (social);routing;shape optimization;simulation	Bo Yang;Shigetoshi Nakatake;Hiroshi Murata	2008	9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)	10.1109/ISQED.2008.98	heuristic;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;shape optimization;resistance;engineering drawing	Arch	15.940691726923676	53.43050662215077	153232

Adders are a crucial portion of all floating-point units, since they form the base element of all arithmetic functions. The 4-to-2 circuits reported previously do not meet the requirements of the next generation of processors. The adder presented here is built using a dynamic circuit style that improves performance significantly. Further a latching element after each dynamic evaluation node controls the power of the dynamic circuits. In this paper we project some of the salient features of the LSDL circuit family by comparing this 4-2 circuit with the most similar static implementation. Use of the LSDL circuit family displays significant improvement not only in terms of performance but also with respect to power dissipation, leakage and area.	adder (electronics);carry-lookahead adder;carry-save adder;central processing unit;dynamic circuit network;next-generation network;requirement;spectral leakage	Ramyanshu Datta;Jacob A.

Currently, the incorporation of these devices into CMOS technologies (RTD-CMOS) is an area of active research. Although some works have focused the evaluation of the advantages of this incorporation, additional work in this direction is required. This paper compares RTD-CMOS and pure CMOS realizations of a set of logic gates which can be operated in a gate-level nanopipelined fashion, thus allows estimating logic networks operating frequency.

One major aspect of the existing works is that handling of these issues at the package and at the chip levels are addressed in two separate phases by two separate groups. Considering the package-chip co-design reality for very high performance integrated circuits in future, it is more effective to tackle all these issues together in one working phase rather than trying to resolve each at a time. This ensures more efficient design by providing options to trade off noise tolerance, number and location of decoupling capacitors, silicon resource used by decoupling, and design limitations for power bus modeling. This paper attempts to identify the common issues that need to be resolved at both package and chip level. It also points out where the existing technology stands, what are the challenges and limitations of existing methodologies and techniques, and what are the options to improve the efficiency of analysis and handling of power supply noise at both levels	coupling (computer programming);integrated circuit;power supply	Pervez Khaled;Masud H.

In this perspective, the introduction of an embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) to store the microcontroller code has become important to enable software customization. In this paper, a 32 KB embedded Phase Change Memory (ePCM) designed and manufactured in 0.11 μm Smart Power BCD technology with a specifically optimized Ge-rich Ge-Sb-Te alloy (supply voltage = 1.8 V) is presented. The ePCM features 18 ns random access time and robustness against resistance drift thanks to the used differential sensing scheme and 20 ßs word modify time with 32-cell programming parallelism thanks to enhanced programming circuits.

We present a method to overcome these difficulties and to implement a 6-b MLC device with a manganite-based RS device. This is done by precisely setting the remnant resistance of the RS device to an arbitrary value. Our MLC system demonstrates that transition metal oxide nonvolatile memory devices may compete with currently available MLCs.	cell (microprocessor);memory cell (binary);multi-level cell;non-volatile memory;resistive random-access memory	P.

A first technique attacks dynamic power by placing unused conductors, adjacent to used conductors, into a high-impedance state, reducing the effective capacitance seen by used conductors. A second technique, charge recycling, re-purposes unused conductors as charge reservoirs to reduce the supply current drawn for a positive transition on a used conductor. A third approach reduces leakage current in interconnect buffers by pulse-based signalling, allowing a driving buffer to be placed into a high impedance stage after a logic transition. All three techniques require CAD support in the routing stage to encourage specific positionings of unused conductors relative to used conductors.	characteristic impedance;computer recycling;computer-aided design;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;high impedance;power optimization (eda);routing;spectral leakage	Safeen Huda;Jason Helge Anderson	2016		10.1145/2872334.2872341	physical design;embedded system;routing;computer science;field-programmable gate array	EDA	15.863002665723831	55.86283737896	157038

It targets to reduce the clock network size and thus the clock power consumption while controlling the switching power of the nets connected to the FFs by selectively merging FFs into multibit FFs and relocating them under timing and placement density constraints. The experimental results are very encouraging. For a set of benchmarks, our approach reduced the switching capacitance of clock network by 36%-43% after gated clock tree synthesis. Finally, the total switching capacitance of clock network and nets connected to the FFs is reduced by 24%-29%.	flip-flop (electronics);relocation (computing)	Shao-Huan Wang;Yu-Yi Liang;Tien-Yu Kuo;Wai-Kei Mak	2012	IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2011.2177460	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;logic gate;computer science;engineering;timing failure;clock gating;cpu multiplier	EDA	16.580939937133326	54.87572871685892	157072

It enables also the partitioning of large SOC designs into a stack with two or more dies. If the resulting 3D-System is optimized, its costs can be smaller than the costs for the manufacturing of the corresponding 2D-System. In this paper a new layout dependent synthesis method for manufacturing costs optimized 3D integrated systems is introduced. As its major part a 3D synthesis optimization method algorithm which used layout information from a floorplanner is presented.

The architecture enables each RRAM switching element to be used both as a memory bit and a temperature sensor. The TSRRAM is integrated into an Alpha 21364 processor as an L2 cache. Its accuracy and performance were simulated using a customized simulation framework. SPEC2000 benchmarks were used to generate thermal profiles in the Alpha processor core. Active and passive sensing mechanisms are also introduced as means for DTM algorithms to determine the thermal profile of the RRAM switching layer. The proposed architecture yielded a 2.14 K mean absolute temperature error during passive sensing, which is well within the useful range of dynamic thermal management (DTM) algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed design is shown to have only an 8 cycle performance overhead.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cmos;cpu cache;canonical account;central processing unit;crossbar switch;electron;ionic;memristor;multi-core processor;overhead (computing);random access;resistive random-access memory;simulation;thermal management of high-power leds;thermal profiling;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Cory E.

Due to limited spare cells in metal-only ECO, the new added netlist may often violate the input-slew and outputloading constraints and, in turn, delay or even fail the timing closure. This paper proposes a framework, named MOESS, to solve the input-slew and output-loading violations by connecting spare cells onto the violated nets as buffers. MOESS provides two buffer insertion schemes performed sequentially to minimize the number of inserted buffers and then to solve timing violations if there is any. This framework has been silicon-validated through industrial designs with more than 1-million instances. The experimental results demonstrate that MOESS can solve more violations with less inserted buffers and less CPU runtime compared to an EDA vendor's solution. The whole framework is built based on a commercial APR tool and can be ported to any other APR tool offering open access to its design database.	apache portable runtime;central processing unit;continuous design;netlist;solver;timing closure	Chien Pang Lu;Mango Chia-Tso Chao;Chen Hsing Lo;Chih-Wei Chang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1145/1514932.1514974	real-time computing	EDA	16.029763866691894	53.49440249377442	163676

In this paper, we propose to reuse these precious TAM resources for real-time debug data transfer in post-silicon validation. This strategy significantly increases debug bandwidth with negligible routing overhead. To support different TAM architectures and debug scenarios, design for debug (DfD) structures are introduced at both core test wrapper level and system level. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach at low DfD cost.	debug;debugger;embedded system;ibm tivoli access manager;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);real-time transcription;requirement;resultant;routing;simulation;test data	Xiao Liu;Qiang Xu	2008	2008 17th Asian Test Symposium	10.1109/ATS.2008.83	system on a chip;embedded system;computer architecture;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;background debug mode interface	EDA	10.972946377416172	53.76345337764487	163752

Inspired by the low-voltage swing (LVS) logic, CMDL uses a shunt resistor at the differential output to obtain constant low swing signal without the need to reset low. Furthermore, conditional shunt transistors are used for the internal nodes to prevent high-voltage swing, thus entirely eliminate the power-hungry clocked reset network in LVS circuits. We show that the CMDL is suitable for high-end microprocessor integer core by providing three datapath modules implemented in CMDL. Our simulation results indicate that, operating at comparable speed with LVS logic, CMDL circuits can achieve up to 50% reduction of delay-power product compared to CMOS logic and LVS logic. In addition, CMDL reduces the power consumption of LVS by up to 40%.	cmos;clock rate;datapath;linux virtual server;microprocessor;monomial;simulation;transistor	Ling Zhang;Jianhua Liu;Haikun Zhu;Chung-Kuan Cheng;Masanori Hashimoto	2008	2008 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference		resistor;embedded system;shunt;electronic engineering;logic synthesis;real-time computing;voltage;logic gate;network switch;computer science;high voltage;electrical engineering;frequency;low voltage;cmos;low-power electronics	EDA	16.99853281079352	57.581641493594354	164489
d2f6cfb2c36d462dcbc45b5f2a26a1845a5e6332	low power high performance finfet standard cells based on mixed back biasing technology		With the decrease in transistor feature size, power consumption, especially leakage power, has become a most important design concern. Because of their superior electrical properties and design flexibility, fin-type field-effect transistors (FinFETs) seem to be the most promising option in low-power applications. In order to support the VLSI digital system design flow based on logic synthesis, this paper proposes a design method for low-power high-performance standard cells based on IG-mode FinFETs. Such a method is derived on the basis of appropriately and artfully designing and optimizing the stacked structures in each standard cell, and applying the mixed forward and reverse back-gate bias technique in a well-chosen manner. The proposed method is also applicable when the supply voltage reduces to 0.5V to further reduce the leakage power consumption. By applying this design method, optimized IG-mode FinFET standard cells are generated, and they form a low-power high-performance standard cell library. Simulation results of the library cells indicate that the performance of the standard cells designed with the proposed method can be maintained while reducing leakage consumption by a factor of 58.9 at most. The 16-bit ripple carry adder implemented with this library can acquire up to 17.5% leakage power reduction.

The ALCDL can implement a complex function in a single gate and achieve high operation speed without DC power dissipation. New CMOS differential latches, which can be used to prevent extra transitions and reduce the power dissipation, are also proposed. A new clocking scheme is designed by locally using the ALCDL circuits and the entire system is synchronized to a single global clock. As compared to the conventional true-single-phase clock system, the loading of the global clock line and transient noise induced by precharge operation can be largely reduced.

For sure, analog designers are in shorter supply, but this only makes the need for improvements and efficiency that much greater. Only of late have we seen production-worth attempts at functions such as analog synthesis and optimization reach the market. What is needed in today's analog design flow? What are the key technologies that are missing? How does the existing “food chain” need to work together to drive greater efficiencies?

Different logic functions can be implemented by reconfiguring the weights and threshold of the same TLG circuit. This paper introduces a novel design of reconfigurable Spintronic Threshold Logic Gate (STLG), which employs spintronic weight devices to perform current-mode weighted summation of binary inputs, whereas, the low voltage fast switching spintronic threshold device carries out the threshold operation in an energy efficient manner. The proposed STLG operates at a small terminal voltage of 50 mV, resulting in ultra-low energy consumption. A bottom-up cross-layer simulation framework is developed to synthesize and map large scale digital logic functions to the proposed STLG circuits. The simulation results of ISCAS-85 benchmarks show that the proposed STLG based reconfigurable logic hardware can achieve two orders lower Energy-Delay Product (EDP) compared with state-of-the-art CMOS Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and smaller EDP compared to large scale Memristive Threshold Logic (MTL) based FPGA. Moreover, the ultra-low programming energy of spintronic weight device also leads to three orders lower reconfiguration energy of STLG compared to MTL design.	boolean algebra;cmos;electronic data processing;field-programmable gate array;logic gate;pipeline (computing);reconfigurable computing;simulation;spintronics;thesaurus linguae graecae;thyristor	Zhezhi He;Deliang Fan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing	10.1109/TETC.2016.2633966	computer science;superconducting logic	EDA	15.865949988922658	59.03620992880026	166705

Because interconnect power is dominant in FPGAs, we design Vdd-programmable interconnect fabric to reduce FPGA interconnect power. There are three Vdd states for interconnect switches: high Vdd, low Vdd and power-gating. We develop a simple design flow to apply high Vdd to critical paths and low Vdd to non-critical paths and to power gate unused interconnect switches. We carry out a highly quantitative study by placing and routing benchmark circuits in 100 nm technology to illustrate the power saving. Compared to single-Vdd FPGAs with optimized but nonprogrammable Vdd level for the same target clock frequency, our new FPGA fabric on average reduces interconnect power by 56.51% and total FPGA power by 50.55%. Due to the highly low utilization rate of routing switches, majority of the power reduction is achieved by power gating unused routing buffers. In contrast, recent work that considers Vdd programmability only for logic fabric reduces total FPGA power merely by 14.29%. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first in-depth study on Vdd programmability for FPGA interconnect power reduction.	benchmark (computing);clock rate;design closure;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;ic power-supply pin;network switch;power gating;routing;switched fabric;universal turing machine;value-driven design	Fei Li;Yan Lin;Lei He	2004	IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design, 2004.

In a two-phase clock system, the amplifier can be split into two identical small amplifiers in one phase simultaneously for use in two circuits. Next, the two small amplifiers can be merged into one amplifier in the other phase for usage in another circuit. Compared with the conventional opamp sharing, a more power-efficient amplifier arrangement is achieved in the split mode. In this paper, three individual sample-and-hold (S/H) circuits with the proposed technique are designed to demonstrate the efficiency of memory effect cancellation. The simulations show that in contrast to the output spectrum of two S/H circuits with conventional opamp sharing, the spurious tones due to the memory effect can be suppressed by at least 14.66 dB in the split mode and at least 7.32 dB in the combination mode with a 0.6- $\text{V}_{\text {P-P}}$  input signal when using the proposed technique.	clock network;clock signal;memory effect;operational amplifier;sample and hold;simulation;two-phase commit protocol	I-Jen Chao;Bin-Da Liu;Soon-Jyh Chang;Chun-Yueh Huang;Hsin-Wen Ting	2017	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2586184	electronic engineering;real-time computing;parasitic capacitance;sense amplifier;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;very-large-scale integration;direct-coupled amplifier;memory management	EDA	17.09849413395805	55.95078337165	167963

System-on-Chip (SoC) test schedules not only need to achieve the shortest possible test application time, they must also satisfy new design constraints which are increasing test scheduling complexity, such as device power. Although many past studies of SoC test scheduling have addressed individual issues during test, none have present a model of test scheduling that has allowed for many different constraints to be enforced at once. By presenting a test scheduling formulation that allows the enforcement of many separate power and hardware constraints, including issues of test pins, as well as allowing the use of modern Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) hardware to further compact test schedules, this study provides a generalized test scheduling formulation that will not only allow the enforcement of multiple testing constraints but will also allow for the further compaction of test schedules and reduction of test cost.	data compaction;dynamic frequency scaling;dynamic voltage scaling;integrated circuit;mpsoc;requirement;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);semiconductor;system on a chip;test-driven development	Spencer K.

Leakage depends nearly exponentially on linewidth (gate length), and even small variations in linewidth introduce large variability in leakage. A substantial fraction of linewidth variation is systematic with respect to the device layout context. Detailed placement changes context of the devices that are near the cell boundaries and can be used to reduce leakage. Our approach modifies the placement of cells in small windows such that contexts that reduce leakage are created. During this optimization, cells are partitioned into rows and then placed in rows using a traveling salesman problem formulation.	heart rate variability;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;spectral leakage;travelling salesman problem	Andrew B.

a34ad06805d5a7db3bc7c1791ae1cfd9b46398c1	sat based solutions for detailed routing of island style fpga architectures	switch box architecture;fpga;boolean satisfiability;detailed routing	Detailed routing solutions for island style FPGA architectures using Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based formulations have been proposed in this paper. Due to decreasing size of ICs and hence, the increasing complexity of the routing resource constraints, routing has been a big challenge in electronic design automation field. Our proposed techniques work on multi-pin net routing where all nets are considered for routing in their intact form whereas, most of the existing routing solutions decompose multi-pin nets into two-pin nets for detailed routing to ease the problem. However this approach, apart from increasing the number of nets in the circuits, may also introduce pin doglegging which, when not permitted by the architecture of FPGA, would require extra constraints to eliminate. Many detailed routers adopt sequential detailed routing approaches which are vulnerable to the net ordering problem which may cause a routable circuit to be erroneously classified as unroutable. Our proposed techniques avoid these pitfalls by keeping the multi-pin nets intact and solve all nets simultaneously using SAT. The SAT-based multi-pin net dogleg-free formulations presented here achieve significant improvement over existing SAT-based solutions with respect to the number of variables and clauses used, thereby achieving greater scalability and also display comparable and sometimes better routability results on benchmark circuits when compared with other detailed routing solutions. Detailed routing is also significantly affected by the architecture of the switching blocks. This paper proposes SAT-based formulation for three different switch box architectures i.e. Subset, Wilton, and Universal switches. Our experiments clearly demonstrate how routing solutions for a circuit can differ significantly for different types of switch boxes.	field-programmable gate array;routing	Shyamapada Mukherjee;Suchismita Roy	2015	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2015.05.003	routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;real-time computing;dsrflow;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;boolean satisfiability problem;triangular routing;path vector protocol;routing;algorithm;routing information protocol;field-programmable gate array	EDA	13.728362259868593	53.566175168384916	170739

But can this continue despite the serious problems of litho, variability, device physics, and cost? This panel looks at several possibilities. Perhaps Moore's law will muddle through, as it has so far, with a combination of tools, process, and design. But even if technically possible, Moore's law is in practice driven by economics, and economics might turn against further scaling. Also, we've all seen how performance of single cores has topped out, despite scaling. Might this be a fundamental problem with planar technologies, prompting the need to go 3-D to get further performance increases? Or might CMOS itself give way to other technologies, allowing Moore's law yet another respite? Compare and contrast for yourself these four very different visions of the future of your job, your industry, and your personal gadgets.	cmos;heart rate variability;image scaling;moore's law;yet another	Robert C.

Power gating, in which regions of the chip can be powered down, has been shown to be effective at reducing leakage power. However, previous techniques focus on statically-controlled power gating. In this paper, we propose a modification to the fabric of an FPGA that enables dynamically-controlled power gating, in which logic clusters can be selectively powered-down at run-time. For applications containing blocks with large idle times, this could lead to significant leakage power savings. Our architecture utilizes the existing routing fabric and unused input pins of logic clusters to route the power control signals. No modifications to the existing routing algorithms are required to support the new architecture. We study the area and power tradeoffs by varying the basic architecture parameters of an FPGA, and by varying the size of the power gating regions. We also study the leakage energy savings using a model that characterizes an application in terms of its structure and behavior. We show less than 1% of area overhead for a power gating region size of 3X3 logic tiles. Using the application model, we show that up to 40% leakage energy reduction can be achieved using the proposed architecture for different application parameters, not including power dissipated by the power state controller.	algorithm;field-programmable gate array;overhead (computing);power gating;routing;spectral leakage	Assem A.

b99172a2c40368a24d4316a2ac7d40880bb2e866	dll-assisted clock synchronization method for multi-die ics		For a multi-die IC, the chip-level clock synchronization problem that aims to establish a global clock signal across multiple functional dies is harder to achieve than its single-die counterpart. In this work, we investigate a process resilient solution for this problem by incorporating Delay-Locked Loops (DLLs). The basic idea is to insert a DLL (which can be generated by a DLL compiler) in each functional die so that the clock latency (from a clock source to the clock ports of a number of FFs) in different dies can be dynamically tuned and equalized. This method has a benefit that the clock network of each die can be designed independently, while the clock skew of the entire chip can still be minimized at run-time, in response to its operating environment. In a preliminary study, experimental results on a pseudo 4-die design demonstrates how the clock skew as high as 233ps initially can be reduced to 34ps after the application of the proposed method.	cmos;clock network;clock signal;clock skew;clock synchronization;compiler;die (integrated circuit);directive (programming);dynamic-link library;operating environment;wafer-level packaging	Chia-Yuan Cheng;Shi-Yu Huang;Ding-Ming Kwai;Yung-Fa Chou	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)	10.1109/ICCD.2017.83	clock domain crossing;parallel computing;clock synchronization;real-time computing;cpu multiplier;clock skew;digital clock manager;computer science;clock network;self-clocking signal;clock signal	EDA	16.455851061583573	56.094443498778865	172036

As the IoT calls for the deployment of trillions of WSNs, minimizing the carbon footprint for WSN chip manufacturing further emerges as a third target in a design-for-the-environment (DfE) perspective. The SleepWalker microcontroller is a 65-nm ultralow-voltage SoC based on the MSP430 architecture capable of delivering increased speed performances at 25 MHz for only 7 μW/MHz at 0.4 V. Its sub-mm2 die area with low external component requirement ensures a low carbon footprint for chip manufacturing. SleepWalker incorporates an on-chip adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) system with DC/DC converter, clock generator, memories, sensor and communication interfaces, making it suited for WSN applications. An LP/GP process mix is fully exploited for minimizing the energy per cycle, with power gating to keep stand-by power at 1.7 μW. By incorporating a glitch-masking instruction cache, system power can be reduced by up to 52%. The AVS system ensures proper 25-MHz operation over process and temperature variations from -40 °C to +85 °C, with a peak efficiency of the DC/DC converter above 80%. Finally, a multi-Vt clock tree reduces variability-induced clock skew by 3 × to ensure robust timing closure down to 0.3 V.	cmos;cpu cache;clock generator;clock skew;dynamic voltage scaling;glitch;heart rate variability;image scaling;integrated circuit;microcontroller;overhead (computing);performance;power domains;power gating;programming paradigm;sensor;software deployment;static random-access memory;switched capacitor;system on a chip;ti msp430;timing closure;ultra-low-voltage processor	David Bol;Julien De Vos;Cédric Hocquet;François Botman;François Durvaux;Sarah Boyd;Denis Flandre;Jean-Didier Legat	2013	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2012.2218067	carbon;microcontroller;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;cmos;internet of things	Mobile	15.240458413002791	57.990583632367894	172196

Recent advances in non-volatile STT-RAM technology, which stores data by the spin orientation of a soft ferromagnetic material and shows current induced switching, have created interest for its use as embedded memory [1-3]. When a spin-polarized current passes through a mono-domain ferromagnet, it attempts to polarize the current in its preferred direction of magnetic moment. As the ferromagnet absorbs some of the angular momentum of the electrons, it creates a torque that causes a flip in the direction of magnetization in the ferromagnet. This is used in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) based spin torque transfer (STT) RAM cells where a thin insulator (MgO) is sandwiched between a fixed ferromagnetic layer (polarizer) and the free layer (storage node). This can be integrated in the metal stack (Fig. 1) and hence provide high memory density. Depending on the direction of the current flow (perpendicular to these layers in our study), the magnetization of the free layer is switched to a parallel (P: low resistance state) or anti-parallel (AP: high resistance state) state. The minimum size cell (mincell) contains an access transistor (Tx) of width 2F (WTX=2F, F: half-pitch of the process node) and a planar storage node of dimensions 2FxF. The area of the mincell is 3Fx2F=6F2. In this paper, we examine the design space for key magnetic material properties and access transistor needed for embedded on-die memory with adequate scalability, density, read/write performance and robustness against various intrinsic variabilities and disturbances. New models and simulation methodologies, calibrated to existing measurements [1], for read, write and disturbance mechanisms are developed. Different storage node structures and materials are evaluated to reveal the most promising scaling options.	angularjs;areal density (computer storage);cmos;calibration (statistics);central processing unit;design space exploration;edram;embedded system;high memory;image scaling;non-volatile memory;polarizer;scalability;simulation;static random-access memory;topological insulator;transistor;tunneling protocol	Arijit Raychowdhury	2013	2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)		embedded system;electromigration;electronic engineering;verification;magnetization;electrical engineering;angular momentum;redundancy;magnetic moment;quantum mechanics;ferromagnetism	EDA	16.632676026165008	60.16426252028186	172310

Three-dimensional stacking of heterogeneous silicon layers also enables heterogeneous 3-D integration. Thanks to the enormous efforts put into 3-D integration in academia and industry, a few 3-D products such as 3-D field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and through-silicon-via (TSV)-based dynamic random access memory (DRAM) have finally been commercialized in the semiconductor market. Commercialization of more diverse 3-D integrated circuit (IC) products, however, still requires novel solutions for various challenging issues such as effective heat removal and lack of standards, applications, and computer-aided design (CAD) tools for design, analysis, and optimization of 3-D ICs. The Special Issue on Advances in 3-D Integrated Circuits, Systems, and CAD Tools, published in IEEE Design & Test in July/August 2015 introduced seven papers to highlight recent research on 3-D integration. The papers covered a wide range of topics on 3-D ICs from 3-D IC manufacturing process and 3-D integration technology to thermal analysis, 3-D design-for-test architectures, 3-D integration of memory and logic, test methodologies for 3-D ICs, and 3-D memory architectures. As a second part of the Special Issue on Advances in 3-D Integrated Circuits, Systems, and CAD Tools, this special issue presents four more papers that highlight recent advances in test methodologies for 3-D interconnects, modeling of TSVs and TSV channels, memory architecture optimization for 3-D stacked DRAM, and codesign of 3-D CPUs and microfluidic pin-fin cooling structures. “Delay Characterization and Testing of Arbitrary Multiple-Pin Interconnects” by Huang et al., proposes a test methodology to detect delay faults in multipin interconnects in 3-D ICs with 10-ps resolution. The idea is to insert a multiplexer for each pitcher cell driving a 3-D interconnect and a multiplexer for each receiver cell so that a global ring structure is formed to test each 3-D interconnect. The authors also present a clock period measurement circuit to achieve a measurement accuracy of 10 ps. “High-Frequency Temperature-Dependent ThroughSilicon-Via (TSV) Model and High-Speed Channel Performance for 3-D ICs” by Lee et al., presents high-frequency temperature-dependent RLGC models for TSVs and TSV channels. The authors verify the models against measurement data and show the impact of temperature variation on noise coupling between two neighboring TSVs and between two neighboring TSV channels.

It includes the three viable candidates to push lithography beyond the 20nm logic node. (1) Extension of immersion lithography beyond the optical resolution limit by multiple patterning.

dd0e98fa6c0f5bee87915be9b7b558a940d5e4a0	beyond structural test, the rising need for system-level test		The steady march of Moore's Law in semiconductors has enabled the creation of ever more complex systems with electronics playing a central role. As a result, thorough testing of individual components is no longer adequate to ensure overall system performance, quality, and reliability. The rising importance of system-level test (SLT) to supplement traditional component structural test has gained wide recognition recently. To understand this trend, we examine where traditional testing falls short and where SLT fills the gap. In many cases, system failures are the result of complex component interactions leading to abnormal scenarios not attributable to simple and single root causes. Rather than being confined by traditional gate-level fault models, it might be more appropriate to develop a system-level fault model derived as an emergent property of complex systems. New definitions of fault coverage and how to automate high-coverage test generation are obvious challenges in the system domain. Recent developments in design verification which faces similar challenges in dealing with system complexity may offer possible solutions for SLT to draw on. The aim is to stimulate new ideas and directions for future research in system-based testing as upcoming 5G/IoT/AI-based applications penetrate deeper and pervasively into our daily lives.	complex systems;emergence;fault coverage;fault model;functional testing;hoc (programming language);image scaling;interaction;moore's law;semiconductor;turing test	Harry H.

Previously proposed algorithms assign logic gates with sufficient timing slack to high threshold voltage to reduce leakage power without impact on timing. Meanwhile, clock skew scheduling algorithms are always utilized to optimize period or timing slack. In order to further reduce subthreshold leakage power consumption, in this paper, we ingeniously combine dual voltage assignment technique with intended clock skew scheduling: First, a leakage weight based clock skew scheduling algorithm is proposed to enlarge the leakage power optimization potential. Then we employ a dual-threshold voltage assignment algorithm to minimize leakage power. The experimental results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits show that, within only several seconds, the leakage power can be further reduced by as much as 41.30% and by 9.87% on average with this new approach, compared to using the traditional method without considering clock skews. Three timing optimized industrial circuit blocks, among which each has around one hundred thousand gates, have also been optimized. It is shown that an average leakage power reduction of 9.95% can be achieved within minutes compared with traditional techniques.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);clock skew;effective method;logic gate;mathematical optimization;power optimization (eda);scheduling (computing);slack variable;spectral leakage	Meng Tie;Haiying Dong;Tong Wang;Xu Cheng	2010	2010 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE 2010)		job shop scheduling;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;logic gate;computer science;engineering;timing failure;clock gating	EDA	16.375590777979866	54.551140115627625	175414

The result of coarse 4-bit is used to generate a reference level for fine 2-bit converting using full parallel structure.

This design environment is contributes to finding design constraints from initial package layout at early design stages. By feeding these constraints forward to later detailed design stages, extra design iterations can be removed.

However, the board-level voltage levels could be still in a higher voltage levels (2timesVDD, or even more) for compatible to some earlier interface specifications in a microelectronics system. The I/O interface circuits have been designed with consideration on the gate-oxide reliability in such mixed-voltage applications. In this work, a new mixed-voltage crystal oscillator circuit realized with low-voltage CMOS devices is proposed without suffering the gate-oxide reliability issue. The proposed mixed-voltage crystal oscillator circuit, which is one of the key I/O cells in a cell library, has been designed and verified in a 90-nm I-V CMOS process to serve 1/1.8-V mixed-voltage interface applications.	cmos;crystal oscillator;gate oxide;input/output;power supply;thickness (graph theory)	Ming-Dou Ker;Hung-Tai Liao	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378207	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;oscillation;cmos	EDA	16.796554005705413	58.320883372090506	178728

The overall economic benefits, the potential synergies, the overall tradeoffs, and the scalability of the benefits of these techniques, are complex to understand and currently not well understood. This problem will be analyzed in this paper by using technical cost modeling. The dependency of the benefits on different applications will be analyzed by modeling the test cost for four different applications. It will be shown that the right match between the application and a combination of the described techniques can result in a significant reduction of the cost of test. Moreover, it will be shown that this optimal match evolves during technology progress and can enable a scalable reduction of the cost of test.	scalability;synergy;test vector	Erik H.

This simplification ignor es the effe cts of glitch tr ansitions which may contribute as much as 30% of the total power c onsumption of a circuit. Hence, low power logic synthesis techniques which optimize power under a zer o delay model ar e often not successful in attaining “r eal” p ower savings as measured under a more accurate gener al delay model. In pr actice, to ac curately estimate the switching activity in a circuit under a gener al delay model can be computationally expensive. Hence, to repeatedly call accurate but slow power estimation tools to dir ect the synthesis flow is not a viable approach in the design of low power synthesis tools. In this pap er we take advantage of a fast method for estimating the total switching activity in a circuit under a general delay model to synthesize low power circuits. Sp ecific ally,we use the appr oximation as a basis for algorithms that solve two problems: (1) low power te chnolo gy decomposition of gates under a gener al delay model (2) low power r etiming of sequential cir cuits under a general delay model.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;autoregressive model;glitch;level of detail;logic synthesis;regular expression	Unni G Narayanan;Peichen Pan;C.

We discuss the margins for reset/set/read operations based on measurement results and identified that it is impossible to distinguish between reset/set operations by controlling the bit-line voltage. We propose a new tri-level voltage word-line control (3LV-WL) scheme to clearly operate set operations. Moreover, we investigated the read disturb operation and developed a new reduced-actual-read-access (RA2) scheme to attain 500 times the read retention time. We also developed a source line control (SLC) scheme to attain an 18% smaller cell size and a 19-F/sup 2/ memory cell with enough reset current to clearly reset the PC material. With the application of these approaches, we established reset/set/read operations with the lowest possible voltage, 1.5 V with logic CMOS, for a low-cost embedded memory with a few additional masks.	cmos;command & conquer: red alert 2;edram;embedded system;flash memory;memory cell (binary);multi-level cell;nonvolatile bios memory;phase-change memory;random-access memory;triangular function	Kenichi Osada;Takayuki Kawahara;Riichiro Takemura;Naoki Kitai;Norikatsu Takaura;Nozomu Matsuzaki;Kenzo Kurotsuchi;Hiroshi Moriya;Masahiro Moniwa	2005	Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.	10.1109/CICC.2005.1568698	auxiliary memory;interleaved memory;power-on reset;electronic engineering;semiconductor memory;real-time computing;sense amplifier;memory refresh;computer hardware;computer science;bubble memory;computer memory;non-volatile random-access memory;conventional memory;registered memory;sequential access memory;phase change	EDA	16.934328950704298	59.30463579418577	182141

In this paper, we show that wafer-level package interconnects are an effective alternative to conventional on-chip global wires. These interconnects behave as LC transmission lines and can be exploited for their near speed of light transmission and low attenuation characteristics. We compare performance measures such as bandwidth, bandwidth density, latency, and power consumption of the package-level transmission lines with conventional on-chip global interconnects for different International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) technology nodes. Based on these results, we show that package-level interconnects are well suited for power demanding low-latency applications.

Among the various types of DG devices, quasi-planar SOI FinFETs are easier to manufacture compared to planar double-gate devices. DG devices with independent gates (separate contacts to back and front gates) have recently been developed. DG devices with symmetric and asymmetric gates have also been demonstrated. Such device options have direct implications at the circuit level. Independent control of front and back gate in DG devices can be effectively used to improve performance and reduce power in sub-50nm circuits. Independent gate control can be used to merge parallel transistors in noncritical paths. This results in reduction in the effective switching capacitance and hence power dissipation. We show a variety of circuits in logic and memory that can benefit from independent gate operation of DG devices. As examples, we show the benefit of independent gate operation in circuits such as dynamic logic circuits, Schmitt triggers, sense amplifiers, and SRAM cells. In addition to independent gate option, we also investigate the usefulness of asymmetric devices and the impact of width quantization and process variations on circuit design.	amplifier;cmos;circuit design;database trigger;discontinuous galerkin method;gnu nano;logic gate;low-power broadcasting;pulse-width modulation;scalability;schmitt trigger;silicon on insulator;static random-access memory;transistor	Kaushik Roy;Hamid Mahmoodi;Saibal Mukhopadhyay;Hari Ananthan;Aditya Bansal;Tamer Cakici	2005	19th International Conference on VLSI Design held jointly with 5th International Conference on Embedded Systems Design (VLSID'06)	10.1109/VLSID.2006.74	nanoelectronics;dynamic logic;gate array;embedded system;electronic engineering;nmos logic;logic gate;computer science;engineering;gate equivalent;electrical engineering;dissipation;critical path method;circuit design;silicon on insulator;pass transistor logic;nand gate;process variation;low-power electronics	EDA	16.41434053433935	59.131382044175254	183500

7664183184e47ef0f521eacd3f251b91b246df26	guest editorial fpl 2013		"""The International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) is one of the most prestigious research and development events in the area of field-programmable logic. The FPL conference series aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry worldwide for broad discussions and exchanges on the theoretical and practical issues facing this rapidly evolving area, including, but not limited to applications, advanced Electronic Design Automation (EDA), novel system architectures, embedded processors, arithmetic, and dynamic re-configuration. The 23rd FPL continued the tradition of previous FPL editions and took place on September 2–4, 2013, in Porto, Portugal. It is our pleasure to present in this special ACM TRETS issue extended versions of a selected set of five papers accepted and presented at FPL 2013. The articles included in this special issue and their research contributions and highlights, which we present below , have been selected out of the 57 conference papers covering various topics, namely CAD (Kevin E. Murray et al., and Ricardo Ferreira et al.), communication security (Zsolt István et al.), fault-tolerance (Anup Das et al.), and scientific computations (Lin Gan et al.). presents a framework and representative complex benchmarks to evaluate mapping, placement, and routing algorithms for island-style FPGA architectures. The framework uses VPR and allows the use of large benchmarks and the exploration of algorithms when targeting an enhanced version of the Altera's Stratix IV FPGA architecture. By providing a comparison of the results achieved by VPR with those achieved by Altera's Quartus II CAD software, this work reveals its high importance for further scientific research related to mapping, placement, and routing. proposes a placement and routing algorithm for homogeneous FPGAs that is suitable for use at runtime. The algorithm is based on a graph mapping approach and uses a greedy polynomial time heuristic. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the algorithm is able to place and route designs very quickly, without significantly compromising placement and routing quality. Due to the growing importance of runtime placement and routing, this article is a step forward on researching efficient algorithms to make it practical. The domain of Internet communication for simple routing to security is a growing area of applicability for FPGA technology.

3627e97c1a1ea58cf107d724cc7db164a18de751	manufacturing pathway and experimental demonstration for nanoscale fine-grained 3-d integrated circuit fabric		At Sub-20nm technologies CMOS scaling faces severe challenges primarily due to fundamental device scaling limitations, interconnection overhead and complex manufacturing. Migration to 3-D has been long sought as a possible pathway to continue scaling; however, CMOS's intrinsic requirements are not compatible for fine-grained 3-D integration. In [1], we proposed a truly fine-grained 3-D integrated circuit fabric called Skybridge that solves nanoscale challenges and achieves orders of magnitude benefits over CMOS. In Skybridge, device, circuit, connectivity, thermal management and manufacturing issues are addressed in an integrated 3-D compatible manner. At the core of Skybridge's assembly are uniform vertical nanowires, which are functionalized with architected features for fabric integration. All active components are created primarily using sequential material deposition steps on these nanowires. Lithography and doping precision requirements are significantly reduced, and are primarily required in early stages. In this paper, we discuss manufacturing aspects of Skybridge fabric; we introduce Skybridge's manufacturing pathway and show experimental demonstrations of key process steps.	cmos;distributed manufacturing;doping (semiconductor);gene regulatory network;image scaling;integrated circuit;interconnection;layer (electronics);overhead (computing);physical vapor deposition;requirement;thermal management of high-power leds	Mostafizur Rahman;Jiajun Shi;Mingyu Li;Santosh Khasanvis;Csaba Andras Moritz	2015	2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)		electronic engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology	EDA	12.525809188473618	57.80396600396099	187975

The cell has a weighted control input whose resistance is set based on a control signal that generalizes the operational regime from NAND to NOR functionality. We further show how threshold logic in the voltage-controlled resistive cell can be used to implement a XOR logic. Building on the same principle we implement a half adder and a 4-bit CLA (Carry Look-ahead Adder) and show that in comparison with CMOS-only logic, the proposed system shows significant improvements in terms of device area, power dissipation and leakage power.	4-bit;adder (electronics);boolean algebra;cmos;logic family;logic gate;memristor;spectral leakage;xor gate	Akshay Kumar Maan;Alex Pappachen James	2016	2016 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS)	10.1109/APCCAS.2016.7803980	control engineering;and-or-invert;electronic engineering;nmos logic;logic synthesis;memristor;nor logic;logic optimization;xor gate;logic level;logic gate;logic family;three-input universal logic gate;programmable logic array;depletion-load nmos logic;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;pass transistor logic;sequential logic;threshold voltage;resistance;nand logic;digital electronics;pmos logic;adder;emitter-coupled logic	EDA	16.289018137992564	58.756853094053184	188231

Thus simultaneous switching noise (SSN) must be considered for robust power/ground (P/G) network design. In this paper, we mainly focus on the SSN effects for P/G network optimization. We first point out the drawbacks of the P/G optimization process without considering the SSN, by analyzing the optimized P/G grids. Then we propose a random walk based technique to consider SSN by adding decoupling capacitor (decap) prior to the nonlinear optimization process. This additional decap allocation phase constructs good current return path for the switching current caused by clock buffers and then reduces the dynamic voltage drop. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves 2X speed up over the original approach without adding decaps in advance while the decap budget overhead is acceptable.	bounce address;conjugate gradient method;coupling (computer programming);dmz (computing);mathematical optimization;network planning and design;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);rc circuit;semiconductor;speedup;subscriber identity module	Le Kang;Yici Cai;Jin Shi;Xianlong Hong;Sheldon X.-D.

In this paper, we propose a new method that combines approaches of Dual Threshold CMOS (DTCMOS), mixed-Tox CMOS, and pin-reordering. As the reduction of leakage leads to an increase of gate delay, our purpose is the reduction of total leakage at constant design performance. We modified a given technology and developed a library with a new mixed gate type. Compared to the case where all devices are set to high performance, our approach achieves an average leakage reduction of 65%, whereas design performance stays constant.	cmos;gate oxide;power optimization (eda);propagation delay;spectral leakage;thickness (graph theory);tox;tunneling protocol	Frank Sill;Frank Grassert;Dirk Timmermann	2005	2005 18th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design	10.1145/1081081.1081123	embedded system;electronic engineering;performance;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;leakage;nand gate;threshold voltage;cmos;integrated circuit design	EDA	17.228451411273735	55.8704587532981	188590

This year, NAND Flash memories are demonstrated in 3D technologies with up to 64 stacked word-line layers. An embedded split-gate NOR Flash is also shown to dramatically reduce power consumption and meet the requirements of high-temperature sensing applications.

However, the success or failure of such circuits hinges on the existence of a locally controllable and low power clock field. Existing work has largely assumed the availability of such a clock field that would be almost impossible to fabricate or that exhibits an ideal distribution in space. This paper uses a fabricatable clock structure proposed in [10] as the basis to investigate all possible non-ideal properties (due to fabrication limitations and variations) of the resulting clock field. How such a clock impacts the logical correctness of a magnetic circuit element is verified via micromagnetic simulation. The impact on performance and power is also considered.	adder (electronics);cmos;correctness (computer science);electrical element;execution unit;extrapolation;ibm notes;magnetic logic;multiprotocol label switching;simulation;thickness (graph theory)	Aaron Dingler;M.

A Virtex-II-style two-dimensional (2-D) FPGA fabric is used as a baseline architecture to quantify the relative improvements in logic density, delay, and power consumption achieved by such a 3-D FPGA. It is assumed that only the switch transistor and configuration memory cells can be moved to the top layers and that the 3-D FPGA employs the same LB and programmable interconnect architecture as the baseline 2-D FPGA. Assuming they are les 0.7, the area of a static random-access memory cell and switch transistors having the same characteristics as n-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor devices in the CMOS layer are used. It is shown that a monolithically stacked 3-D FPGA can achieve 3.2 times higher logic density, 1.7 times lower critical path delay, and 1.7 times lower total dynamic power consumption than the baseline 2-D FPGA fabricated in the same 65-nm technology node	field-programmable gate array	Mingjie Lin;Abbas El Gamal;Yi-Chang Lu;S.

e9dd3a21be12b89458f807df3b4d85b709fb1e8d	introduction to the special issue on reliable, resilient, and robust design of circuits and systems		Computational systems have long been designed under the premise that their fundamental circuit elements function correctly and reliably. As technology continues to scale, this premise no longer holds due to physical effects, thermal effects, and increased process variation. In May 2014, the ACM Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI) was held in Houston, Texas. In addition to the traditional topic areas of GLSVLSI, the conference had a special theme on reliability, resiliency, and robustness from circuits to systems. To highlight some of the work focused on this theme, the GLSVLSI Program Chairs, in consultation with the Editor-in-Chief, sent out a call for papers for a special issue in TODAES on recent advances in new techniques and methodologies to address reliability, resiliency, and robustness of future computing systems. GLSVLSI 2014 authors with papers related to the special topic were especially encouraged to contribute. The guest editors have selected seven diverse articles, all related to this theme, for inclusion in this special issue of TODAES. The following is a brief introduction to the seven articles. The first two articles focus on mitigating soft errors. The article entitled “SingleEvent Multiple-Transient Characterization and Mitigation via Alternative Standard Cell Placement Methods” by Kiddie et al. presents a technique to analyze the effects of single-event radiation on multiple devices and investigates how standard cell placements can be used to improve reliability. The article by Delshadtehrani et al. entitled “In-Scratchpad Memory Replication: Protecting Scratchpad Memories in Multi-Core Embedded Systems Against Soft Errors” describes an efficient data replication mechanism to correct multi-bit upsets in scratchpad memories found in multicore embedded systems. The next three articles employ various emerging technologies for the design of reliable nonvolatile memory and delay elements. The first of these articles by Papandreou et al. entitled “Enhancing the Reliability of MLC NAND Flash Memory Systems by Read Channel Optimization” investigates the use of adaptive voltage thresholds and interference cancellation to improve device reliability in NAND flash memory. Failure rates in resistive random-access memory due to both soft and hard errors are explored in the article “Impact of Cell Failure on Reliable Cross-Point Resistive Memory Design,” by Xu et al. Digitally tunable current flow to better manage processand temperatureinduced performance fluctuations is examined by Zhang and Kaneko in the article “Robust and Low-Power Digitally Programmable Delay Element Designs Employing Neuron-MOS Mechanism.” The final two articles focus more on the system level. The article by Kim et al., “Use it or Lose It: Proactive, Deterministic Longevity in Future Chip Multiprocessors”, investigates wearout due to negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) from real workloads applied to the on-chip interconnect in chip multiprocessors. Finally, a new methodology to apply targeted optimizations that improve reliability at lower	computation;electrical element;embedded system;flash memory;interference (communication);multi-core processor;multi-level cell;negative-bias temperature instability;neuron;nonvolatile bios memory;proactive parallel suite;random access;replication (computing);resistive random-access memory;scratchpad memory;single event upset;standard cell;very-large-scale integration	R.

This paper presents two efficient ExTest scheduling strategies that implements interconnect testing between tiles inside an SoC die while satisfying the practical constraint that the number of required test pins cannot exceed the number of available pins at the chip level. These strategies target two different ways in which SoC dies are wrapped in 2.5-D ICs. The first scheduling approach is aimed at an extremely large SoC in which the wrapper design requires concurrent testing of the interconnects driving the tile under test. The second scheduling approach is applicable to more general wrapper designs that provide more flexibility in terms of the manner in which these interconnects can be tested. In both test strategies, the tiles in the SoC die are divided into groups based on the manner in which they are interconnected. In order to minimize the test time, two optimization solutions are introduced. The first solution minimizes the number of input test pins, and the second solution minimizes the number of output test pins. In addition, two subgroup configuration methods are further proposed to generate subgroups inside each test group. To highlight the effectiveness of the proposed test strategies, we present scheduling and optimization results for two SoC dies for 2.5-D ICs currently in production.	2.5d;concurrent testing;electrical connection;integrated circuit;interposer;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);speaker wire;system on a chip	Ran Wang;GuoLiang Li;Rui Li;Jun Qian;Krishnendu Chakrabarty	2017	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2016.2611515	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;operating system;software testing;silicon;scheduling	EDA	12.002571425251734	53.81967968081613	189928

To this aim, the differential MOS Current-Mode Logic (MCML) is adopted as reference logic style, and a complete differential design flow is used. Analysis shows that the choice of the grid size in differential routing has a much stronger impact on the power-delay-area tradeoff, compared to the usual single-ended case, hence the grid size must be carefully selected. The dependence of power, delay and area on the grid size is discussed in detail through simple models and metrics. To validate the approach and show basic dependencies in practical circuits, 30 benchmark circuits with an in-house designed MCML cell library were synthesized and routed in a 0.18-µm CMOS technology. Results show that non-optimal choice of the grid size can determine a dramatic increase in power (1.7X) and area (1.3X). Interestingly, the grid size that optimizes the power-delay-area tradeoff depends very weakly on the specific circuit under design, hence a generally optimum grid size exists that optimizes a very wide range of different circuits.	benchmark (computing);cmos;current-mode logic;digital electronics;mathematical optimization;routing;single-ended signaling;very-large-scale integration	Massimo Alioto;Stéphane Badel;Yusuf Leblebici	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117998	routing;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;electrical engineering;very-large-scale integration	EDA	15.754655424395658	55.21093469251655	190450
109df41159461f4a690cf6251a5dee3cdfa52e7d	ultra-low energy data driven computing using asynchronous micropipelines and nano-electro-mechanical relays		Asynchronous logic and power gating are promising techniques for low duty cycle applications which need maximal energy efficiency, which are becoming more common-place with the popularity of wireless and embedded systems. This paper investigates the potential use of Nano/Micro- Electro- Mechanical (N/MEM) switches as the means of power gating asynchronous computation. A systematic optimization of the N/MEMS parameters is performed using finite element analysis (FEA) in the multiphysics COMSOL tool. An asynchronous FIR filter with a 4-phase bundled-data handshake protocol is designed and implemented in the 90nm technology node. The N/MEMS switches are comparatively studied with conventional sleep transistors in a system where both the computation and the timing controls for the asynchronous FIR circuits are power gated appropriately. It is demonstrated that our N/MEMS solution offers a 69% energy improvement when 32-tap FIR filter is power gated at a data rate of 1KHz compared to a 39% savings realized by using sleep transistors in the same design.	asynchronous circuit;computation;data rate units;duty cycle;embedded system;finite element method;finite impulse response;gnu nano;mathematical optimization;maximal set;microelectromechanical systems;multiphysics;network switch;norm (social);power gating;relay;requirement;semiconductor device fabrication;transistor;uncompressed video;uptime	Haider Alrudainy;Andrey Mokhov;Fei Xia;Alexandre Yakovlev	2017	2017 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)	10.1109/ISVLSI.2017.36	duty cycle;asynchronous circuit;transistor;power gating;electronic circuit;control engineering;logic gate;asynchronous communication;multiphysics;electronic engineering;engineering	Embedded	15.16903874361542	57.9047531650228	191466

In this proposed design approach, three novelties are highlighted. Firstly, a novel microcell-interleaving approach is proposed to reduce the number of completion detection (CD) circuits while retaining the required QDI attribute. Secondly, we analyze the performance of the QDI circuits based on the proposed microcell-interleaving approach graphically in terms of power dissipation, transistor count and delay, and evaluate/determine the upper and lower boundaries of these performance profiles. Thirdly, we propose a microcell-interleaving genetic algorithm (MIGA) to stochastically optimize the proposed microcell-interleaving approach on power dissipation, transistor count, and delay. To validate the proposed design approach, a complete performance profile of ISCAS-85 C499 circuit is investigated on the basis of differential cascode voltage switch logic (DCVSL) and dynamic strong indicating (DSI) microcells. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed design approach by benchmarking against the competing DCVSL, null convention logic and DSI designs on five ISCAS-85 circuits. Specifically, the proposed designs, on average, are 1.77 × better in power dissipation, 1.4 × better in area, and 1.58 × better in a composite metric of power × area × delay, and reasonably slower for the lowest power dissipation points. We further demonstrate the practicality of the proposed design approach by implementing an 8-tap 16-bit asynchronous QDI finite impulse response filter. Finally, we demonstrate the ~10% and ~11% improved efficiency of the proposed MIGA over the greedy algorithm and dynamic programming, respectively.	16-bit;asynchronous circuit;benchmark (computing);cpu power dissipation;cascode voltage switch logic;delay insensitive circuit;dynamic programming;filter design;finite impulse response;forward error correction;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;logic gate;overhead (computing);supercomputer education research centre;transistor count	Rong Zhou;Kwen-Siong Chong;Bah-Hwee Gwee;Joseph Sylvester Chang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2014.2309859	embedded system;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;genetic algorithm;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;algorithm;computer network	EDA	16.657244283967607	55.877024904171684	192155

The high temperature is a prominent issue during test and should be taken care of during the test process. Modern SoCs, affected by large process variation, experience rapid and large temperature deviations and, therefore, a traditional static test schedule which is unaware of these deviations will be suboptimal in terms of speed and/or thermal-safety. This paper presents an adaptive test scheduling method which addresses the temperature deviations and acts accordingly in order to improve the test speed and thermal-safety. The proposed method is divided into a computationally intense offline-phase, and a very simple online-phase. In the offline-phase a schedule tree is constructed, and in the online-phase the appropriate path in the schedule tree is traversed, step by step and based on temperature sensor readings. Experiments have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method.	algorithm;care-of address;experiment;online and offline;residual sum of squares;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;system on a chip;test case;two-phase locking;very-large-scale integration	Nima Aghaee;Zebo Peng;Petru Eles	2011	2011 14th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design	10.1109/DSD.2011.29	system on a chip;embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;computerized adaptive testing	EDA	15.413785600446138	55.45788883687782	192453

5d7aca087f63461884662e4174de2ed558e6916b	a monolithic-3d sram design with enhanced robustness and in-memory computation support		We present a novel 3D-SRAM cell using a Monolithic 3D integration (M3D-IC) technology for realizing both robustness and In-memory Boolean logic compute support. The proposed two-layer design makes use of additional transistors over the SRAM layer to enable assist techniques as well as provide logic functions (such as AND/NAND, OR/NOR, XNOR/XOR) without degrading cell density. Through analysis, we provide insights into the benefits provided by three memory assist and two logic modes and evaluate the energy efficiency of our proposed design. Assist techniques improve SRAM read stability by 2.2x and increase the write margin by 17.6%, while staying within the SRAM footprint. By virtue of increased robustness, the cell enables seamless operation at lower supply voltages and thereby ensures energy efficiency. Energy Delay Product (EDP) reduces by 1.6x over standard 6T SRAM with a faster data access. Transistor placement and their biasing technique in layer-2 enables In-memory bitwise Boolean computation. When computing bulk In-memory operations, 6.5x energy savings is achieved as compared to computing outside the memory system.	biasing;bitwise operation;boolean algebra;cell (microprocessor);computation;data access;electronic data processing;exclusive or;logical connective;nand gate;robustness (computer science);seamless3d;static random-access memory;transistor;xnor gate	Srivatsa Rangachar Srinivasa;Akshay Krishna Ramanathan;Xueqing Li;Wei-Hao Chen;Fu-Kuo Hsueh;Chih-Chao Yang;Chang-Hong Shen;Jia-Min Shieh;Sumeet Kumar Gupta;Meng-Fan Chang;Swaroop Ghosh;Jack Sampson;Narayanan Vijaykrishnan	2018		10.1145/3218603.3218645	boolean algebra;static random-access memory;electronic engineering;transistor;nand gate;robustness (computer science);computer science;biasing;xnor gate;bitwise operation	EDA	16.69046021738277	59.890165255878244	192743

The proposed adaptive hardware presents two functional modes. The switch between these two is controlled by an evolutionary strategy with only objective the most efficient adaptation of the system's functionality. The choice of operational mode mainly depends on the density of faults that occur on the hardware. Simulation results have shown that our architecture is able to adapt the functionality of the sensor's electronics within the presence of permanent stuck-at faults that occur on the user and configuration memory of the system. Moreover, the analysis of the power consumption reveals that the electronics that are accomplished within our reconfigurable architecture consume significantly less power compared with equivalent circuits, which are designed within industrial FPGAs	autonomous robot;electronic circuit;evolvable hardware;field-programmable gate array;finite impulse response;gyroscope;self-balancing binary search tree;simulation	Evangelos F.

The gate that is implemented with threshold logic is called a threshold logic gate (TLG). Threshold gates are very fast and implement complex functionalities thus reducing the logic levels in the circuit implementation. Extensive research has been done in the development of suitable synthesis methodologies in the past, predominantly greedy. In this work, a synthesis methodology is proposed for increased fault tolerance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both in terms of resulting TLG count in the network implementation and reliability.	cmos;fault tolerance;greedy algorithm;logic gate;thesaurus linguae graecae	Manoj Kumar Goparaju;Ashok Kumar Palaniswamy;Spyros Tragoudas	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance of VLSI Systems	10.1109/DFT.2008.44	reliability engineering;and-or-invert;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;logic synthesis;real-time computing;logic optimization;logic gate;logic family;computer science;engineering;pass transistor logic;computer engineering	EDA	14.280204422590552	56.016124234827124	194866

Experimental data shows that these devices have potential for use in both memory and logic. This article describes the challenges faced in building crossbar array-based molecular memory and develops a methodology to optimize molecular scale architectures based on experimental device data taken at room temperature. In particular, issues in reading and writing such as memory using CMOS are discussed, and a solution is introduced for easily reading device conductivity states (typically characterized by very small currents). Additionally, a metric is derived to determine the voltages for writing to the crossbar array. The proposed memory design is also simulated with consideration to device parameter variations. Thus, the results presented here shed light on important design choices to be made at multiple abstraction levels, from devices to architectures.

In this work, we developed new design techniques called LGCS (locally gated clock signals) and EDCD (equally divided clock domains) to construct a low-power SR.

In particular, leakage power is becoming a dominant source of power consumption. In recent years, the reconfigurable single-electron transistor (SET) array has been proposed as an emerging circuit design style for continuing Moore's Law due to its ultra-low power consumption. Several automated synthesis techniques for area minimization have been developed for the reconfigurable SET array in the past few years. Nevertheless, most of those existing methods focus on variable and product term reordering during SET mapping. In fact, minimizing the number of product terms can greatly reduce the area as well, which has not been well addressed before. In this paper, we propose a dynamic shifting based variable ordering algorithm that can minimize the number of disjoint sum-of-product terms extracted from the given ROBDD. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve an area reduction of up to 49% as compared to current state-of-the-art techniques.	algorithm;binary decision diagram;cpu power dissipation;circuit design;disjunctive normal form;electron;electronic circuit;feasible region;moore's law;one-electron universe;power glove;spectral leakage;transistor	Yi-Hang Chen;Yang Chen;Juinn-Dar Huang	2015	VLSI Design, Automation and Test(VLSI-DAT)	10.1109/VLSI-DAT.2015.7114494	electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science	EDA	15.11588552024406	55.6471342648284	195850

However, a reckless use of bus layers may lead to an excessive number of wires and low-resource utilisation. To reduce such waste, researches have studied automated on-chip bus design methods for optimal architecture synthesis. This study expands the existing studies in two aspects. First, it considers all possible topologies and redefines the existing exploration problem, whereas the existing studies assume only a few types of topologies. Second, the study includes an exploration process based on a new on-chip bus protocol, system-on-chip network protocol (SNP), as well as processes based on existing protocols to solve the redefined problem. After the time complexity is investigated, it is found that the problem is NP-hard. Accordingly, this study proposes fast search algorithms that can be applied to each of the exploration steps. The proposed algorithms are implemented as a software program of exploration. The overall reduction ratio of the time complexity reaches about three millionths, with a maximal 16% increase in communication time (CT). Considering todays design life cycle, this seems to be a good trade-off.	communications protocol;network on a chip;system on a chip	Jaesung Lee	2012	IET Circuits, Devices & Systems	10.1049/iet-cds.2011.0054	time complexity;embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;np-hard	EDA	14.56523245016838	54.08468216241845	196026

The first question we address is whether horizontal and vertical channels should contain the same number of tracks (capacity), or if there is a density advantage with a directional bias. Secondly, should the channels have a uniform capacity, or is there an advantage when capacities vary from channel to channel? The key result is that the most area-efficient global routing architecture is one with uniform (or very nearly uniform) channel capacities across the entire chip in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Several non-uniform and directionally-biased architectures, however, are fairly area-efficient provided that appropriate choices are made for the pin positions on the logic blocks and the logic array aspect ratio.	bi-directional text;circuit complexity;field-programmable gate array;routing	Vaughn Betz;Jonathan Rose	1996	Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design	10.1145/244522.244948	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;macrocell array;logic gate;programmable logic array;computer science;engineering;programmable logic device;simple programmable logic device;field-programmable gate array	EDA	13.643805481313732	56.03754668999784	196203

Successful system operation at frequencies up to 400 MHz was achieved through careful static circuit design and timing optimization, along with the limited use of dynamic circuits for highly critical functions, and several different clocking/latching strategies for cycle time reduction. A variety of innovative full-custom circuit techniques were used in the dataflow design. Timing-driven synthesis of the control logic provided maximum flexibility with minimum turn-around time, while still matching the performance level set by the custom parts of the design. The on-chip LI cache was designed extensively with self-resetting CMOS (SRCMOS) circuitry to provide a 2.0 ns access time and up to 500 MHz operation.	cmos;microprocessor	James D. Warnock;Leon J.

fce57f7a7c5c1d0730fd873308e85f6fab1a46ae	"""special session on """"fault-tolerant techniques for computer systems, architectures and processors"""""""		As semiconductor technology scales, chips are becoming ever less reliable; prominent reasons for this phenomenon are the sheer number of transistors on a given silicon area and their shrinking device features. As a consequence, reliability is an increasing concern not only for safety-critical systems, but also for many other application domains in Embedded systems. However, traditional solutions for fault tolerance, e.g. provided through various redundancy schemes, have disproportionally increasing power and performance costs. This, in turn, limits substantially systems' efficiency, especially due to the fact that performance scaling and power are becoming significant design challenges, too. In the face of such changes in the technological landscape, this special session offers original contributions for fault-tolerant computer systems, architectures and processors, which address the above challenges.	central processing unit;computer	Ioannis Sourdis	2013		10.1109/SAMOS.2013.6621129	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;computer engineering	Arch	10.167842563113268	58.123881507701284	196598

The family features a new system architecture, significantly enhanced Core architecture [2], innovations in power management and modular design. The 4-core 8MB-L3-cache die has 731M transistors. We introduce a coherent point-to-point link called QuickPath Interconnect that is the foundation for coherent communication between IA processors, chipsets, I/O hubs and coprocessors/ accelerators for multiple generations. It features advanced power management, RAS capabilities and reduced hops/latency. At the physical level, it uses unidirectional variable-width differential signaling. The 45nm implementation features current-mode signaling with cascode driver, clock forwarding, source and sink termination, per-bit skew compensation and 2-tap driver equalization, as showin in Fig. 3.2.1.

0880573edf755ff4c353e858584b5af6e22eb0ff	cooperative encoding strategy for gate array placement on integrated circuits		With the rapid development of nanometer submicron technology, a delay from those related interconnect becomes the dominant factor of a chip performance. In recent years, the quadratic force-directed placement is becoming popular due to its stable quality at low power. The force-directed placement composes of two operations, namely, orientating and modulating. The two actions are going on until the overlap degree can meet a predetermined target. Different methods have a great influence on their quality of a layout. The article suggests a novel encoding strategy of two-dimensional chromosome based on Immune Cooperative Optimization. The main works first focus on that a multi-point crossover strategy, and its Poisson distribution makes use of a density Euclidean distance between the concentration of antibody suppression and the translation variation of optimal gene pair in two-dimension. Then a flexible region division is proposed for dealing with the layout problem of gate array. The result obtained through those comparative simulations and a related experiment indicates the constructed encoding strategy for gate array placement is effective and efficient.	euclidean distance;force-directed graph drawing;gate array;integrated circuit;simulation;zero suppression	Guangping Zeng;Xuyan Tu;Qingdong Su;Hongbo Wang	2018	2018 IEEE 17th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)	10.1109/ICCI-CC.2018.8482029	chip;gate array;encoding (memory);crossover;euclidean distance;logic gate;integrated circuit;interconnection;electronic engineering;computer science	EDA	14.202695701063691	53.52144409447093	197374

Such technology promises lower latency, lower power consumption and a smaller footprint as compared to planar ICs. Reducing the overall 3D-SIC manufacturing cost is a major challenge driving the industry. The process of stacking the dies together is an integral part of 3D-SIC manufacturing process; hence, it impacts the overall cost. This paper introduces out-of-order stacking and compares it with the conventional in-order stacking from cost point of view. In-order stacking restricts the stacking of the dies in a bottom-up sequential order, while out-of-order stacking poses no restrictions and the order is free as long as it is realistic. The simulation results show that out-of-order stacking ends up in lower cost than in-order stacking, and that the difference increases for larger stack sizes and lower stacking yield. For example, our case study shows that for a 3D-SIC with a stack size of 6 layers, out-of-order stacking outperforms the in-order one with up to 6% using the optimal test flow.	die (integrated circuit);floor and ceiling functions;focus stacking;point of view (computer hardware company);simplified instructional computer;simulation;stack overflow;wafer (electronics)	Mottaqiallah Taouil;Said Hamdioui	2011	14th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems	10.1109/DDECS.2011.5783107	structural engineering;three-dimensional space;packaging and labeling;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;out-of-order execution;stacking;top-down and bottom-up design;software testing;engineering drawing	Arch	13.336423448148928	58.5958797834367	197553

In this paper, we present a technique for improving device mobility in the critical path via global STI well width adjusting following the chip placement stage. The methodology formulates the original device mobility enhancement problem as a series of convex geometric programs(GP), which is based on two observations that: (1)Minimum layout perturbation objective could be reached when introducing into an iterative GP approximation procedure; (2)Terms in charge of PMOS channel mobility optimization could be modeled as posynomials of design variables, that is, the width of STI wells. Finally, by applying the presented technique to several IBM-PLACE benchmarks, and solving the resulted GP problems by a GP solver named MOSEK, we are able to demonstrate its effectiveness.	approximation;critical path method;geometric programming;iterative method;mosek;mathematical optimization;pmos logic;posynomial;solver;transistor	Jing Li;Bo Yang;Qing Dong;Shigetoshi Nakatake	2010	Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537398	chip;layout;programming;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;geometric programming;computer science;engineering;critical path method;mathematics;stress;engineering drawing	EDA	16.250559196551745	53.80771335345796	198082

The placement problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), subject to the constraints on mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for the pads and the voltage drop in the power grid. To improve the performance of the optimizer, the pad placement problem is solved based on the divide-and-conquer principle, and the locality properties of the power grid are exploited by modeling the distant nodes and sources coarsely, following the coarsening stage in multigrid-like approach. An accurate electromigration (EM) model that captures current crowding and Joule heating effects is developed and integrated with our C4 placement approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on several designs adapted from publicly released benchmarks.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);crowding;electromigration;flip chip;joule;linear programming;locality of reference;mathematical optimization;mean time between failures;multigrid method;power supply;very-large-scale integration	Pingqiang Zhou;Vivek Mishra;Sachin S.

A first realization in 0.18-/spl mu/m partially depleted (PD) silicon-on-insulator (SOI), using complex branch-based logic (BBL) cells, results in a delay of 720 ps and a power dissipation of 96 mW at 1.5 V. The reduction of the stack height in the critical path, combined with the optimization of the global carry network with cell sharing and the selection of 8-bit pre-sums, leads to a reduction of the power-delay product by 75%. The automatic tuning of the transistor widths in 0.13-/spl mu/m PD SOI produces an energy-efficient 64-bit adder which has a delay of 326 ps and a power dissipation of 23 mW only at 1.1 V.	64-bit computing;8-bit;adder (electronics);cmos;cpl;cpu power dissipation;critical path method;fan-out;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;power–delay product;principle of abstraction;shape optimization;silicon on insulator;topological insulator;transistor	Amaury Nève;Helmut Schettler;Thomas Ludwig;Denis Flandre	2004	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems		embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;dissipation;adder	EDA	15.644296634506368	55.94587967324452	198953

Complex rf- and mixed-signal system-on-chip designs require accurate prediction early in the design schedule, and time-to-market pressures dictate that design iterations be kept to a minimum. Signal integrity is seen as a key issue in typical applications, requiring very accurate interconnect transmission-line modeling and RLC extraction of parasitic effects. To enable this, IBM has in place a mature project infrastructure consisting of predictive device models, complete rf characterization, statistical and scalable compact models that are hardware-verified, and a robust design automation environment. Finally, the unit and integration testing of all of these components is performed thoroughly. This paper describes each of these aspects and provides an overview of associated development work.	bicmos;cmos;silicon-germanium	David L. Harame;Kim M. Newton;Raminderpal Singh;Susan L.

In reversible gates, there is a unique, one-to-one mapping between the inputs and outputs, not the case with conventional logic. One of the primary motivations for adopting reversible logic lies in the fact that it can provide a logic design methodology for designing ultra-low power circuits beyond KTln2 limit for those emerging nanotechnologies in which the energy dissipated due to information destruction will be a significant factor of the overall heat dissipation. Further, logic circuits for quantum computers must be built from reversible logic components. Several important metrics need to be considered in the design of reversible circuits the importance of which needs to be discussed. Quantum computers of many qubits are extremely difficult to realize thus the number of qubits in the quantum circuits needs to be minimized. This sets the major objective of optimizing the number of ancilla inputs and the number of the garbage outputs in the reversible logic based quantum circuits. The constant input in the reversible quantum circuit is called the ancilla input, while the garbage output refers to the output which exists in the circuit just to maintain one-to-one mapping but is not a primary or a useful output. The reversible circuit has other important parameters of quantum cost and delay which need to be optimized.	ancilla bit;automata theory;computer;existential quantification;logic gate;nanocomputer;one-to-one (data model);optical computing;programming paradigm;quantum cellular automaton;quantum circuit;quantum computing;quantum dot cellular automaton;qubit;reversible computing;thermal management (electronics)	Himanshu Thapliyal;N.
