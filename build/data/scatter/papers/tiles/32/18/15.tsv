24e02b8fda1a944f73a624a80c4ca7dfeebcb4ab	optimization of movement of the aircraft on taxiway area	shortest path taxiway holding time taxiing time;optimization model aircraft movement optimization taxiway area optimization process flight number first come first served principle conflict avoidance taxiing time shortest path principle maximum allowable holding time minimum separation distance bali ngurah rai airport;aircraft optimization atmospheric modeling airports logic gates mathematical model bismuth;optimisation air traffic control aircraft control airports motion control	The purpose of this study is to develop model to optimize the movement of the aircraft on taxiway area. The optimization process is carried out on a number of flights over a period of time and is performed sequentially between one flight to the next flight with the principle of first come first served. Optimization is based on the principle of choosing the shortest path between the start and end of the movement of aircraft on the taxiway area, taking into account the holding time which may result due to avoiding any conflict in the taxiway area. The best path is the one with the minimum total taxiing time and holding time within a set of alternative paths. Set is determined by the shortest path principle. Optimization is limited by the maximum allowable holding time, as well as minimum separation distance between aircrafts on the taxiway area. The proposed algorithm is applied on an illustrative example of case of Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport. Results show that the optimization model could provide a better total time than the one of current practice.	airport security;algorithm;instrument flight rules;mathematical optimization;shortest path problem;standard operating procedure	Tri Tjahjono;Nahry;Novy Husaeny	2014	2014 International Conference on Advanced Logistics and Transport (ICALT)	10.1109/ICAdLT.2014.6866333	simulation	EDA	14.038409705507314	0.37361300708557393	146434

Recently, a variety of annual reconfiguration planning methods considering energy loss have been studied. However, no conventional methods address the reconfiguration periods in fine granularity. Practically, switch durability does not support high-frequency switching. Therefore, this paper proposes a new optimization method for annual reconfiguration scheduling. This method determines switch configurations and their reconfiguration periods with a constraint on the permissible reconfiguration times. In addition, this paper reveals the annual energy loss reduction effect of this optimization. Our method is based on partial network optimization with exhaustive enumeration of all feasible configurations. Experiments were conducted using a standard Japanese distribution network model with 468 switches. The results show that optimizing the reconfiguration periods reduces energy loss by up to 2.1 times, relative to that in a simulated conventional operation, which considers reconfiguration at equal intervals. We believe that this is the first quantitative report to address the difference between optimal reconfiguration scheduling and conventional reconfiguration.	durability (database systems);experiment;mathematical optimization;network model;network switch;scheduling (computing);token reconfiguration	Yuji Takenobu;Norihito Yasuda;Shunsuke Kawano;Shin-ichi Minato;Yasuhiro Hayashi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2604922	reliability engineering;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;mathematics	Arch	12.277574164590291	2.7266277653843143	146960

Our proposed formulation combines the Team Orienteering Problem with the case of Pick-up and Delivery with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints. We solved this model to optimality using an exact Branch-and-Price method, which is based on previous work. To study the performance of the solution method and its refinements, we conducted extensive computational experiments. We also applied the proposed model and method to a relevant logistic system and investigated its performance under various conditions. Finally, we present a practical method to determine the most suitable fleet configuration for a pick-up and delivery system that delivers prioritized operations to a known client base.	microsoft windows	D.

This problem combines aspects of precision agriculture and optimization with the purpose of achieving a site and time specific management of the field properties that is consistent and effective in time for a medium term horizon. More specifically, we propose a two stage integer stochastic linear programming model with recource that solves the problem of generating a partition facing a finite number of future scenarios, with a solution that gives satisfactory results to any possible value of the chosen soil property. We describe the proposed model, the adopted methodology and the results achieved with this methodology.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;column generation;linear programming;mathematical optimization;partition problem;programming model;spatial variability	Jose L.

7670cc412f5c069479de7b5d64ba75f9bca3dac5	the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem with flexible compartment sizes	multiple compartments;vehicle routing;variable neighborhood search;heuristics;glass waste collection	In this paper, a capacitated vehicle routing problem is discussed which occurs in the context of glass waste collection. Supplies of several different product types (glass of different colors) are available at customer locations. The supplies have to be picked up at their locations and moved to a central depot at minimum cost. Different product types may be transported on the same vehicle, however, while being transported they must not be mixed. Technically this is enabled by a specific device, which allows for separating the capacity of each vehicle individually into a limited number of compartments where each compartment can accommodate one or several supplies of the same product type. For this problem, a model formulation and a variable neighborhood search algorithm for its solution are presented. The performance of the proposed heuristic is evaluated by means of extensive numerical experiments. Furthermore, the economic benefits of introducing compartments on the vehicles are investigated.	color;experiment;heuristic;local search (optimization);multi-compartment model;numerical analysis;product type;search algorithm;variable neighborhood search;vehicle routing problem	Tino Henke;Maria Grazia Speranza;Gerhard Wäscher	2015	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2015.05.020	mathematical optimization;operations management;heuristics;vehicle routing problem;mathematics	AI	15.996136216668443	1.8568014086183953	148204

There have been numerous studies considering m jobs on one processor which consider various cost factors such as the total penalty cost. One of the important, but less investigated cost factors, in the previous studies, is the inventory carrying and its relevant capital costs. The inventory costs such as the holding cost and capital cost must be considered in proposing a solution to the sequencing problem. In this paper, by taking those costs into account to address the sequencing problem, a developed slope order index is computed to enable decision makers to a sufficient cost saving sequence of m jobs on one processor. This paper contributes the current knowledge by proposing a new sequencing solution in which some previously less observed costs are considered. The result of this paper can also be employed in scheduling of m jobs where there is a bottleneck and the inventories are expensive or their holding costs are considerable.

This is despite the fact that the inherent variability causes an accumulation of work-in-process (WIP) at the various stages of production which eventually affects competing strategies of a manufacturing enterprise such as time, cost and quality. Therefore, an integrated methodology that incorporates the manufacturing variability and concurrently optimises the layout design and MHS is discussed in this paper. Queuing model is utilised to model the manufacturing system variations and genetic algorithm has been implemented to solve the integrated optimisation problem. It is also demonstrated that the proposed integrated optimisation approach can significantly improve a production system with respect to total travelling time, total WIP in the system, utilisation and quantity of material handling equipment and required area.	genetic algorithm;material handling;mathematical optimization;production system (computer science);spatial variability;tree accumulation	Dhamodharan Raman	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	10.1109/IEEM.2011.6118018	genetic algorithm;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management;queueing theory;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	10.573261824885947	3.182281202998454	148913
d584debab5ccd0ca3a86d969c8287c662ea14ee0	an advanced grasp-hga combination to solve a multi-period pickup and delivery problem		Abstract This paper introduces an advanced GRASP-HGA combination for the multi-period Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Paired Demands (Mu-PDPTWPD). This variant is an extension of well-known pick up and delivery problem (PDP) where a fleet of vehicles must satisfy a given number of transportation requests subject to many constraints. We include the multi-period aspect to our variant to match real-world applications where sites can be visited by a vehicle in one or several periods. In this study, we aim at minimizing simultaneously the total traveled distance needed for vehicles to satisfy all requests and the penalty involved by serving a site lately. Computational results on benchmark instances are finally provided in order to show the efficiency of the proposed method.	grasp;hercules graphics card	Zaher Al-Chami;Hervé Manier;Marie-Ange Manier;Elias Chebib	2018	Expert Syst.

There is a multitude of variants of this problem varying according to problem characteristics and assumptions. Routing is guided by multiple objectives and affected by different context factors. This paper formulates a vehicle routing optimization model allowing for incorporation of arbitrary selected context factors and objectives represented by KPI. In order to assess relative importance of the objectives and context factors, an adaptive approach is proposed. Experimental studies are conducted to illustrate application of the model and the adaptation method.	mathematical optimization;vehicle routing problem	Janis Grabis;Vineta Minkevica	2017		10.7148/2017-0235	wireless routing protocol;dynamic source routing;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway protocol;computer network;path vector protocol;static routing;zone routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;computer science	Robotics	16.418558456487823	0.7222634794713845	149263

III IV Abstract In the automotive industry, a manufacturer must perform several hundreds of tests on prototypes of a vehicle before starting its mass production. These tests must be allocated to suitable prototypes and ordered to satisfy temporal constraints and various kinds of test dependencies. To reduce costs, the manufacturer is interested in using the minimum number of prototypes. We apply Constraint Programming (CP) and a hybrid approach to solve the scheduling problem. Our CP method can achieve good feasible solutions even for our largest instances within a reasonable time. In comparison with existing methods, we can improve the solutions for most of our instances and reduce …	code;computer cluster;constraint programming;ilog;industrial engineering;logistics;micro bill systems;scheduling (computing);software prototyping	Kamol Limtanyakul	2009			simulation;engineering;operations management;scheduling;manufacturing engineering	AI	12.832596281067401	1.6414509804031425	149281
dbf4773936eb35a6524f6a7791ea175fb8b41b48	optimising routing in an agent-centric synchromodal network with shared information		This thesis is part of the NWO research project: “Complexity Methods for Predictive Synchromodality” [140]. This program is aimed at innovative and multidisciplinary research to create new ideas for complex logistic systems. The complexity of the systems arises from the interaction between subsystems and the variability in the systems themselves. The research for this project has been done at TNO, in the department Cyber Security and Robustness. The mission of TNO is to connect people and knowledge to create innovations that boost the competitive strength of industry and the well-being of society in a sustainable way. Our research focuses on synchromodal planning problems. A synchromodal system is a multimodal network in which logistic service providers have the opportunity to switch mode of transport of containers based on real-time data. This means that customers need to book amodally and the information within this multimodal network is shared to all agents. The planning problems that arise due to this added flexibility are synchromodal planning problems. First, we perform an extensive literature study that describes research concerning synchromodal planning problems. We divide this research into strategic, tactical and operational planning. Research on operational planning is scarce, therefore our research focuses on this aspect. For synchromodal planning problems a framework categorising this research does not yet exist and therefore we will develop such a framework. Furthermore, we develop two different models of synchromodal systems. We focus on a synchromodal transportation system in which information is shared between all agents in the system. Here all agents are “selfish”, i.e. choosing routes based on an individual optimisation objective. Information can be public, i.e. known to everybody in the network or private, i.e. information that belongs to a certain agent which needs to be willing to share this information. One of our models is an analytic model that relies on certain assumptions. This model is static in nature and therefore, not all aspects from real life cases are encompassed in this model. However, even with simplifications the analytic model is too computationally heavy. The other model is a simulation-based model, which can handle more realistic instances. We also develop four different methods to determine the optimal paths in such an agent-centric synchromodal network. We develop two simulation-based heuristics and two other simulation-based solution algorithms. The heuristics only act on public information, i.e. information about the congestion on the roads. The simulation-based models also act on private information, i.e. information about upcoming orders. The two heuristics and one of the simulation-based methods are then tested on a synchromodal network and on two smaller examples. The small examples show that there are instances in which the simulation-based solution algorithm outperforms the two heuristics. This means that the addition of private information can decrease costs. However, in the large synchromodal network the differences between the different methods vanish and each model determines routes that result in similar costs. This means that the type of network and the network parameters determine whether the additional information is useful.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;complexity;glossary of computer graphics;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;network congestion;personally identifiable information;real life;real-time clock;real-time data;routing;simulation;spatial variability;vanish (computer science);whole earth 'lectronic link	Myrte A.

This function represents the economical costs of the systems. However, there are other planning aspects that should be considered but they can not be expressed in terms of costs; therefore, they need to be formulated as separate objective functions. This paper presents a new multi-objective planning method for power distribution systems. The method is based on the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2. The edge-set encoding technique and the constrain-domination concept were applied to handle the problem constraints. The method was tested on a real large-scale system with two objective functions: economical cost and energy non-supplied. From these results, it can be said that the proposed method is suitable to resolve the multi-objective problem of large-scale power distribution system expansion planning.	approximation algorithm;converge;convex set;dominating set;evolutionary algorithm;loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency	Francisco Rivas-Dávalos;Malcolm R.

c6ff9fdacdc58ecbfc55f202d234a5d96b6350a5	bike fleet allocation models for repositioning in bike-sharing systems		Public bike-sharing systems provide an alternative transportation method and have been rapidly implemented throughout the world in recent years. Using these systems, individuals can find a bike station near their location, rent a bike for free or at a low cost and then ride to another station near their destination. This paper studies how to determine the number of bikes to be deployed at each station during bike repositioning in bike-sharing systems. The goal is to maximize the time interval between repositioning events, which occur when the demand for renting or returning a bike is not satisfied, or to maximize the satisfaction of demands within a fixed time interval between two repositioning events. To achieve these goals, two mathematical programming models are developed, and a numerical example is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed models.	mathematical optimization;numerical analysis	Qun Chen;Mei Liu;Xinyu Liu	2018	IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine	10.1109/MITS.2017.2776129	renting;simulation;mathematical model;resource management;engineering;resource allocation	ML	12.912024866956816	0.7495550395381196	149613

24be73c5043d5502e5feacc4c87405c5cd39c2bb	comparing algorithms for minimizing congestion and cost in the multi-commodity k-splittable flow		In the k-splittable flow problem, each commodity can only use at most k paths and the key point is to find the suitable transmitting paths for each commodity. To guarantee the efficiency of the network, minimizing congestion is important, but it is not enough, the cost consumed by the network is also needed to minimize. Most researches restrict to congestion or cost, but not the both. In this paper, we consider the bi-objective (minimize congestion, minimize cost) k-splittable problem. We propose three different heuristic algorithms for this problem, 1 A , 2 A and 3 A . Each algorithm finds paths for each commodity in a feasible splittable flow, and the only difference between these algorithms is the initial feasible flow. We compare the three algorithms by testing instances, showing that choosing suitable initial feasible flow is important for obtaining good results.	algorithm;flow network;heuristic;network congestion;transmitter	Chengwen Jiao;Suixiang Gao;Wenguo Yang	2015	Computer and Information Science	10.5539/cis.v8n2p1	mathematical optimization;minimum-cost flow problem	Theory	16.681596175687638	2.727296591468259	149938

(optimisation stratégique et tactique en logistique urbaine)		Solving Strategic and Tactical Optimization Problems in City Logistics Urban freight transport is a matter of increasing concern in the economic, commercial, social and environmental operations of our cities, due to the constantly increasing growth and urbanization of the civilization. An improved management of the traffic related to the freight transport can have a positive impact in many respects: security, congestion of the road network, noise and air pollution, costs. City Logistics studies the dynamic management of urban freight transport in order to deliver distribution systems solutions that may be suitable for both the community and freight carriers. This thesis originates from the ANR Project MODUM, which proposes a freight distribution system based on a ring of Urban Distribution Centers (UDCs) located in the outskirts of a city. In the first part, this system is studied from both a strategic and a tactical point of view. The Multicommodity-Ring Location Routing Problem (MRLRP) considers long-term decisions, i.e. the installation of the UDCs and the ring connection, without disregarding more tactical aspects. The MRLRP has been tackled by three solution methods, which proved effective on a large set of test instances. In the second part of the thesis, the Vehicle Routing Problem with Intermediate Replenishment Facilities (VRPIRF) is studied. The VRPIRF is a more tactical problem that arises in City Logistics each time both the multi-trip and the multi-depot features, i.e. the possibility for a vehicle to be reloaded at one of a set of facilities, are present. Several exact algorithms, namely two of type Branch&Cut and two of type Branch& Price, have been developed for this problem. Computational experiments on benchmark instances taken from the literature have been conducted to assess their performance, leading to very promising results.	algorithm;ambiguous name resolution;assignment problem;benchmark (computing);computation;computational complexity theory;experiment;logistics;mathematical optimization;network congestion;vehicle routing problem	Paolo Gianessi	2014				AI	16.002661896099273	1.1650551592684535	150505

This procedure is based on the interactive goal programming model and the concept of satisfaction functions which are used to elucidate and integrate explicitly the decision-maker's preferences. A record-to-record travel (RRT) technique is adapted to solve this new interactive goal programming model. The proposed approach provides a satisfactory solution in the presence of conflicting objectives with a minimum distance from the fixed goals.

A numerical experiment was tested. The results show that the algorithm is feasible with high computing efficiency, and generates solutions very close to optimal solution.	algorithm;cargo cult programming;covering problems;decision problem;decision support system;feasible region;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;np-hardness;numerical analysis;optimization problem;programming model;recursion;semiconductor consolidation;set cover problem	Yunmiao Gui;Bengang Gong;Youming Cheng	2008	2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2008.125	mathematical optimization;simulation;operations management;mathematics	EDA	16.65243939521043	-0.20426835299540377	151028

An integrated scheduling problem of supply and distribution operations in a make-to-order supply chain is considered. The supply chain consists of contracted suppliers, capacitated processing centers, and many demand points. Processing centers customize and/or configure semi-finished products supplied by suppliers to finished products in terms of the requirements of demand points: order quantity and delivery deadline. The problem is to find the assignment of both suppliers and demand points to processing centers and the schedules for supply and distribution operations such that the total costs of shipping and penalty that unfulfilled customer orders incur are minimized, subject to network capacity and deadline constraints. In this paper, a heuristic algorithm is developed, based on partial relaxation and median threshold, which makes it possible to avoid dealing with the generalized assignment problem, a strongly NP-hard problem, in the solution process. Computational tests are performed over test cases randomly generated to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. As compared to the use of commercial optimization package, CPLEX, computational results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find a good near-optimal solution to this problem with remarkably less computational time.	scheduling (computing)	Gang Wang;Lei Lei	2015	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2015.03.015	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;engineering;operations management	Robotics	14.428476037966051	3.5532603166923327	152146

Deterministic models are usually simpler, more easily understood, and less data intensive. However, stochastic models tend to be more realistic, but require significant data to develop a realistic model. We illustrate that when queueing is a defining property of the problem semantics then we need suitable data and a model that allows us to describe and characterise the relationship between the queueing process, its parameters and delay. By comparing an analytic deterministic model with a stochastic simulation of an orthopaedic Integrated Clinical Assessment and Treatment Service, we show that when uncertainty is ignored in the planning stages then there will be a deficiency in the number of staff allocated. This causes queues to build up and it follows that patients will receive a diminished quality of care.

Coordinating inventory and transportation policies can lead to substantial cost savings and improved service levels especially when the companies relay on third-party logistics providers to transport the products across the supply chain. In this paper, therefore focus has been given on a supply chain system of multi-supplier, single warehouse and multi-retailer with backlogging and transportation capacity. The paper aims to suggest replenishment policies that can minimize system-wide cost by taking advantage of quantity discounts in the transportation cost structures. The problem considered in this paper has been formulated as an integer programming model. The supply chain problem is usually complex and involves massive calculations hence it is difficult to obtain an optimal solution. Therefore, to overcome this issue a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach has been suggested to resolve the problem. The computational results demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the GA in optimizing replenishment policies. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

b06b5c85b00dcfff174171471f97dbb8d5086354	an emsr-based approach for revenue management with integrated upgrade decisions	revenue management;capacity control;emsr;upgrades	We consider the revenue management problem of capacity control with integrated upgrade decisionmaking. The dynamic programming formulation of this problem is hard to solve to optimality, even in the single-leg case, because multiple hierarchical resource types must be considered simultaneously. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new heuristic approach that generalizes the idea behind the wellknown single-leg EMSR-a procedure to multiple resource types. Similar to EMSR-a, our approach is based on the computation of protection levels, but additionally allows for the integrated consideration of upgrades. In addition, we derive control policies for typical demand arrival patterns. As an extension, we propose a generalization of our approach that allows for arbitrarily ordered prices with respect to the upgrade hierarchy. Furthermore, we perform a number of computational experiments to investigate the performance of the new approach compared to other capacity control methods that incorporate upgrades. We consider typical airlines0 single-leg scenarios with 10 (re)optimizations throughout the booking horizon. The results show that our approach can significantly outperform existing methods in terms of the total achieved revenue, including dynamic programming decomposition approaches that are proposed in literature, as well as successive planning approaches that are widely used in commercial revenue management systems. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately the objective is hard to be measured since commodity information of down-line stations is unavailable. In order to solve this problem a rule based optimization approach is proposed in this paper. The approach is a heuristic described by rule flow, which is constructed by high-level business logic and optimization algorithms. Based on such approach, a system with a visual rule editor, a business object modeler and a rule engine was developed and implemented in a North American airline. The flexibility, stability and efficiency of the system were illustrated by real cases studies from the client. And the client’s operation results had proved the system can help the client save about $84 Million per year on fuel consumption and improve its ground operation efficiency.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;automated planning and scheduling;business logic;business object;business process;business rules engine;computation;constraint satisfaction;heuristic;high- and low-level;information system;ka band;lu decomposition;lecture notes in computer science;machine learning;mathematical optimization;mitchell corporation;natural computing;optimization problem;optimizing compiler;portable document format;process modeling;shadow volume;springer (tank);tabu search;wildfly	Feng Li;Chunhua Tian;Hao Zhang;Wade Kelley	2010		10.1016/j.procs.2010.04.161	rule-based system;mathematical optimization;simulation;object model;computer science;fuel efficiency;programming language;satisfiability	AI	14.418559862817924	1.1352075883900046	152503
a4f698acf8807f10d0208db043dd94d708652071	a heuristic approach to fragmentation incorporating query information	allocation;relational databases;fragmentation;cost model	Fragmentation and allocation are database distribution design techniques used to improve the system performance by increasing data localisation and reducing data transportation costs between different network sites. Often fragmentation and allocation are considered separately, disregarding that they are using the same input information to achieve the same objective. Vertical fragmentation is often considered a complicated problem, because the huge number of alternatives make it nearly impossible to obtain an optimal solution. Therefore, many researchers seek for heuristic solutions, among which affinity-based vertical fragmentation approaches form a main stream in the literature. However, using attribute affinities to perform fragmentation can not really reflect the local needs of data at each site. Therefore it is not guaranteed that the remote data transportation costs can be reduced. This paper addresses vertical fragmentation and allocation simultaneously in the context of the relational data model. The core of the paper is a heuristic approach to vertical fragmentation, which uses a cost model and is targeted at globally minimising these costs. Further, based on the proposed vertical fragmentation, an integrated methodology is proposed by applying vertical and horizontal fragmentation simultaneously to produce mixed fragmentation schemata.	fragmentation (computing);heuristic	Hui Ma;Klaus-Dieter Schewe;Markus Kirchberg	2006			computer science;operations management;data mining;database;fragmentation	NLP	11.266069483965495	0.13245151888162807	152526

Business matchmaking scheduling seeks to maximize the total number of appointments with the maximum objective that weighs the preferences of both buyers and sellers. In this paper, the authors transformed the business matchmaking scheduling problem into a 3-dimensional planar assignment problem and solved it heuristically using a series of bipartite maximum weighted maximum cardinality matching problems. Simulation experiments and real data showed that this algorithm outperforms human experts and prior algorithm in terms of number of appointments, the objective that weighs buyer and sellerâ€™s preferences, and the execution time.	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);optimizing compiler;scheduling (computing)	Yingping Huang;Xihui Zhang;Paulette S.

One characteristic model that considers the combination of human and machine resource constraints is called dual resource constrained (DRC). In this context a number of machines nmach is managed by a selection of operators nop, with typically nop ≤ nmach.. A real life case study for an Italian manufacturing company is introduced that uses a set of identical parallel machines being operated by a set of operators. Each job is scheduled to one machine with corresponding loading and unloading process times. A simulated annealing approach is proposed to solve the DRC job shop scheduling problem. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for a selection of algorithm-specific parameters used to solve characteristic DRC layouts. Being characteristic for the just-in-time (JIT) production environment, the high variability in job times has also been taken into account. The results show that the selected layout nmach./nop ratio strongly influences the production system performance. The impact of the ratio of constrained resources has been analysed for different layouts, showing that simulated annealing performs better for single resource constrained problems while also demonstrating that this trend is not symmetrical for different layouts, either operator or machine constrained.	algorithm;deployment environment;heart rate variability;job shop scheduling;just-in-time compilation;nop;production system (computer science);real life;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing	Maurizio Faccio;Jana Ries;Nicola Saggiorno	2015	IJMOR	10.1504/IJMOR.2015.072274	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;flow shop scheduling;simulated annealing;computer science;operations management;mathematics;manufacturing;scheduling	AI	13.991525612988962	3.9479737900468055	152961
b9bebfeed4e7886b932571dee1011a9402c3f658	a novel method to handle route failure in fuzzy vehicle routing problem with hard time windows and uncertain demand		In this paper, a fuzzy vehicle routing problem with hard time windows (FVRPTW) having uncertain demand is addressed. Since customeru0027s demand is assumed to be known only upon arrival at customer location, a planned route may fail to meet realised demand of customer. This situation is known as route failure. Instead of adopting simple recourse methods to handle route failure, this paper proposes a novel method titled u0027non-restockingu0027 to solve route failure. The problem is formulated as a two stage recourse model with an objective of minimising the total cost and at the same time maximising the obtained sale in a competitive environment. Uncertainty in demand is represented by fuzzy numbers. Route construction for the modelled problem is done by ant colony system. The computational results show that the proposed two stage model with the proposed new recourse scheme produces high quality solutions. Benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated by applying it to milk routing problem.	hard time;microsoft windows;vehicle routing problem	Sandhya Bansal;Rajeev Kumar Goel;Vijay Katiyar	2017	IJAOM	10.1504/IJAOM.2017.10009338	fuzzy logic;total cost;mathematical optimization;operations management;engineering;vehicle routing problem;real-time computing;fuzzy number	Robotics	15.285540204570488	1.2899411475013687	153705

9cf5bb2e78afab4d05d107c2ca5e3101e19ca774	team selection using multi-/many-objective optimization with integer linear programming		Assembling a competitive team is a task encountered in many professional league sports such as cricket, soccer, rugby etc. Teams are assembled annually with players being bid for by competing franchises. While stochastic optimization approaches for team selection have been suggested in the past, the approximate nature of these techniques could be disadvantageous for team selection when the stakes are high. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-objective integer programming approach to alleviate this issue and deliver a set of optimal trade-off solutions (teams). We illustrate the performance of the approach using professional Twenty20 cricket league data from the Indian Premier League. We also demonstrate the ability to support partial team construction, i.e., selecting few members of the team with others unchanged. Lastly, we also present a way to rank the importance of the players within a team considering the key objectives.	approximation algorithm;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;scalability;stochastic optimization	Shelvin Chand;Hemant Kumar Singh;Tapabrata Ray	2018	2018 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2018.8477945	machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science;task analysis;stochastic optimization;integer programming;linear programming	Robotics	13.768557928561993	-2.514468313609233	153758

A procedure is presented for combined allocation of these two kinds of personal presence. Allocation of a physician's time to direct diagnosis versus telediagnosis is an example. The purpose of a transportation system is to allocate people's direct presence by moving them about in physical space. The purpose of a communication system is to allocate people's vicarious presence by modifying interconnection of communication channels, assuming that appropriate parties are bodily located at the terminals of the communication channel. Thus a person can speak or manipulate directly while being bodily located with the person or machine which is the object of his actions; or he can speak or manipulate vicariously over a communication channel while being bodily located elsewhere. Because of the trading relation between direct and vicarious presence in terms of cost factors like dollars, time, energy, and personal well-being, efforts to optimize transportation systems ought to include communication systems and vice versa. An optimization procedure is suggested below. It is concerned with allocating direct or vicarious presence at a discrete set of nodes in physical space at discrete times. The technique presupposes, as every optimization procedure necessarily presupposes, a unique utility function which is to be maximized. Initially let us assume knowledge of several kinds of economic data is available in quantitative form. UTILITY FUNCTIONS Assume a network consisting of nodes n, n = 1,2,.. *,N, locations in physical space. Divide time t into intervals t = 1,2, .,T. Assume the following quantities are specified: 1) D(t,n), the utility of being directly present or attending to the environment local to one's body at time t at node n, 2) V(t,m), the utility of being vicariously present by attending through a communication channel at time t to node m, m = 1,2,.. .,N, while being physically present at node n (note that presence here refers to locus of attention m, while physical location of the body is elsewhere), 3) T(r,n,rm), the cost of traveling from n to m by a transportation means which takes r intervals of time for the trip, 4) C(n,m), the cost of communicating from n to m. D and V must be set by subjective appraisal. T and C are usually dictated by going rates for transportation and communication. Example As an illustration, consider the problem of a physician specialist whose practice consists of advising patients in 15-minute interviews. Assume he is available in person (direct presence) in one of two offices (spatial nodes) or is on call by telephone through his receptionist (vicarious presence) wherever he is. Further assume that in this particular practice patients are satisfied by one interview, so that the value of the physician's services is strictly a function of time of day and whether the interview is in person or by telephone. In the form described later the optimization procedure is not amenable to situations where value changes as a function of time spent at a given node. Ekamples of D and V are given in Fig. 1, where node 1 might be a factory clinic where workers can come only during certain hours. Node 2 might be the physician's regular office, where expected demand is less than at factory peak hours and tapers off with time of day. Node 3 is shown to have insignificant utility for direct prosManuscript received August 4, 1969; revised March 17, 1970.

Therefore, in this paper, in order to model the case of trips for tourist groups, we introduce a new problem, as an extension of the existing problem in the literature that is used for planning the trip of a single tourist. The new problem extends the existing problem with two additional concepts. The first is the consideration of multiple tourists, where their individual preferences about points of interests are taken into account, and the second is the introduction of the concept of mutual social relationship between the different tourists. For the actual single tourist trip problem, we use an algorithm that obtains comparable results with the state of the art algorithms, whereas for the group trip problem, since no solution has been published before, we design a new algorithm based on tabu search metaheuristic that uses two new unique operators for exploring the search space. As a result, this paper proposes an anytime algorithm that in average takes about 20 s to obtain better personalized itineraries for tourist groups than when scheduling the whole group together.

e9f9316016d19342f2ebecf63601a17e049ad670	giving formal roles to elevators for breaking symmetry in static elevator operation problems		In this paper, we propose a technique to decrease computational times in solving an integer linear programming (ILP) model for the static elevator operation problem (SEOP). The SEOP is a problem to optimally operate elevators on such assumption that all information on passengers who use an elevator system is known beforehand. In planning, there is a symmetry on elevators that exchanging 2 elevators does not affect the value of the objective function, if initial states of those elevators are identical. Such symmetry requires much computational times for problems to be solved, since there are at least 2 optimal solutions which differ only in allocations of elevators and partial solutions for those solutions can not be bound. That symmetry is resolved by giving different roles to elevators, and those roles are assignment pattern numbers (APNs) in the proposed technique. An APN of an elevator is a decimal number which is calculated from a binary vector which represents assignments of passengers to that elevator. The proposed technique deploys such a straightforward fact that all elevators have different APNs, and enfoces an elevator with a smaller index to have a smaller APN than other elevators with larger indexes. The effectiveness of that technique is numerically examined by applying a mathematical solver to ILP equations generated from some problem instances.	algebraic petri net;automated planning and scheduling;bit array;computation;elevator algorithm;integer programming;linear programming;loss function;numerical analysis;optimization problem;solver	Tsutomu Inamoto;Yoshinobu Higami;Shin-ya Kobayashi	2015	2015 IEEE 4th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2015.7398534	control engineering;simulation;control theory;mathematics	EDA	16.87548928412032	3.590742040931669	155280

It can be described as the combination of vehiclerouting and inventory management problems, in which a supplier has to deliver products to a number of geographically dispersed customers, subject to side constraints. It provides integrated logistics solutions by simultaneously optimizing inventory management, vehicle routing, and delivery scheduling. Some exact algorithms and several powerful metaheuristic and matheuristic approaches have been developed for this class of problems, especially in recent years. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of this literature, based on a new classification of the problem. We categorize IRPs with respect to their structural variants and the availability of information on customer demand.	algorithm;branch and cut;categorization;emergence;heuristic (computer science);i/o request packet;inventory;logistics;metaheuristic;scheduling (computing);vehicle routing problem	Leandro C.

Our model considers a general fuel consumption function that depends on speed and load. To overcome intractability caused by nonlinear terms, we further separate fuel cost into two terms associated with ship speed and load to obtain a mixed integer linear programming formulation for approximation. Based on column generation techniques, we develop an iterative search algorithm that adaptively reorganizes the approximated formulation. We conduct extensive experiments using generated data sets from actual liner shipping services in different regions of the world to show the effectiveness of our approach as well as the significant impact of speed-load factors on fuel consumptions. Managerial insights are obtained by testing the model under different scenarios, which may greatly assist decision makers in the liner shipping industry.		Kevin X.

02d8819b358a0e03d7a36e5a411721317e23d0d2	solving a wind turbine maintenance scheduling problem	maintenance;scheduling;large neighborhood search;constraint programming	Driven by climate change mitigation efforts, the wind energy industry has significantly increased in recent years. In this context, it is essential to make its exploitation cost-effective. Maintenance of wind turbines therefore plays an essential role in reducing breakdowns and ensuring high productivity levels. In this paper, we discuss a challenging maintenance scheduling problem rising in the onshore wind power industry. While the research in the field primarily focuses on condition-based maintenance strategies, we aim to address the problem on a short-term horizon considering the wind speed forecast and a fine-grained resource management. The objective is to find a maintenance plan that maximizes the revenue from the electricity production of the turbines while taking into account multiple task execution modes and task-technician assignment constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a constraint programming-based large neighborhood search (CPLNS) approach. We also propose two integer linear programming formulations that we solve using a commercial solver. We report results on randomly generated instances built with input from wind forecasting and maintenance scheduling software companies. The CPLNS shows an average gap of 1.2% with respect to the optimal solutions if known, or to the best upper bounds otherwise. These computational results demonstrate the overall efficiency of the proposed metaheuristic.	exploit (computer security);integer programming;linear programming;procedural generation;scheduling (computing);software industry;solver	Aurélien Froger;Michel Gendreau;Jorge E.

e641ddcd02a5dd39f258ec9c298a8cefb215d8b6	towards a comprehensive model for track allocation and roll-time scheduling at marshalling yards		This paper considers multi-stage train formation with mixed usage tracks at a marshalling yard without departure yard. A novel integer programming model for scheduling shunting tasks as well as allocating arrival yard tracks and classification bowl tracks is presented. By taking a comprehensive view of the marshalling yard operations, more effective schedules can be found, and a variety of characteristics can be optimised, including shunting work effort, number or cost of tracks, and shunting task start times. Two different objective functions are evaluated: minimising work effort in terms of wagon pull-backs and minimising track costs. A procedure for finding a hot-start solution with few wagon pull-backs is also presented. The proposed model is tested on real data from Sävenäs marshalling yard in Sweden. The results show that the method is able to return an optimal schedule for a planning period of 4 days if the hot-start solution is optimal or the remaining problem is tractable for the heuristics in CPLEX.

f46cf27dcf1e84db0ba53e78d9279edbff78ae31	an adaptive large neighborhood search for the location-routing problem with intra-route facilities		Recent research on location-routing problems has been focusing on locating facilities as the starting and end point of routes. In this paper, we investigate a new type of location-routing problem. In the location-routing problem with intra-route facilities, the location of depots is known, whereas the location of facilities for intermediate stops has to be determined to keep vehicles operational. We present an adaptive large neighborhood search which is enhanced by local search and dynamic programming components, and derive new penalty functions for time-efficient neighborhood evaluation. We show that this algorithm is suitable for solving various problems with intra-route facilities by deriving new best known solutions for the recently published electric location-routing problem with time windows and partial recharging, as well as for the battery swap station electric vehicle location-routing problem.

This is an important problem in forest management and dicult to solve well in satisfying demand, while maximizing net pro®ts. Traditionally, foresters have used manual approaches to ®nd adequate solutions, which has shortcomings both in time spent by analysts and the quality of solutions. Since demand for timber products is de®ned by length, diameter and quality of each piece, this leads to a complex combinatorial problem in matching supply (standing trees) and demand. We developed one of the few reported approaches for solving the short term harvesting problem based on a computerized system, using a linear programming approach. Determining adequate bucking patterns is not trivial. We develop a column generation approach to generate such patterns. The subproblem is a specially designed branch and bound scheme. The generation of bucking patterns implemented within the LP formulation led to a signi®cant improvement of solutions. We believe this is the ®rst system implemented with this level of detail. This system has been advantageously implemented in several forest companies. The results obtained show improvements obtained by the ®rms of 5±8% in net revenues over traditional manual approaches.

To narrow the gap between the theory and the practice of the hybrid flowshop scheduling, we integrate two realistic and practical assumptions which are sequence-dependent setup and transportation times into our problem. We apply a metaheuristic based on simulated annealing (SA) which strikes a compromise between intensification and diversification mechanisms to augment the competitive performance of our proposed SA. A comprehensive calibration of different parameters and operators are done. We employ Taguchi method to select the optimum parameters with the least possible number of experiments. For the purpose of performance evaluation of our proposed algorithm, we generate a benchmark against which the adaptations of high performing algorithms in the literature are brought into comparison. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of increase of number of jobs on the performance of our algorithm.

A countermeasure from the demand-side has been the formation of procurement consortia by academic libraries which are intended to reduce costs and simultaneously optimizing the availability of academic journals in order to sufficiently serve their customers (i.e. faculty and students). The objective of this paper is to determine cost-minimal structures for library consortia. We develop a non-linear and binary optimization model which is solved by applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the GA by applying it to a real-world problem in the German academic e-journals market. The results show that the found solution results in costs that are approximately 30 % lower than the current regional-based solution.	centralized computing;consortium;cost efficiency;genetic algorithm;library (computing);mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;procurement;software release life cycle	Daniel Beimborn;Rainer B.

Smith School of Business The increasing material costs and the rapid advances in computing technology have both motivated and promoted the study of network problems that arise in several different application domains. This dissertation consists of four chapters on network applications in transportation, telecommunications, and supply chain management. The core of our research is to apply heuristic search procedures and combinatorial optimization techniques to various practical problems. In the second chapter we investigate the split delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP), where a customer’s demand can be split among several vehicles. The third chapter deals with the regenerator location problem (RLP) that arises in optical networks. The fourth chapter solves the parametric uncapacitated network design problems on series-parallel graphs, which have potential application in supply chain management. In the fifth chapter we study the arc routing problem that arises in the small package delivery industry. The last chapter summarizes the dissertation. The results in this dissertation indicate that the methodologies developed to solve the network problems in the four different applications are quite efficient. Consequently, when applied in practice, they have the potential to significantly improve the operational efficiency of organizations in the relevant application domains.	application domain;arc routing;combinatorial optimization;entity–relationship model;heuristic;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;rl (complexity);series-parallel graph;vehicle routing problem	Si Chen	2007			engineering management;engineering;operations management;operations research	ECom	17.242264103571266	3.8209205540438727	159906

Majority of the solution methods for the general redundancy allocation problems assume that the redundancy strategy for each subsystem is predetermined and fixed. In general, active redundancy has received more attention in the past. However, in practice both active and cold-standby redundancies may be used within a particular system design and the choice of the redundancy strategy becomes an additional decision variable. Thus, the problem is to select the best redundancy strategy, component, and redundancy level for each subsystem in order to maximize the system reliability under system-level constraints. This belongs to the NP-hard class of problems. Due to its complexity, it is so difficult to optimally solve such a problem by using traditional optimization tools. It is demonstrated in this paper that GA is an efficient method for solving this type of problems. Finally, computational results for a typical scenario are presented and the robustness of the proposed algorithm is discussed. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In essence, it entails positioning a set of ships into as few lock chambers as possible while satisfying a number of general and specific placement constraints. These constraints make the ship placement problem different from traditional 2D bin packing. A mathematical formulation for the problem is presented. In addition, a decomposition model is developed which allows for computing optimal solutions in a reasonable time. A multi-order best fit heuristic for the ship placement problem is introduced, and its performance is compared with that of the left-right-left-back heuristic. Experiments on simulated and real-life instances show that the multi-order best fit heuristic beats the other heuristics by a landslide, while maintaining comparable calculation times. Finally, the new heuristic’s optimality gap is small, while it clearly outperforms the exact approach with respect to calculation time. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The model is developed around airline-influenced factors that have an impact on engine Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO): Operations, maintenance philosophy, contract type, and fleet age. Within the model a decision support tool is developed to analyze the impact of possible changes made to variables that influence engine MRO (engine thrust setting, shop visit schedule, and workscopes) on maintenance cost. The objective of the model is to support Engineering and Maintenance in defining a maintenance philosophy, which includes engine time on-wing and Life Limited Parts management strategies. This maintenance philosophy will help with maintenance schedule optimization aiming at matching engine maintenance status to phase-out conditions at end of lease contracts, while at the same time reducing engine direct maintenance cost.

We extend a cost-based location-inventory model (Shen et al. 2003) to include a customer service element and develop practical methods for quick and meaningful evaluation of cost/service trade-offs. Service is measured by the fraction of all demands that are located within an exogenously specified distance of the assigned distribution center. The nonlinear model simultaneously determines distribution center locations and the assignment of demand nodes to distribution centers to optimize the cost and service objectives. We use a weighting method to find all supported points on the trade-off curve. We also propose a heuristic solution approach based on genetic algorithms that can generate optimal or close-to-optimal solutions in a much shorter time compared to the weighting method. Our results suggest that significant service improvements can be achieved relative to the minimum cost solution at a relatively small incremental cost.	genetic algorithm;heuristic;inventory theory;nonlinear system;reduced cost	Zuo-Jun Max Shen;Mark S.

This stage is significant to airline companies as it directly assigns operational routes and maintenance breaks for each aircraft in service. Most approaches related to the problem adopt set partitioning formulations that include exponentially many variables, which requires the design of specialized column generation or branch-and-price algorithms and codes. In this paper, we present a compact polynomial-sized representation for the ARP, which is then linearized and lifted using the reformulation-linearization technique. In addition, we propose two root-node strategies for further augmenting the model formulation. The resulting formulations remain polynomial in size, and we show that they can be solved very efficiently by commercial software without complicated algorithmic implementations. The numerical experiments demonstrate high-quality solutions and significant savings in computational time.	routing	Mohamed Haouari;Shengzhi Shao;Hanif D.

Since AVs are typically electric vehicles (EVs), they can contribute to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. While it is generally not feasible to dictate EV routes, we can design AV travel plans to fulfill certain system-wide objectives. In this paper, we focus on the AVs looking for parking and study how they can be led to appropriate parking facilities to support V2G services. We formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). It can be solved by a standard ILP solver but the required long computational time may not be acceptable in practical scenarios. To overcome this, we also develop a more efficient heuristic. We perform extensive simulations to study different perspectives on solving the problem. Simulation results reveal that the heuristic can significantly reduce the computational time with negligible degradation in objective function value. The quality of the optimal solution is insensitive to the number of available parking facilities. A coarser time scale can improve computational time but degrade the solution quality resulting in possible infeasible solution.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);centralized computing;computation;computer simulation;consistent pricing process;converge;distributed algorithm;elegant degradation;extended validation certificate;heuristic;linear programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;robust optimization;shadow price;simulation;solver;stochastic process;time complexity	Albert Y.

4339dafc2bea3529d18a207cea92622f79b53293	multi-objective tools for the vehicle routing problem with time windows	qa 75 electronic computers computer science	Most real-life problems involve the simultaneous optimisation of two or more, usually conflicting, objectives. Researchers have put a continuous effort into solving these problems in many different areas, such as engineering, finance and computer science. Over time, thanks to the increase in processing power, researchers have created methods which have become increasingly sophisticated. Most of these methods have been based on the notion of Pareto dominance, which assumes, sometimes erroneously, that the objectives have no known ranking of importance. The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a logistics problem which in real-life applications appears to be multi-objective. This problem consists of designing the optimal set of routes to serve a number of customers within certain time slots. Despite this problem’s high applicability to real-life domains (e.g. waste collection, fast-food delivery), most research in this area has been conducted with hand-made datasets. These datasets sometimes have a number of unrealistic features (e.g. the assumption that one unit of travel time corresponds to one unit of travel distance) and are therefore not adequate for the assessment of optimisers. Furthermore, very few studies have focused on the multi-objective nature of the VRPTW. That is, very few have studied how the optimisation of one objective affects the others. This thesis proposes a number of novel tools (methods + dataset) to address the abovementioned challenges: 1) an agent-based framework for cooperative search, 2) a novel multi-objective ranking approach, 3) a new dataset for the VRPTW, 4) a study of the pair-wise relationships between five common objectives in VRPTW, and 5) a simplified Multi-objective Discrete Particle Swarm Optimisation for the VRPTW.	agent-based model;computer science;logistics;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;pareto efficiency;particle swarm optimization;real life;vehicle routing problem	Juan Pedro Castro Gutiérrez	2012			simulation;engineering;operations management;operations research	AI	16.745843336588827	0.7616669798265762	161740
e181777909d35b5b4065fbf797c3bb5c37798b67	cityresolver: a decision support system for conflict resolution in smart cities		Resolution of conflicts across services in smart cities is an important yet challenging problem. We present CityResolver – a decision support system for conflict resolution in smart cities. CityResolver uses an Integer Linear Programming based method to generate a small set of resolution options, and a Signal Temporal Logic based verification approach to compute these resolution options' impact on city performance. The trade-offs between resolution options are shown in a dashboard to support decision makers in selecting the best resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CityResolver by comparing the performance with two baselines: a smart city without conflict resolution, and CityGuard which uses a priority rule-based conflict resolution. Experimental results show that CityResolver can reduce the number of requirement violations and improve the city performance significantly.	decision support system;integer programming;linear programming;logic programming;smart city;temporal logic	Meiyi Ma;John A.

The stochastic events from the model consist of random passenger arrivals, random boarding/alighting as well as random bus travel time. The expected value model employs two objective functions to maximize the bus company profit and to minimize the passengers waiting time cost respectively. The model is solved by a hybrid intelligent algorithm in which stochastic simulation and genetic algorithm are used to treat with the uncertain function. The algorithm efficiency is tested by a numerical experiment and concerned conclusions are drawn. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Instead of deciding the type of service beforehand, we propose to take into account the zigzagging option when designing a tour. We present MIP models for the extension of Undirected Chinese and Rural Postman Problem (UCPP, URPP). We show that these models can be solved reasonable well using a cutting-plane or branch-and-cut algorithm. Second, capacitated postman problems occur as subproblems in columngeneration and Lagrangian-relaxation approaches of the capacitated arcrouting problem. In order to model these and similar subproblems or submodels, we present the Profitable Capacitated Rural Postman Problem (PCRPP): In the PCRPP, edges that are serviced give a profit, but deadheading through edges generates costs. Both service and deadheading consume time. The task is to find a tour that maximizes the difference of profits and costs, while the overall duration of the tour must not exceed a given bound. The solution approach for this problem is again based on branch-and-cut.	algorithm;arc routing;branch and cut;cutting-plane method;graph (discrete mathematics);lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;route inspection problem;type of service	Stefan Irnich	2009			arc (geometry);cutting-plane method;lagrangian relaxation;column generation;profitability index;zigzag;arc routing;mathematical optimization;branch and cut;mathematics	Theory	16.056536443415617	3.097665842696612	161971

The MIP structure of this problem makes it fairly intractable for practical applications, which involve multiple products, factories, warehouses and distribution centres (DCs). The same problem formulated and studied under uncertainty makes it even more intractable. In this paper we consider two related modelling approaches and solution techniques addressing this issue. The first involves scenario analysis of solutions to “wait and see” models and the second involves a two-stage integer stochastic programming (ISP) representation and solution of the same problem. We show how the results from the former can be used in the solution of the latter model. We also give some computational results based on serial and parallel implementations of the algorithms.	computation	S. A. MirHassani;Cormac Lucas;Gautam Mitra;Enza Messina;Chandra A.

86c5fcde922bea2fa08004866a9be2613bf7a9b6	cold chain configuration design: location-allocation decision-making using coordination, value deterioration, and big data approximation		The study proposes a cold chain location-allocation configuration decision model for shippers and customers by considering value deterioration and coordination by using big data approximation. Value deterioration is assessed in terms of limited shelf life, opportunity cost, and units of product transportation. In this study, a customer can be defined as a member of any cold chain, such as cold warehouse stores, retailers, and last mile service providers. Each customer only manages products that are in a certain stage of the product life cycle, which is referred to as the expected shelf life. Because of the geographical dispersion of customers and their unpredictable demands as well as the varying shelf life of products, complexity is another challenge in a cold chain. Improved coordination between shippers and customers is expected to reduce this complexity, and this is introduced in the model as a longitudinal factor for service distance requirement. We use big data information that reflects geospatial attributes of location to derive the real feasible distance between shippers and customers. We formulate the cold chain location-allocation decision problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem, which is solved using the CPLEX solver. The proposed decision model increases efficiency, adequately equates supply and demand, and reduces wastage. Our study encourages managers to ship full truck load consignments, to be aware of uneven allocation based on proximity, and to supervise heterogeneous product allocation according to storage requirements.	approximation;big data;location-allocation	Adarsh Kumar Singh;Nachiappan Subramanian;Kulwant Singh Pawar;Ruibin Bai	2018	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-016-2332-z	simulation;marketing;operations management	Robotics	10.597339244617137	-1.5274190449541691	163026

In real-world cases, demand, traveling time or any parameters in classical models may change over the period of time. So, considering uncertainty yields more flexibility for the results and the proposed model. In our study, environmental uncertainty is described by discrete scenarios. In this model, we have service level constraint in order to prevent inventory lost in distribution centers (DCs). Also, we assume that customer's demand is stochastic with Poisson distribution function and DCs have coverage radius constraints thus any DC cannot service all the customers. In this model, location of DCs is selected and optimized and the best flow of products from supplier to DCs also from DCs to customers is determined. In this way, the customers' demand should be satisfied at least service level. To solve this nonlinear integer programming model we first present a new and robust solution based on a genetic search framework and then based on genetic algorithm results and some optimizer rules we propose a new heuristic method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	heuristic	Vahidreza Ghezavati;M. S. Jabal-Ameli;Ahmad Makui	2009	Expert Syst.

In this paper, we study the reliability of a one-shot system containing multifunctional components. Such systems have attracted increasing attention in many areas, such as ad hoc sensor networks. We derive the expressions for system reliability and reliability of each function, and formulate a redundancy allocation problem (RAP) with the objective of maximizing system reliability. Unlike constructing a system with single-functional components, the number of copies of a specific function to be included in each multifunctional component (i.e., functional redundancy) needs to be determined as part of the design. Moreover, a start-up strategy for turning on specific functions in these components must be decided prior to system operation. We develop a heuristic algorithm and include it in a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the new RAP. We also apply a Tabu search (TS) method for solving such NP-hard problems. Our numerical studies illustrate that the two-stage GA and the TS method are quite effective in searching for high-quality solutions.	ant colony optimization algorithms;computation;functional derivative;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;multi-function printer;np-hardness;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;rapid refresh;reliability engineering;software release life cycle;tabu search;time complexity	Yiwen Xu;Haitao Liao	2016	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2015.2484064	reliability engineering;database index;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;engineering;sensor;artificial intelligence;resource management;machine learning;redundancy	Embedded	16.277094773028132	-2.448700059212843	164207
4b1501566283a1913bdca53abd88f61c1abbdd40	handling of synergy into an algorithm for project portfolio selection		Public and private organizations continuously invest on projects. With a number of candidate projects bigger than those ones that can be funded, the organization faces the problem of selecting a portfolio of projects that maximizes the expected benefits. The selection is made on the evaluation of project groups and not on the evaluation of single projects. However, there is a factor that must be taken account, since it can significantly change the evaluation of groups: synergy. This is that two or more projects are complemented in a way that generates an additional benefit to they already own individually. Redundancy, a special case of synergy, occurs when two or more projects cannot be financed simultaneously. Both features add complexity to the evaluation of project groups. This article presents an evaluation of the two most used alternatives for handling synergy, in order to incorporate it into an ant-colony metaheuristic for solving project portfolio selection.	algorithm;metaheuristic;synergy	Gilberto Rivera Zarate;Claudia Gómez Santillán;Eduardo R.

2a9bec68dce30fb2c132f889c926ddc697c672cb	the effect of cooperation in pickup and multiple delivery problems		Small logistics companies operate in many towns and cities across the UK, and need to be able to compete with larger delivery companies who can leverage economies of scale to provide lower costs to customers. If small companies were willing to work together, all could benefit from reduced operating costs, enabling them to compete and survive against larger delivery companies. In cooperation with Transfaction Ltd., we investigate dynamic scheduling of shared loads for real-world, long distance truck haulage in the UK. We model the problem as a dynamic pickup and multiple delivery problem (PMDP). The PMDP is a one-many problem (one pickup, many drop-offs), unlike the more widely researched one-one (pickup and delivery problem, PDP) and one-many-one (vehicle routing problem, VRP) problems.	logistics;many-one reduction;scheduling (computing);towns;vehicle routing problem	Philip Mourdjis;Fiona A.

1616600ab159175316b9cb503581c3d0fea49a97	a new mathematical programming formulation for the single-picker routing problem	traveling salesman;picker routing;order picking	The Single-Picker Routing Problem deals with the determination of sequences according to which items have to be picked in a distribution warehouse and the identification of the corresponding paths which have to be travelled by human operators (order pickers). The Single-Picker Routing Problem represents a special case of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and, therefore, can also be modeled as a TSP. However, the picking area of a warehouse typically possesses a block layout, i.e. the items are located in parallel picking aisles, and the order pickers can only change over to another picking aisle at certain positions by means of so-called cross aisles. In this paper, for the first time a mathematical programming formulation is proposed which takes into account this specific property. Based on extensive numerical experiments, it is shown that the proposed formulation is superior to standard TSP formulations.	experiment;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;routing;travelling salesman problem	André Scholz;Sebastian Henn;Meike Stuhlmann;Gerhard Wäscher	2016	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2016.02.018	mathematical optimization;computer science;operations management;mathematics;travelling salesman problem;operations research	Robotics	16.765879293795166	2.0123209684192602	165211
3200d14441aabc94dff863403f26a386cc47cc52	reducing airport emissions with coordinated pushback processes: a case study		Empirical research has shown that airside ground operations imply a significant percentage of overall airport-related emissions. Among those operations, taxiing is one of the most emission-intensive processes, directly related to the initial pushback process that has a significant impact on the taxiing duration of departing flights. Possible approaches for an effective management of pushbacks at an airport are simulation and optimization models. Airside operations at major airports involve a complex interplay of many operations and parties and therefore need to be planned in a coordinated fashion. Yet, existing approaches have not been applied in a comprehensive planning environment for airside operations. In this work, we develop an algorithm-based relocation approach for pushback vehicles that enables an effective minimization of delays and emissions during the taxiing process. As a result alternative sequences of departing flights are evaluated against each other to find the ones with least total emissions and delay. These algorithms are applied in a simulation environment and evaluated against real-world cases. Preliminary results demonstrate that we are able to solve the underlying pushback routing problem in appropriate computational times for dynamic decision support needed at airports.

64537294619af69ab4e143e378eeb1e348a2c5b8	a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for personalized tours in street networks		The paper presents a novel optimizer to plan multiple–day walking itineraries, tailored to tourists’ personal interests, in a street network modeled as a graph. The tour is automatically designed by maximizing the number of the Points of Interest (POIs) to visit as a function of both tourists’ preferences and requirements, and constraints such as opening hours, visiting times and accessibility of the POIs, and weather forecasting. Since this itineray planning is classified as an NP–complete combinatorial optimization problem, a multiobjective evolutionary optimizer is here proposed. Such an optimizer is proven to be effective in designing personalized multiple–day tourist routes.	evolutionary algorithm	Ivanoe De Falco;Umberto Scafuri;Ernesto Tarantino	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_10	simulation;geography;artificial intelligence;transport engineering	ECom	16.305210645014554	0.06669777722844988	166170
813e9b7b8592bf79fae40e5ae71fc7e6e46b5d3f	a two-stage heuristic with ejection pools and generalized ejection chains for the vehicle routing problem with time windows	ejection chain;time window;vehicle routing;vehicle routing problem with time windows;scheduling;transportation;hill climbing;capacity constraint	The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is an important problem in logistics. The problem is to serve a number of customers at minimum cost without violating the customers' time-window constraints or the vehicle-capacity constraint. In this paper, we propose a two-stage algorithm for the VRPTW. The algorithm first minimizes the number of vehicles with an ejection pool to hold temporarily unserved customers, which enables the algorithm to go through the infeasible solution space. Then it minimizes the total travel distance using a multi-start iterated hill-climbing algorithm with classical and new operators including generalized ejection chains, which enable the algorithm to search a larger neighborhood. We applied the algorithm to Solomon's 56 VRPTW instances and Gehring and Homberger's 300 extended instances. The experimental results showed that the algorithm is effective and efficient in reducing the number of vehicles and is also very competitive in terms of distance minimization. The m-VRPTW is a variant of the VRPTW in which a limited number of vehicles is available. A feasible solution to m-VRPTW may contain some unserved customers due to the insufficiency of vehicles. The primary objective of m-VRPTW is to maximize the number of customers served. We extended our VRPTW algorithm to solve m-VRPTW and the experimental results showed consistently good performance of the algorithm when compared with other methods.	heuristic;microsoft windows;vehicle routing problem	Andrew Lim;Xingwen Zhang	2007	INFORMS Journal on Computing	10.1287/ijoc.1060.0186	transport;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;hill climbing;vehicle routing problem;mathematics;scheduling	Theory	16.39512695770115	1.9471793172940253	166243

0eb67e6ba8f48a0f6810718bd3c83ed334c5d55d	multiobjective transshipment point assignment in china express delivery network		The rapid development in logistics industry urges for an effective express delivery network, to deliver goods to customers in a prompt and cost effective way. Such a network is usually operated in a typical hub-and-spoke manner. Therefore, it is important to assign the hubs (known as transshipment points (TP)) in the network so as to maximize its performance. In this paper, the TP assignment problem is formulated as a multiobjective problem and solved by a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The practical usage of the design is demonstrated with a China express delivery network and its effectiveness is confirmed by comparing with a weighted exhaustive heuristic algorithm. As shown by the simulation results, our approach is very effective and a widely spread non-dominated solution set can be obtained.	assignment problem;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;heuristic (computer science);logistics;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;powera;simulation;systems design;usb hub	Zhongyan Fan;Xiaowen Bi;Doujie Li;Wallace K.

There is a common assumption that the receiving (shipping) dock has only one single door, but companies usually duplicate doors in parallel to expedite operations. This paper studies the problem of scheduling trucks in the cross-dock with multiple inbound and outbound doors with makespan minimization. The problem is first formulated by a new mixed integer programming model. Using the model, small instances are solved to optimality. The paper then proposes a hunting search metaheuristic inspired from group behavior of animals when searching and hunting for food. A set of experimental instances are carried out to evaluate the algorithm. The algorithm is carefully evaluated against the adaptation of two existing algorithms. The results show that the algorithm provides sound performance comparing with other algorithms.		Mehdi Yazdani;B. Naderi;M.

This solution state is, by definition, efficient to all entities with respect to their own individual goals and to the system as a whole. In these dynamic environments, this solution state can be achieved by utilizing software techniques from the field of game theory in order to make optimal decisions. We present an application built upon a generalized optimization framework that can be applied to a number of domains, such as cargo or network traffic algorithms. In this research, we used a market-based approach to air traffic flow management through a modeling and simulation environment. The aim is to allow individual aircraft a certain degree of local autonomy, much like cars on a highway. Our system is able to cope in real time with failures such as node loss and adjust system parameters accordingly to optimize results based on the goals of the involved agents. We describe tradeoffs between different agent interaction frameworks with respect to their performance in market mechanism auctions. We also discuss lessons learned while implementing this application. This research has built upon our previously reported work [20, 21] on route optimizations and airspace sector design in an air traffic control network, by adding in the goals of interested entities, e.g. airlines, aircraft, and airports, maximizing the “payoff” to each player (agent). It is intended that the results of our work will be directly used in this domain. In addition, we envision our work being leveraged for other optimization tasks such as data traffic on a network, first responder / disaster relief efforts, and other tasks where rapid solving of large-scale optimization problems is essential.	program optimization	Thomas Castelli;Joshua Lee;Waseem Naqvi	2006		10.1007/11827405_56	game theory;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;modeling and simulation;operations research;expert system;aviation	ML	13.994455254659044	-0.7310828202722114	168498

A contribution is made in the area of proactive scheduling with the development of a stochastic odeling framework to support the short-term scheduling problem with uncertain operation times and equipment breakdowns. A set of scenarios or the uncertain parameters is anticipated in the decision stage, along with information concerning the reactive scheduling approach to be taken uring schedule execution. A robust predictive schedule is pursued, with the flexibility to absorb disruptive events without major changes when escheduling is required. Either rigorous or heuristic techniques can be used to optimize a robustness measure that explicitly accounts for the ventual wait times and idle times that may arise during execution. The application of the framework to different case studies shows the flexibility f the predictive schedule, the different decisions that can be drawn based on the rescheduling strategy considered, and the importance of exploiting he information of the uncertainty as well as the incorporation of the rescheduling policy proactively. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

37f03d743f34bf25b7ea017efe66a31b876e2243	multi-objective evolutionary optimization for autonomous intersection management		This paper investigates the real-time application of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for managing traffic at an intersection with its focus on autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing works on intersection management emphasize using MOEAs to optimize parameters for traffic-light based intersections, or they target human drivers. However, the advent of autonomous vehicles has changed the field of intersection management. To maximize the use of autonomous vehicles, the intersections should be autonomous also. This paper proposes an autonomous intersection management (AIM) system that controls the speed for each vehicle approaching at an intersection by using MOEA. The proposed system first looks at splitting the continuous problem of intersection management into smaller independent scenarios. Then it utilizes the MOEA to find solutions for each scenario by optimizing multiple objectives with different goals in terms of overall performance. In order to give the MOEA low level control of traffic at intersections, the autonomous vehicles are modelled as travelling along a predefined path, with a speed determined by the MOEA.

2b46a5c5b0afe6c64f23726ca789496feb9068da	selective vehicle routing for a mobile blood donation system	routing;mobile blood collection;healthcare logistics;selective vehicle routing problem	In this study, a mobile blood collection system is designed with the primary objective of increasing blood collection levels. This design also takes into account operational costs to aim for collection of large amounts of blood at reasonable cost. Bloodmobiles perform direct tours to certain activities to collect blood, but at the end of each day, they bring the collected blood to a designated depot to prevent its spoilage. The proposed system consists of the bloodmobiles and a new vehicle called the shuttle that visits the bloodmobiles in the field on each day and transfers the collected blood to the depot. Consequently, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to make daily returns to the depot. We propose a mathematical model and a 2-stage IP based heuristic algorithm to determine the tours of the bloodmobiles and the shuttle, and their lengths of stay at each stop. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and is referred to as the SVRP with Integrated Tours. The performances of the solution methodologies are tested first on a real data set obtained from past blood donation activities of Turkish Red Crescent in Ankara, and then on a constructed data set based on GIS data of the European part of Istanbul. The Pareto set of optimum solutions is generated based on blood amounts and logistics costs, and finally a sensitivity analysis on some important design parameters is conducted. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The portion of a signal cycle for which this is possible is called the bandwidth for that direction. A mixed-integer linear program is formulated for the following arterial problem: Given 1 an arbitrary number of signals, 2 the red-green split at each signal, 3 upper and lower limits on signal period, 4 upper and lower limits on speed between adjacent signals, and 5 limits on change in speed, find 1 common signal period, 2 speeds between signals, and 3 the relative phasing of the signals, in order to maximize the sum of the bandwidths for the two directions. Several variants of the problem are formulated, including the problem of synchronizing a network of signals. Branch-and-bound algorithms are developed for solving the mixed-integer linear programs by solving sequences of ordinary linear programs. A 10-signal arterial example and a 7-signal network example are worked out.	integer programming;linear programming	John D. C.

A crew pairing is a sequence of flight legs beginning and ending at the same crew domicile. Crew pairing planning is the primary cost-determining phase in airline crew scheduling. Optimizing crew pairings of an airline timetable is an extremely important process which helps to minimize operational crew costs and to maximize crew utilization.There are various restrictions imposed by regulations or company policies that must be considered and satisfied in crew pairing generation process. Keeping these restrictions and regulations in mind, the main goal of the optimization is the generation of low cost sets of valid crew pairings which cover all flights in airline's timetable.For this research study, already existing works related to crew pairing optimization are examined and a new column generation strategy, a pricing network design and a pairing elimination heuristic are developed as a contribution to the previous studies. In the proposed strategy, the main problem is modeled and solved as a set-covering problem and the pricing sub problem is modeled as a shortest-path problem which is efficiently solved over a duty-flight overnight connection graph by the combined usage of heuristic and exact algorithms. The proposed strategy has been tested with real world data obtained from Turkish Airlines and it is seen that it is capable of generating very competitive solutions compared to current practices in Turkish Airlines. It is also observed that there are various advantages of proposed solution approach such as sensitivity to penalty coefficients, generating less deadheads, very close solution times with a single threaded software and light weight hardware.	column generation	Bahadir Zeren;Ibrahim Özkol	2016	Expert Syst.

A supply system with intermediate warehouses has to be established to provide affected people with relief goods. A three-objective optimization model with a medium-term economic, a short-term economic, and a humanitarian objective function is used. We apply the epsilon constraint method to determine the Pareto frontier. To solve the single-objective constrained optimization problem, we propose an exact solution method as well as a ''math-heuristic'' technique building on a MILP formulation with a heuristically generated constraint pool. As a subproblem, the multiple-depot, multiple-trip capacitated team orienteering problem is solved. We present a MIP formulation and a VNS procedure for this problem. Synthetically generated instances and a real-world illustration case are used for our computational studies. The results of the math-heuristic technique are compared to those obtained from an application of the NSGA-II metaheuristic and, where possible, to those of the exact solution approach.	heuristic;routing	Stefan Rath;Walter J.

The allocation is constrained by facility capacities – different facilities may have different capacities and the overall capacity may be inadequate to satisfy the total demands. This research transforms this special location-allocation problem into a clustering model. The proposed approach has two parts: (1) the allocation of demands to facilities considering capacity constraints while minimizing the cost; and (2) the iterative optimization of facility locations using an adapted K-means clustering method. The quality of a location-allocation solution is measured using an objective function, which is the demand-weighted distance from demand locations to their assigned facilities. The clustering-based method is evaluated against an adapted Genetic Algorithm (GA) alternative, which integrates the allocation component as described above but uses GA operations to search for ‘optimal’ facility locations. Experiments and evaluations are carried out with various data sets (including both synthetic and real data).	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;facility location problem;genetic algorithm;iterative method;k-means clustering;location-allocation;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;synthetic data	Ke Liao;Diansheng Guo	2008	Trans.

8f6f4b8e4509c1b1e0951ab24ae6407a24a2180c	design of a fuzzy bi-objective reliable p-hub center problem		Nowadays in all shipment delivery systems, most of customers are looking for companies that offer fast and reliable delivery service as well as guarantee when deliveries will be made. With variability in travel time, the configuration of the hub-and-spoke network is vital to meet the delivery service requirement. For this purpose, a bi-objective stochastic p-hub center problem is considered to investigate the effect of delivery service requirement on the configuration of the hub- and-spoke network with fuzzy parameters, in which hub operational nodes may disrupt and fail to operate shipments. Since delivery time of the shipments is the sum of transit time over the links and spent time at the hubs, spent times with fuzzy arrival of shipments are calculated by utilizing a fuzzy M/M/1 queuing system. In order to solve large-sized instances of the presented mathematical model, two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely SA and self-adaptive DE (SADE) are developed and their performances are evaluated using a proposed lower bound approach. Computational experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution approaches.

While ships are the main mode for intercontinental transport, pipelines are the chief form of transcontinental transport, while regional and local transports is performed by trains and trucks. Despite high installation costs, pipelines are considered highly efficient as a mode for transporting large amounts of oil and oil products over long distances, because they offer lower operation costs, higher reliability rates, lower product loss rates, less environmental impact, and less susceptibility to adverse weather conditions than other modes. This study deals with a multi-product pipeline system that trans- ports a set of oil products (diesel, gasoline and kerosene, for example), which have to be moved from points (operating areas) where they are produced or stored (refineries, terminals) to points where they are needed (other refineries, distribution centers, terminals, ports, customers) through a pipeline or set of pipelines. The present study contributes primarily by offering an efficient tool for the problem of scheduling multi-product pipeline networks. The methodology proposed takes the approach of discretizing both pipelines and planning horizon and combines an efficient MILP model with a post-processing heuristic. When compared with previous models, we propose a more efficient one in which the set of volumetric constraints is modeled in the form of knapsack cascading constraints and constraints on products in pipeline sections, which made for significantly improved performance in the experiments that were conducted. The proposed methodology thus constitutes an advance in terms of modeling the problem, making it feasible to solve problems increasingly close to the realities confronting oil industry operators.	scheduling (computing)	Erito Marques de Souza Filho;Laura Bahiense;Virgílio José Martins Ferreira Filho	2013	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2013.01.019	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;forensic engineering;scheduling	DB	12.019582091267825	1.5040846482259003	174145

In the VMC scheduling problem, each job undergoes different processing routes and there is a set of machines to process any operation. Jobs are produced in lot and lot-streaming is permitted. In addition, machines are distributed through the facility, which raises the travelling time issue. For this reason, the decisions are machine assignments, starting times and sub-lot sizes of the operations. We develop a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that considers all aspects of the problem. Owing to the intractability matter, it is unlikely that the MILP could provide solutions for big-sized instances within a reasonable amount of time. We therefore present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a new chromosome structure for the VMC environment. Based on a wide range of examinations, comparative results show that GA is quite favourable and that it obtains the optimum solution for any of the instances in the case where sub-lot number equals 1.	genetic algorithm;job scheduler;job shop scheduling;mathematical model;scheduling (computing)	Saadettin Erhan Kesen;Zülal Güngör	2012	JORS	10.1057/jors.2011.86	project management;logistics;simulation;genetic algorithm;inventory;economics;forecasting;investment;computer science;marketing;operations management;mathematical model;reliability;mathematics;location;management;operations research;information technology;scheduling;statistics	Robotics	14.575951348696416	2.6242108044178747	174178
4ef0e0497e533b462a7938cfbb92de30aa782eca	lot sizing with storage losses under demand uncertainty		We address a variant of the single item lot sizing problem affected by proportional storage (or inventory) losses and uncertainty in the product demand. The problem has applications in, among others, the energy sector, where storage losses (or storage deteriorations) are often unavoidable and, due to the need for planning ahead, the demands can be largely uncertain.We first propose a two-stage robust optimization approachwith second-stage storage variables, showing how the arising robust problem can be solved as an instance of the deterministic one. We then consider a two-stage approachwhere not only the storage but also the production variables are determined in the second stage. After showing that, in the general case, solutions to this problem can suffer from acausality (or anticipativity), we introduce a flexible affine rule approach which, albeit restricting the solution set, allows for causal production plans. A hybrid robust-stochastic approach where the objective function is optimized in expectation, as opposed to in the worst-case, while retaining robust optimization guarantees of feasibility in the worst-case, is also discussed.

In the past, the inventory policy, vehicle routing and vehicle scheduling are determined sequentially and separately. Hence, the total cost (inventory, routing and vehicle costs) would increase. In this paper, an integrated model for the inventory routing and scheduling problem (IRSP) is proposed. Since searching for the optimal solution for this model is a non-polynomial (NP) problem, a metaheuristic, variable neighborhood search (VNS), is proposed. The proposed method was compared with other existing methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is better than other methods in terms of average cost per day. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

0b1375495a90a8ce1edb1e0f92ee4a42b696ab7c	a first look at bridging discrete choice modeling and agent-based microsimulation in matsim		The agent-based transport simulation framework MATSim allows for the simulation of dynamic transport scenarios with agents, that adaptively make travel choices. Regarding mode choice, a heavily randomized process is used to date, which allows for very unrealistic mode decisions in the short run to arrive at consistent mode shares after a large number of iterations. The authors show that implementing a discrete mode choice model may drastically increase the convergence speed of the simulation, but point out that considerable future research is necessary to make travel decisions consistent and to back the process with a strong theoretical foundation. c © 2018 The Authors.

The solution to the PSRP is described by a series of operations or a plan to be used by the Power System operator immediately on the occurrence of a blackout in the electrical power supply. Our GA uses new initialization and crossover operators based on the electrical power network, which are able to generate and maintain the plans feasible along GA runs. This releases the Power Flow program, which represents the most computer demanding component, from computing the fitness function of unfeasible individuals. Results for three different electrical power networks are shown: IEEE 14-Bus, IEEE 30-Bus and a large realistic system.	circuit restoration;fitness function;genetic algorithm;metaheuristic;power supply;sysop	Adelmo Luis Cechin;José Vicente Canto dos Santos;Arthur Tórgo Gómez;Carlos A.

Several web and mobile tourist city guides already support personalized tour recommendations. However, they exclusively consider walking tours; namely, they fail in motivating tourists to use public transportation for reaching far located important POIs, thereby compromising the perceived overall attractiveness of recommended tours. In this paper, we introduce eCOMPASS, a context-aware web/mobile application which derives personalized multimodal tours via selected urban attractions. eCOMPASS is the only available research or commercial tour planner that assists the way arounds of tourists through public transit. Far beyond than just providing navigational aid, eCOMPASS incorporates multimodality (i.e. time dependency) within its routing logic aiming at deriving near-optimal sequencing of POIs along recommended tours so as to best utilize the time available for sightseeing and minimize waiting time at transit stops. Further advancing the state of the art, eCOMPASS allows users to define arbitrary start/end locations (e.g. the current location of a mobile user) rather than choosing among a fixed set of locations. Last, eCOMPASS may assist in scheduling lunch breaks at affordable restaurants, conveniently located along the recommended tours. The provision of the above mentioned unique features of eCOMPASS is based on modeling and solving a complex optimization problem which takes into account a long list of problem variables and constraints. This paper describes the routing algorithm which comprises the core functionality of eCOMPASS. Further, it discusses the implementation details of the web and mobile eCOMPASS applications using the metropolitan areas of Athens (Greece) and Berlin (Germany) as case studies.

The focus is on the wholesale side of the supply network. Rigorous solution methods using both set partitioning and tabu search are developed for obtaining optimal and near-optimal solutions for the purchasing/routing problem. The proposed methods are applied to a real-world propane distribution problem. The results of the study indicate that the potential annual cost savings through the integration of purchasing and routing decisions can range up to millions of dollars for large distributors. The methods can also be used strategically as an aid in reconfiguring the supply network involving depot locations, tanker fleet sizing, and allocation of capacity at supply terminals. The methodology could also be used to provide decision support for distributing other energy products such as heating oil. 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.	backhaul (telecommunications);data pre-processing;decision support system;dynamic dispatch;heuristic;integer programming;logistics;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;operations research;preprocessor;purchasing;routing;tabu search;timothy j. hickey	Wen-Chyuan Chiang;Robert A.

f0071820ad51ab3a6975ae82d2ead08ed6d40c38	using gis for optimisation in transportation planning	transportation planning	39 Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are a widely investigated class of problems in combinatorial optimisation, and include many transportation tasks (eg parcel services). In general, a VRP consists of a set of customers that must be served via a fleet of vehicles, each of which leaves from and returns to a central depot. The type of VRP determines whether customers have goods delivered to them, are transported from one location to another, or are served in some other way. U Us si in ng g G GI IS S f fo or r R Re ea al l-W Wo or rl ld d I In np pu ut t D Da at ta a In research, most solution techniques for this class of problem are designed and tested by means of synthetic problem structures. However, the tackling of real-world VRPs requires a thoroughly elaborated data basis in order to provide reasonable outcomes. If this is not the case, even the best solution techniques are of no use for practical applications. Essential input data for real-world VRPs is gathered by using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Whereas most researchers use Euclidean distances between customers and depots for their optimisation algorithms, a GIS can provide real distance information derived from a digital road network. Experiences in former projects showed that using distance data of limited quality in optimisation algorithms leads to results of even more limited quality. In the worst case, a valid solution for a given input dataset might actually be unfeasible in reality. To get distance information of sufficient quality, the most detailed street network commercially available for the considered region should be used. Unfortunately static distance information from a digital road network does not correlate directly with real travel times because of dynamic influences like traffic jams, road works and weather conditions. Travel times also depend on parameters such as driving style and vehicle type, which are particularly hard to quantify. E Em mp pi ir ri ic ca al l E Ev va al lu ua at ti io on n o of f T Tr ra av ve el l T Ti im me es s In a former project, the quality of calculated driving times was evaluated by comparing them with actual driving times for 91 trips within a range of 20 to 250 kilometres in eastern Austria.

ea4b932f423c81f6cca864184fb6fabf139476c9	stochastic on-time arrival problem in transit networks		This article considers the stochastic on-time arrival problem in transit networks where both the travel time and the waiting time for transit services are stochastic. A specific challenge of this problem is the combinatorial solution space due to the unknown ordering of transit line arrivals. We propose a network structure appropriate to the online decision-making of a passenger, including boarding, waiting and transferring. In this framework, we design a dynamic programming algorithm that is pseudo-polynomial in the number of transit stations and travel time budget, and exponential in the number of transit lines at a station, which is a small number in practice. To reduce the search space, we propose a definition of transit line dominance, and techniques to identify dominance, which decrease the computation time by up to 90% in numerical experiments. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on both a synthetic network and the Chicago transit network.	algorithm;computation;dynamic programming;experiment;feasible region;numerical analysis;polynomial;synthetic intelligence;time complexity	Yang Liu;Sebastien Blandin;Samitha Samaranayake	2018	CoRR	10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.013	mathematical optimization;dynamic programming;economics;computation;small number;exponential function	ML	16.04767133338768	2.6339902977972707	176883
0f6eb65fdf9025b770c078c6cf2acab70ce854b9	a study on real-time rescheduling with delayed departure control using linear programming		An operation technology for effectively using regenerative braking is delayed-departure control in which an operator delays the departure time of a train to match the predicted arrival time of another train. A method for real-time rescheduling with delayed-departure control is proposed that uses two metrics based on the overlap of train run-curves and that divides the timetable into shorter time periods. This division eliminates the effect of delay propagation so that train pairing can be optimized among n departing trains and m arriving trains by using linear programming. A train-pair candidate is searched for at nearby locations under time-dependent constraints. Testing using real data for a 5-min timetable demonstrated that a rescheduled timetable with delayed departures can be calculated within 2 s, which satisfies the requirement for real-time operation.	linear programming;real-time clock;real-time transcription;schedule;software propagation;time of arrival	Takaaki Yamada;Tatsuhiro Sato;Kenji Oguma;Tsutomu Miyauchi	2017	2017 IEEE 10th International Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IWCIA)	10.1109/IWCIA.2017.8203552	mathematical optimization;operator (computer programming);computer science;real-time computing;schedule;regenerative brake;train;linear programming;pairing	Embedded	13.729654190587922	1.6989094634671065	177183

For this goal a special two-phase approach is used. The first phase consists of applying a special adjusted DEA model—input oriented hybrid model with non-controllable and bounded inputs with categorical decision making units under constant returns to scale—for evaluating efficiency of UPT lines and for obtaining recommendations for improving their efficiency. Based on the recommendations from the first phase, in the second phase a possible assignment of dispatched vehicles of inefficient UPT lines is proposed. The results of the conducted analysis offer suggestions to improve efficiency of the UPT so that the balance between supply and demand for transport services is maintained. The proposed method is applied to the UPT system in a Slovak city, Banska Bystrica.

Many of these researchers have discovered that the potential savings are substantial when process planning and scheduling are integrated. It has been reported that typical scheduling objectives, such as minimizing makespan, maximizing equipment utilization, etc, can be significantly improved as the result of integration of these two important manufacturing system functions. In this paper, we present a review of the reported research in this area, discuss the extent of applicability of various approaches, and suggest directions for future research.	automated planning and scheduling;scheduling (computing)	Wei Tan;Behrokh Khoshnevis	2000	J.

Our approach is first to decompose the overall problem spatially into three domains: the crude-oil unloading and blending, the production-unit operations and the product blending and delivery. In particular, the first problem involves the crude-oil unloading from vessels, its transfer to storage tanks and the charging schedule for each crude oil mixture to the distillation units. The second problem consists of the production unit scheduling which includes both fractionation and reaction processes and the third problem describes the finished product blending and shipping end of the refinery. Each of those sub-problems is modeled and solved in a most efficient way using continuous time representation due to relatively small number of variables and constraints. Our last step is to address the integration of these sub-problems by applying heuristic based Lagrangian decomposition iterative methodology. The proposed methodology is applied to realistic case studies and significant computational savings can be achieved compared with existing discrete time models.	alpha compositing;computation;date and time representation by country;heuristic;iterative method;mathematical optimization;programming model;scheduling (computing)	Zhenya Jia;Marianthi G.

In this paper, a tabu search meta-heuristic is proposed to solve the truck scheduling problem for both the classical cross-dock and the PI-hub. The objective is to minimize the total tardiness of both inbound and outbound trucks. Since in real world supply chain resources failures are possible, a robustness testing mechanism is presented to evaluate the robustness of the tabu search solutions by generating internal transportation resources breakdowns with different probabilities for both the classical cross-dock and the PI-hub. The impact of the internal transportation resources failure on the performance of the cross-dock and the PI-hub is compared. The proposed solving methods are tested on a case study instance inspired from a cross-dock of an industrial partner.

350dc604f9188d562be8bc67f9481bdd4b948036	maintenance scheduling of a fleet of fighter aircraft through multi-objective simulation-optimization	aircraft maintenance scheduling;multi attribute value function;simulated annealing;multi objective simulation optimization	The maintenance scheduling problem of a fleet of fighter aircraft is considered through multi-objective simulationoptimization (MOSO). In the problem, a maintenance schedule consisting of target starting times of the maintenance activities of the aircraft is determined. The objectives are to minimize average deviation between the target and actual starting times of the activities and to maximize average aircraft availability. The objectives depend on the maintenance schedule through complex interactions due to a policy in which the need for maintenance is based on the flight hours of the aircraft cumulated during flight missions. In addition, the durations of the flight missions, maintenance activities, and failure repairs are uncertain. Therefore, an MOSO approach is applied to the problem. The approach includes a discrete-event simulation model and a state-of-the art multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm for determining non-dominated schedules. Moreover, a multi-attribute value (MAV) function is used for supporting a maintenance decision-maker (DM) in selecting the preferred non-dominated schedule for implementation. The MAV function captures incomplete information on the values of the objectives as well as on the DM’s preference statements regarding the weights of the objectives. The approach is implemented as an MOSO tool whereby the DM can consider the complex interactions and uncertainties of the problem which have not been addressed in the existing literature on maintenance scheduling. The approach and the tool are illustrated with a set of test problems as well as a real-life example problem.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;computation;decision theory;interaction;mathematical optimization;programming tool;real life;reason maintenance;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;simulation;turing test	Ville Mattila;Kai Virtanen	2014	Simulation	10.1177/0037549714540008	simulation;simulated annealing;computer science;engineering;operations research	AI	14.327898991212361	-0.6973905206672151	179633

The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we have developed a general Multiple Neighborhood Search hybridized with a Tabu Search (MNS-TS) strategy which is proved to be efficient and second, we have settled an unified view of ejection chains to be able to handle several neighborhoods in a simple manner. The neighborhoods in the proposed MNS-TS are generated from path moves and ejection chains. The numerical and statistical tests carried out over OVRP and MDOVRP problem instances from the literature show that MNS-TS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	tabu search;vehicle routing problem	María Soto;Marc Sevaux;André Rossi;Andreas Reinholz	2017	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2017.03.022	mathematical optimization;simulation;operations management;mathematics	Robotics	16.382817912691152	1.9051334739718666	179862

The problem consists in developing a distribution plan to replenish inventory at each of the involved sales-points, and then clustering them in groups willing to cooperate and share parts of their stocks. The distribution strategy and clustering should be achieved in a way that minimises total distribution and inventory costs of the system. Clearly, cooperation inside each cluster increases the extra potential inventory to which each member of the cluster has access, without having to support the related cost. As a result, the service level that each of these sales-point may achieve would increase. This approach is implemented for a real-life supply chain. A part of obtained results are reported and discussed in the paper.	game theory;real life;routing	Manuel Mateo;El Houssaine Aghezzaf;Pau Vinyes	2012	IJBPSCM	10.1504/IJBPSCM.2012.044975	inventory theory;simulation;economics;operations management;commerce	AI	12.700919052251102	0.3891528205414794	180280

We will analyze the maximum theoretical increase of the profit due to the incomplete service and to the split deliveries.

This housekeeping process aims at speeding-up discharge and loading operations and, thus, relieving congestion. This paper introduces a heuristic procedure to manage the routing of multi-trailer systems and straddle carriers in a maritime terminal. A simulation model embedded in a local search heuristic allows a proper evaluation of the impact of different vehicle schedules on congestion and throughput. Computational experiments performed on test instances derived from real-life data show that important improvements in routing distance and vehicle waiting time can be obtained compared to the use of standard scheduling policies.	mathematical optimization;simulation-based optimization	Jean-François Cordeau;Pasquale Legato;Rina Mary Mazza;Roberto Trunfio	2015	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2014.08.001	logistics;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;vehicle routing problem;mathematics	NLP	14.657258040899512	1.6851566753870402	181496
74179be43fa05dea8240c8b0558d7d982ce5130f	an efficient decision making process for vehicles operations in underground mining	operation underground mining;decision making process;mining vehicles management	Day by day, the LHD (load-haul-dump) vehicle operator addresses the routing problems at the production level of mine, whose solution impacts on the performance of all the production chain. Unfortunately, the operator’s goal of minimizing the makespan of his workload is not necessarily optimal as one needs to take into account the coordination with next operation levels. In this paper, we stated the problem to determine the working path of LHD vehicle for minimizing the makespan subject to the coordination between the production level and next the operation level, so called the reduction level. We prove that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, propose an exact formulation by a mixed integer linear programming (MIP) model and generate an approximation algorithm. From a real implementation point of view, we developed a simple-to-execute decision-making process (DMP) for the LHD vehicle operator based on the generated approximation algorithm. Finally, we study DMP performance by a numerical analysis based on data from the Chilean underground copper mine, called El Teniente . The results show that the approximation ratio in practice is only 1.08.		Óscar C. Vásquez;Ignacio J. Vargas;Juan M.

078cfa5161c6f7d4d9e880ea2e42618e100705e1	a new approach to solve operations planning problems of the outpatient chemotherapy process		Increasing number of cancer survivors besides efficient medications render demand for cancer service care dramatically increasing. Hence, stakeholders have to investigate new ways in order to enhance cancer treatment operational performance. Outpatient chemotherapy management is a complex problem due to large variability in treatment times as a result of the different cancer types and thus different chemotherapy protocols, and scarce resources. In this paper, we address the operations planning problem of the outpatient chemotherapy process, namely; the assignment of the optimum first day of treatment for a set of new patients in tandem with the presence of existing patients. We propose a mixed-integer programming model that assigns new patients to their starting days of treatment fulfilling two objectives; minimizing the treatment delay of the new patients and the total completion times under resources availability constraints. For the first time in outpatient chemotherapy planning problems, we consider the drug availability constraint and pharmacists working times constraint. We solve the model using CPLEX solver for parameters retrieved from a real case study from the literature, and the results give a global optimum solution. Furthermore, we modify the model to include solving the capacity planning problem, namely, setting the number of nurses and pharmacists as decision variables other than pre-specify them as an input. The results of the modified model provide the optimum number of nurses and pharmacists required each day in a certain planning horizon. Finally, we propose an empirical rule calculating the required nurse treatment time which is dedicated to each patient as a proportion of the infusion time. This rule anticipates the actual working times for nurses, which is useful in balancing the workload for nurses who are working in outpatient chemotherapy units.	automated planning and scheduling;cplex;decision theory;global optimization;heart rate variability;integer programming;linear programming;programming model;simulation;solver	M.

It involves collaboration in multiple dimensions viz. information sharing, capacity planning, and reliability among players. One of the most important dimensions of the supply chain network is to determine its optimal operating conditions incurring minimum total costs. However, this is even a tough job due to the complexities involved in the dynamic interaction among multiple facilities and locations. In order to resolve these complexities and to identify the optimal operating condition we have proposed a hybrid approach incorporating simulation, Taguchi method, robust multiple non-linear regression analysis and the Psychoclonal algorithm. The Psychoclonal algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that inherits its traits from Maslow need hierarchy theory and the Artificial Immune System (AIS). The results obtained using the proposed hybrid approach is compared with those found out by replacing Psychoclonal algorithm with the Artificial Immune System (AIS) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), respectively. This research makes it possible for the firms to understand the intricacies of the dynamics and interdependency among the various factors involved in the supply chain. It provides guidelines to the manufacturers for the selection of appropriate plant capacity and also proposes a justified strategy for delayed differentiation.	algorithm;embedded system;program optimization;simulation;supply chain network;taguchi methods	Sanjay Kumar Shukla;Manoj Kumar Tiwari;Hung-Da Wan;Ravi Shankar	2010	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2009.07.016	mathematical optimization;response surface methodology;simulation;taguchi methods;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;operant conditioning;supply chain;operations research;orthogonal array;artificial immune system;regression analysis;nonlinear regression;statistics	EDA	11.410554451641625	1.7330161115636238	182062

Moreover large amount of calculation should be processed which is very difficult when the number of the loading or unloading places is large by use of the traditional algorithm. Taking the uncertainty of car group collection and delivery operation times and freight operating times into account, a fuzzy linear regression prediction model and an uncertain mathematical model of car-group-collection-and- delivery schedule for through trains are formulated and a Partheno-genetic algorithm (PGA) is put forward to resolve the model, besides, analyzed by using an example.

Literature provides surveys based on summaries of previous studies, which are often based on theoretical descriptions of the methods. An engineer, however, requires some evidence from experimental evaluations in order to make the appropriate decision when selecting a technique for a problem. This is what we have done in this paper: experimentally analyzed a set of representative stateof-the-art techniques in the problem we are dealing with, namely, the road passenger transportation problem. This is an optimization problem in which drivers should be assigned to transport services, fulfilling some constraints and minimizing some function cost. The experimental results have provided us with good knowledge of the properties of several methods, such as modeling expressiveness, anytime behavior, computational time, memory requirements, parameters, and free downloadable tools. Based on our experience, we are able to choose a technique to solve our problem. We hope that this analysis is also helpful for other engineers facing a similar problem. & 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

An alternate solution has been optimizing traffic flow by fleeting traffic signals. A roadway is fleeted when its signal sequence allows a platoon of vehicles to travel its length without being stopped by a red light, which in turn reduces congestion. The advantages of fleeting could be increased by fleeting multiple intersecting roadways. Our research examines the conditions necessary to accomplish timing traffic signals in intersecting directions so that both directions can have platooned vehicles simultaneously. The traffic signals at the intersecting roadways must be synchronized to maintain the fleeting sequences for both roadways. Through our analysis, we conclude that the time to travel along the roadways between traffic signals that are timed for platooning in multiple directions must be equivalent. Since many roadway distances are already known (unless a new road is being constructed), the only variable affecting the time to travel along a roadway is the speed limit. If variable speed limits are used, traffic signals on intersecting roadways are able to be fleeted.	network congestion	Jeffrey Miller;Wolfram Donat;John Harris	2012	2012 15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338855	simulation;engineering;automotive engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	12.04683174133462	2.546911904529137	182207

The underlying decision problem is modeled using an integer programming formulation similar to vehicle routing with time windows (VRPTW). To take advantage of standard approaches for the VRPTW, we develop a transformation schema that allows a one-to-one mapping between the manufacturing problem and VRPTW. An efficient heuristic to solve the resulting transformed problem is proposed. The method, which is a penalty-based sequential insertion heuristic, allows routes to be constructed by exploiting the tradeoff between material handling and resource starvation costs. The steps of the method are illustrated via a comprehensive example and results on benchmark problems are reported.	material handling	Manolis N.

The chain consists of a producer, a transport operator, and a number of customers. Optimization decomposition techniques use (dual) prices of resources to coordinate the generation of different plans in the so called sub-problems. We argue that these dual prices and generated plans can enhance the multi-agent based approach. By using the agent technology, we can better resemble the interactions between real planners reallocating resources. A transport chain within the food industry has been selected for validating the developed solution method.	agent-based model;decision support system;experience;experiment;interaction;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;program optimization	Jan A.

Thus, the future research trends in this field should focus on methods that can bridge the gap between theory and applications. Based on the review, this paper concludes that it may be helpful if the problem is studied in a viewpoint of control theory and hence, solved by combining enumeration and heuristic instead of using mathematical programming formulations.	control theory;heuristic;long short-term memory;mathematical optimization;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing)	Naiqi Wu;Yanming Qian;Mengchu Zhou;Feng Chu	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384561	job shop scheduling;oil refinery;flow shop scheduling;scheduling	Robotics	11.103251622273307	2.5749166743060976	186393

Each node that has a specified amount of demands can be connected to one of p hubs. The uncapacitated single allocation p-hub maximal covering problem is to maximize the logistics covered, where the logistics of demand is said to be covered if the distance between two nodes is less than or equal to the specified range in consideration of the distance savings between hubs. The aim of our model is to locate the hub, and to allocate non-hub nodes to the located hub nodes; the hub can maximize the demand covered by deadline traveling time. It is presented an integer programming formulation for the new hub covering model, and a computational study based on several instances derived from the CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) data set. Two heuristics, distance based allocation and volume based allocation methods, are suggested with a computational experiment on the CAB data set. Performances of heuristics are evaluated, and it is shown that good solutions are found in a relatively reasonable computation time for most of instances.	covering problems;maximal set;usb hub	Young Ha Hwang;Young Hoon Lee	2012	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2012.03.014	mathematical optimization;engineering;operations management;heuristics;transport engineering	DB	16.260396243178644	3.3491553391976643	187574
e0e06a4739caf2df07d230690c6918b4496e82be	a hybrid method for structural system reliability-based design optimization and its application to trusses	failure sequence;system reliability;design optimization;truss;genetic algorithm;neural network	Most research studies on structural optimum design have focused on single-objective optimization of deterministic structures, while little study has been carried out to address multi-objective optimization of random structures. Statistical parameters and redundancy allocation problems should be considered in structural optimization. In order to address these problems, this paper presents a hybrid method for structural system reliability-based design optimization (SRBDO) and applies it to trusses. The hybrid method integrates the concepts of the finite element method, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, and genetic algorithms. The finite element method was used to compute structural responses under random loads. The RBF neural networks were employed to approximate structural responses for the purpose of replacing the structural limit state functions. The system reliabilities were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation method together with the trained RBF neural networks. The optimal parameters were obtained by genetic algorithms, where the system reliabilities were converted into penalty functions in order to address the constrained optimization. The hybrid method applied to trusses was demonstrated by two examples which were a typical 10-bar truss and a steel truss girder structure. Detailed discussions and parameter analysis for the failure sequences such as web-bucking failure and beam-bending failure in the SRBDO were given. This hybrid method provides a new idea for SRBDO of trusses.

A typical wafer production process consists of several hundred steps with numerous resources including equipment and operating staff. A reasonable assignment of each resource at each time for a certain number of wafers is vital for an efficient production process. Several requirements defined by the customers and facility management must be taken into consideration with the objective to find the best trade-off between the different needs.  In this paper we describe the development of a combined dispatching policy allowing the company to set up multiple objectives and generating the best compromise between different requirements.

4aa86684e392d33628bc3c5437247431f4906f3e	is osm good enough for vehicle routing? a study comparing street networks in vienna		As a result of OpenStreetMap’s (OSM) openness and wide availability, there is increasing interest in using OSM street network data in routing applications. But due to the heterogeneous nature of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in general and OSM in particular, there is no universally valid answer to questions about the quality of these data sources. In this paper we address the lack of systematic analyses of the quality of the OSM street network for vehicle routing and the effects of using OSM rather than proprietary street networks in vehicle routing applications. We propose a method to evaluate the quality of street networks for vehicle routing purposes which compares relevant street network features as well as computed route lengths and geometries using the Hausdorff distance. The results of our case study comparing OSM and the official Austrian reference graph in the city of Vienna show close agreement of one-way street and turn restriction information. Comparisons of 99,000 route pairs with an average length of 6,812 m show promising results for vehicle routing applications with OSM, especially for route length computation where we found median absolute length differences of 1.0%.	computation;geographic information system;hausdorff dimension;one-way function;openstreetmap;openness;vehicle routing problem;volunteered geographic information	Anita Graser;Markus Straub;Melitta Dragaschnig	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11879-6_1	geography;telecommunications;transport engineering;cartography	HCI	15.57884119102275	0.0696768314134567	188326
200e26c5bf6ebad0b56fe7a4fe7905bf4bdb7a32	type-e parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem: mathematical model and ant colony optimisation based approach with optimised parameters	response surface methodology;ant colony optimisation;type e assembly line balancing;parallel two sided assembly lines;artificial intelligence;article	There are many factors which affect the performance of a complex production system. Efficiency of an assembly line is one of the most important of these factors since assembly lines are generally constructed as the last stage of an entire production system. Parallel two-sided assembly line system is a new research domain in academia though these lines have been utilised to produce large sized products such as automobiles, trucks, and buses in industry for many years. Parallel two-sided assembly lines carry practical advantages of both parallel assembly lines and two-sided assembly lines. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce type-E parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem for the first time in the literature and to propose a new ant colony optimisation based approach for solving the problem. Different from the existing studies on parallel assembly line balancing problems in the literature, this paper aims to minimise two conflicting objectives, namely cycle time and number of workstations at the same time and proposes a mathematical model for the formal description of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which addresses both conflicting objectives on a parallel two-sided assembly line configuration. The developed ant colony optimisation algorithm is illustrated with an example to explain its procedures. An experimental design is also conducted to calibrate the parameters of the proposed algorithm using response surface methodology. Results obtained from the performed computational study indicate that minimising cycle time as well as number of workstations help increase system efficiency. It is also observed that the proposed algorithm finds promising results for the studied cases of type-E parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem when the results are compared with those obtained from other three well-known heuristics. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These functions multiply a weight to the cost of fulfilling the demand of a customer which depends on the position of that cost relative to the costs of fulfilling the demand of the other customers. In this paper a reformulated and more compact version of a covering model for the discrete ordered median problem (DOMP) is considered. It is shown that by using this reformulation better solution times can be obtained. This is especially true for some objectives that are often employed in location theory. In addition, the covering model is extended so that ordered median functions with negative weights are feasible as well. This type of modeling weights has not been treated in the literature on the DOMP before. We show that several discrete location problems with equity objectives are particular cases of this model. As a result, a mixed-integer linear model for this type of problems is obtained for the first time.		Alfredo Marín;Stefan Nickel;Sebastian Velten	2010	Math.

d83171ce759cd39c9a24085a8470f044dc523bb6	corridor selection and fine tuning for the corridor method	response surface methodology;container terminal;genetic algorithm;hybrid algorithm	In this paper we present a novel hybrid algorithm, in which ideas from the genetic algorithm and the GRASP metaheuristic are cooperatively used and intertwined to dynamically adjust a key parameter of the corridor method, i.e., the corridor width, during the search process. In addition, a fine-tuning technique for the corridor method is then presented. The response surface methodology is employed in order to determine a good set of parameter values given a specific problem input size. The effectiveness of both the algorithm and the validation of the fine tuning technique are illustrated on a specific problem selected from the domain of container terminal logistics, known as the blocks relocation problem, where one wants to retrieve a set of blocks from a bay in a specified order, while minimizing the overall number of movements and relocations. Computational results on 160 benchmark instances attest the quality of the algorithm and validate the fine tuning process. 1 The Corridor Method: An Introduction The Corridor Method (CM) has been presented by [1] as a hybrid metaheuristic, linking together mathematical programming techniques with heuristic schemes. As illustrated in [2], the basic idea of the CM relies on the use of an exact method over restricted portions of the solution space of a given problem. Given an optimization problem P , the basic ingredients of the method are a very large feasible space X , and an exact method M that could easily solve problem P if the feasible space were not too large. Since, in order to be of interest, problem P is assumed to be hard, the direct application of M to solve P usually becomes unpractical when dealing with real world as well as large scale instances. The CM defines method-based neighborhoods, in which a neighborhood is build taking into account the method M used to explore it. Given a current feasible solution x ∈ X , the CM builds a neighborhood of x, say N (x), which can effectively be explored by employing M . Ideally, N (x) should be exponentially large and built in such a way that it could be explored in (pseudo) polynomial time using M . In this sense the CM closely relates to very large scale neighborhood search as well as the so-called dynasearch; see, e.g., [3, 4]. Typically, the corridor around an incumbent solution is defined by imposing exogenous constraints on the original problem. The effect of such constraints is to identify a limited portion of the search space. The selection of which portions of the search space should be discarded can be driven by a number of factors, in primis, as the power of the method itself deployed to explore the resulting neighborhood. However, one could also envision the design of a stochastic mechanism that, after dividing the search space in portions, or limited regions, selects which of these subspaces should be included in the current corridor. Factors such as, e.g., a greedy score, the cardinality of each subregion, etc., could be used to bias the stochastic selection mechanism that drives the definition of the corridor around the incumbent solution. The stochastic mechanism could be designed such that, on the one hand, the corridor selection is non-deterministic, so that at every step different corridors around the same incumbent solution could be created and, on the other hand, such selection is still influenced by a merit score, accounting for the attractiveness of each portion of the search space. Following such cooperative greedy stochastic corridor construction process, a balance between diversification and intensification is achieved, since, even though more promising regions of the search space have higher probabilities of being selected, not necessarily the best subregions will always be chosen. In the next sections we will illustrate how this cooperative idea can be employed to design an effective algorithm for a well-known problem arising, e.g., at container ports. First, we illustrate the problem; then the algorithm is described, and subsequently numerical results are presented. More details about the problem as well as the steps of the algorithm are provided in [2]. 2 The Blocks Relocation Problem Relocation is one of the most important factors contributing to the productivity of operations at storage yards or warehouses [5]. A common practice aimed at effectively using limited storage space is to stack blocks along the vertical direction, whether they be maritime containers, pallets, boxes, or steel plates [6]. Given a heap of blocks, relocation occurs every time a block in a lower tier must be retrieved before blocks placed above it. Since blocks in a stack can only be retrieved following a LIFO (Last In First Out) discipline, in order to retrieve the low-tier block, relocation of all blocks on top of it will be necessary. Let us consider a bay with m stacks and n blocks. In line with the available literature [6, 7], we introduce the following assumptions: A1: pickup precedences among blocks are known in advance. We indicate the pickup precedence with a number, where blocks with lower numbers have a higher precedence than blocks with higher numbers; A2: when retrieving a target block, we are allowed to relocate only blocks found above the target block in the same stack using a LIFO policy; A3: relocation is allowed only to other stacks within the same bay; A4: relocated blocks can be put only on top of other stacks, i.e., no rearrangement of blocks within a stack is allowed. In the literature, the problem of arranging containers to maximize efficiency is extensively discussed; see, e.g., [8] for a recent survey on quantitative approaches to container terminal logistics. One approach to the problem is the retrieval problem considering relocations called blocks relocation problem (BRP). If the current configuration of the bay is taken as fixed, one might be interested in finding a sequence of moves to be executed, while retrieving blocks according to a given sequence, in order to minimize the overall number of relocation moves. While in the shuffling problems containers are rearranged but not removed, in this version of the problem, at each step, a container is removed from the bay, hence reducing the number of containers in the bay until all containers have been picked up from the bay. Exact as well as approximate algorithms have been proposed to minimize the number of relocations while retrieving blocks (see, e.g., [9–12, 6, 7]). In this paper, we present an enhanced algorithm for the BRP. The algorithm is made up of (i) a corridor definition phase, during which exogenous constraints are imposed to construct a corridor around the incumbent solution; (ii) a neighborhood design and exploration phase, where the corridor is used to define the boundaries of the neighborhood to be explored; (iii) a move evaluation and selection phase, where a greedy rule is used to evaluate the fitness of the solutions in the neighborhood and to select a restricted pool of elite solutions and, finally, (iv) a trajectory fathoming phase, in which a logical test is employed to determine whether the current trajectory can be pruned without loosing any improving solution. The major contribution of the paper is two-fold: on the one hand, we propose an effective way of enhancing the performance of a CM based algorithm by hybridizing such algorithm with ideas from genetic algorithms (GA) and GRASP; on the other hand, it is the first time that a statistically sound attempt to fine tune a CM inspired algorithm is carried out, hence contributing to the realm of metaheuristic calibration and fine tuning. Let us first describe how the CM can be applied to the BRP. The basic idea of the CM is related to the imposition of exogenous constraints upon the original problem, such that the search space is reduced. Given an incumbent bay configuration T , the goal of the BRP is to retrieve the block with highest priority in the bay. However, due to the LIFO policy assumption, whenever such target block is not in the uppermost tier of a stack, i.e., whenever other blocks are currently placed upon the target block, relocation operations will first be required in order to finally retrieve the target block. Given the uppermost block currently located in the same stack of the target, a decision regarding where to relocate such block must be made. Obviously, such decision affects the future retrieval process, since the relocated block might be placed on top of other blocks and, therefore, it might imply the need of further relocations in the next steps. The size of the search space describing all the possible relocations of a set of blocks grows exponentially with respect to the number of blocks moved at each step. A simple way to limit the size of the search space describing the possible configuration that can be reached starting from the initial bay configuration is to impose “constraints,” or limitations, upon the use of stacks. Let us suppose we are given a bay with m stacks. This implies that, when a relocation of a block l is required to retrieve a target block k, block l can be placed on top of any stack different from the one where it is currently located, i.e., m − 1 possible relocations arise. In turn, all of these m−1 possible scenarios give raise to m−1 new configurations, with an exponential growth in the number of configurations. However, let us assume that, whenever a relocation of a block is required in order to retrieve a target block, we are allowed to move such block on only δ < m of the available m−1 stacks, hence creating δ different configurations. Figuratively, we could say that such exogenous constraint builds a horizontal corridor around the incumbent configuration, determining which configurations can be reached starting from the incumbent one. The value of parameter δ can be used to control the width of the corridor and, therefore, the growth of the search space. In a similar fashion, a second parameter λ can be used to i	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;diversification (finance);emoticon;feasible region;grasp;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;hybrid algorithm;information;logistics;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;optimization problem;procedural generation;programming paradigm;randomness;relocation (computing);response surface methodology;rule 184;software release life cycle;stack (abstract data type);statistical model;stochastic process;time complexity	Marco Caserta;Stefan Voß	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11169-3_12	mathematical optimization;response surface methodology;genetic algorithm;hybrid algorithm;computer science;machine learning	AI	17.243020103275796	0.9020026223331751	190308

In the DCFRPC, the capacity of each AGV and buffer is a fixed and finite number, and conflict-free routing must be achieved.

We work on minimizing the transportation cost in a network by loading trucks in the supplier locations and then route them either directly to the customers or indirectly to cross-docking facilities so the loads can be consolidated. For generating a truck operating plan in this type of distribution network, the problem was formulated using an integer programming (IP) model and solved using a novel ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. We solved several numerical examples for verification and demonstrative purposes and found that our proposed approach finds solutions that significantly reduce the shipping cost in the network of cross-docks and considerably outperform Branch-and-Bound algorithm especially for large problems. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The current practice at airports is to land approaching aircraft on a first-come, first-served basis. An active rescheduling of aircraft landing times increases runway capacity or reduces delays. The problem of finding an optimal schedule for aircraft landings is referred to as the “aircraft landing problem”. The objective is to minimize the total delay of aircraft landings or the respective cost. The necessary separation time between two operations must be met. Due to the complexity of this scheduling problem, recent research has been focused on developing heuristic solution approaches. This article presents a new algorithm that is able to create optimal landing schedules on multiple independent runways for aircraft with positive target landing times and limited time windows. Our numerical experiments show that problems with up to 100 aircraft can be optimally solved within seconds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

(etude des problèmes de réservation de voies dans un réseau de transport)		The concept of lane reservation has been introduced as a traffic management strategy and has many applications in real life. Previous studies in the literature mainly focus on the impact of lane reservation in a local region of a transportation network. In this thesis, several lane reservation problems are studied with the objective to minimize impact on total traffic by optimally setting reserved lanes in a transportation network. We firstly focus on the lane reservation problem (LRP) for automated truck freight transportation with static link travel time. This primary work is extended to the capacitated lane reservation problem (CLRP) for large-scale special events. Finally, the lane reservation problem with time-dependent travel time (LRP-TT), and the lane reservation problem with time-dependent travel speed (LRP-TS) are studied. For each of the considered problems, appropriate mathematical models are formulated, their complexities are demonstrated. Different resolution methods are explored, including exact cut-and-solve method, cut-and-solve and cutting plane combined method, and tabu search method. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by randomly generated instances. Numerical results have shown that the proposed algorithms are more effective to solve the considered problems than the commercial package CPLEX.	algorithm;bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;cplex;cutting-plane method;mathematical model;numerical method;procedural generation;real life;tabu search	Yunfei Fang	2013				AI	15.279797563590208	1.9684963658717913	191251

Shop floor lot-sizing and scheduling is one of the most challenging and rewarding subjects for the management. In this study, a two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to solve a single-machine, multi-product shop floor lot-sizing and scheduling problem. Two sources of uncertainties are considered simultaneously: product demand from the market, and workforce efficiency, which is the major contribution of this study. The workforce efficiency affects the system productivity, and we propose different distributions to model its uncertainty with insufficient information.The model aims to determine optimal lot sizes and the production sequence that minimizes expected total system costs over the planning horizon, including setup, inventory, and production costs. A case study is performed on a supply chain producing brake equipment in the automotive industry. The numerical results illustrate the usefulness of the stochastic model under volatile environment, and the solution quality is analyzed.

5ce54803b0143cbdf95b5f9073b43f350e480ff5	learning traffic congestion by contextual bandit problems for optimum localization		Optimum localization problem, which has a wide range of application areas in real life such as emergency services, command and control systems, warehouse localization, shipment planning, aims to find the best location to minimize the arrival, response or return time which might be vital in some applications. In most of the cases, uncertainty in traffic is the most challenging issue and in the literature generally it is assumed to obey a priori known stochastic distribution. In this study, problem is defined as the optimum localization of ambulances for emergency services and traffic is modeled to be Markovian to generate context data. Unlike the solution methods in the literature, there exists no mutual information transfer between the model and solution of the problem; thus, a contextual multi-armed bandit learner tries to determine the underlying traffic with simple assumptions. The performance of the bandit algorithm is compared with the performance of a classical estimation method in order to show the effectiveness of the learning approach on the solution of the optimum localization problem.	algorithm;control system;multi-armed bandit;mutual information;network congestion;real life	Umitcan Sahin;Veysel Yücesoy;Aykut Koç;Cem Tekin	2017	2017 25th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2017.7960447	computer science;existential quantification;mutual information;command and control;markov process;artificial intelligence;context model;machine learning;traffic congestion	Robotics	14.462002058006798	-1.6121401484230586	191819

9faa0dc331d3a80d99cf883d567137f222c23cbf	uncapacitated p-hub location problem with fixed costs and uncertain flows	uncertain measure;p p hub location problem;uncertain variable;chance constrained programming;expected value model	Hub location problem is an important problem and has many applications in various areas, such as transportation and telecommunication. Since the problem involves long-term strategic decision, the future flows will change with time. However, it is difficult or costly to obtain the data of flows, which implies that it is necessary to consider hub location problems in the absence of data. A commonly used way is to estimate future flows by experts’ subjective information. As a result, this paper presents a new uncapacitated \(p\)-hub location problem, in which the flows are described by uncertain variables. Two uncertain programming models are formulated to respectively minimize the expected cost and the \(\alpha \)-cost with the corresponding constraints. Equivalent forms are given when the information about uncertainty distributions of flows is further provided. A genetic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed models and its effectiveness is illustrated by numerical examples.	usb hub	Zhongfeng Qin;Yuan Gao	2017	J.

32ee29b0a4d9f02dba3ba9331cd1f41e0745cc2c	tabu search heuristic for competitive base station location problem		We consider the following location problem. New 5G networks are deployed by two competitive operators (called resp. O1 and O2), which we refer to as a leader and a follower due to their sequential entering the market. They compete to serve clients by installing and configuring base stations (BS). We assume that the leader had already made a decision and operating a 5G network. Follower arrives at the market knowing the decision of the leader and set it’s own 5G network. Follower is able to set up his BS on all the available cites. It is also possible to share the cite with the leader. In the latter case follower pays leader an additional sharing price. Each client choose the network considering the average quality of the service provided. The aim of the follower is to choose locations for his BS in order to maximize his profit.	computation;heuristic;mathematical model;tabu search	Marceau Coupechoux;Ivan A.

Some tour spots have charging facilities for the vehicle battery to be charged during the tour. Our scheduler finds a multi-day visiting sequence, permitting different day-by-day start and end points. To exploit genetic algorithms for the extremely vast search space, a feasible schedule is encoded to an integer-valued vector having n+m-1 elements, where n is the number of places to visit and m is the number of tour days. The cost function evaluates the waiting time, namely, the time amount the tourist must wait for the battery to be charged enough to reach the next place. It also integrates the time budget constraint and quantizes the tour length. The performance measurement result obtained from a prototype implementation shows that our scheme achieves 100 % schedulability until 13 places for the 2-day trip and 17 places for the 3-day trip on given parameter setting.	scheduling (computing)	Junghoon Lee;Gyung-Leen Park	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-44949-9_11	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	13.0620649911286	1.2263490704069515	193670

This paper investigates the multiple yard crane scheduling problem within a generic yard block and considers the operational restrictions such as the crane noncrossing constraint and models the crane travel time realistically. Further, the fact that any two adjacent cranes must keep an operational safety distance is also taken into consideration. These physical constraints limit the mobility of yard cranes and greatly render the scheduling difficulty for such pieces of equipment.This paper proposes a clustering-reassigning approach, which fully considers all of the operational constraints in practice. The complexity of the approach is o ( n 3 ), where n is the number of container moves to be scheduled, making it suitable for real-time scheduling. Numerical experiments and benchmark with a continuous time-based mixed-integer linear programming model indicate that the clustering-reassigning approach can provide satisfactory near optimal solutions for different sets of test cases in a real-time scheduling context.	interference (communication)	Yong Wu;Wenkai Li;Matthew E.

The subproblem is typically a so-called constrained shortest path problem and solved by dynamic programming. However, complex airline regulations arising frequently in European airlines cannot be expressed entirely in this framework and limit the use of pure column generation. In this paper, we formulate the subproblem as a constraint satisfaction problem, thus gaining high expressiveness. Each airline regulation is encoded by one or several constraints. An additional constraint which encapsulates a shortest path algorithm for generating columns with negative reduced costs is introduced. This constraint reduces the search space of the subproblem significantly. Resulting domain reductions are propagated to the other constraints which additionally reduces the search space. Numerical results based on data of a large European airline are presented and demonstrate the potential of our approach.	column generation;constraint programming	Torsten Fahle;Ulrich Junker;Stefan E.

ec3f59f2d54adef29f8b265ad5399caa500e16f2	from problem structuring to optimization: a multi-methodological framework to assist the planning of medical training		Abstract Medical training is an intricate and long process, which is compulsory to medical practice and often lasts up to twelve years for some specialties. Health stakeholders recognise that an adequate planning is crucial for health systems to deliver necessary care services. However, proper planning needs to account for complexity related with the setting of medical school vacancies and of residency programs, which are highly influenced by multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives and views, as well as by the specificities of medical training. Aiming at building comprehensive models with a potential to assist health decision-makers, this article develops a multi-methodological framework to assist the planning of medical training under such a complex environment. It combines the structuring of the objectives and specificities of the medical training problem with a Soft Systems Methodology through the CATWOE (Customer, Actor, Transformation, Weltanschauung , Owner, Environment) approach, and the formulation of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model that considers all relevant aspects. Considering the specificities of countries based on a National Health Service structure, a multi-objective planning model emerges, informing on how many vacancies should be opened/closed per year in medical schools and in each specialty. This model aims at (i) minimizing imbalances between medical demand and supply; (ii) minimizing costs; and (iii) maximizing equity across medical specialties. A case study in Portugal is explored so as to illustrate the applicability of the proposed multi-methodology, showing the relevance of proper structuring for planning models having the potential to inform health decision-makers and planners in practice.

During airlines daily operations, assigning the available gates to the arriving aircrafts based on the fixed schedule is a very important issue, which motivates researchers to study and solve Airport Gate Assignment Problems (AGAP) with all kinds of state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization techniques. In this paper, we study the AGAP and propose a novel hybrid mathematical model based on the method of constraint programming and 0 1 mixed-integer programming. With the objective to minimize the number of gate conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts assigned to the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical constraints and the binary constraints. For practical considerations, the potential objective of the model is also to minimize the number of gates that airlines must lease or purchase in order to run their business smoothly. We implement the model in the Optimization Programming Language (OPL) and carry out empirical studies with the data obtained from online timetable of Continental Airlines, Houston Gorge Bush Intercontinental Airport IAH, which demonstrate that our model can provide an efficient evaluation criteria for the airline companies to estimate the efficiency of their current gate assignments.	combinatorial optimization;constraint programming;dr. web;experiment;integer programming;köppen climate classification;linear programming;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;open programming language (opl);optimization programming language;purchasing;requirement;schedule;smoothing	Chendong Li	2009	CoRR		constraint programming;simulation;combinatorial optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical model;assignment problem;empirical research;operations research	DB	15.744418883390717	3.1714818336905233	194847

Absent opportunities for capacity expansion, airport congestion can only be mitigated through improvements in the utilization of airport capacity and the implementation of demand management measures. This talk presents an integrated approach that jointly optimizes airport scheduling interventions at the strategic level and the utilization of airport capacity at the tactical level, subject to scheduling and capacity constraints. The capacity utilization part involves controlling the runway configuration and the balance of arrival and departure service rates to minimize congestion costs. The schedule optimization reschedules a subset of flights to reduce the demand-capacity mismatches, while minimizing interference with airline competitive scheduling. We develop an original iterative solution algorithm that integrates an Integer Programming model of scheduling interventions, a Dynamic Programming model of capacity utilization, and a Stochastic Queuing Model of airport congestion. The algorithm is shown to converge in reasonable computational times. Computational results for JFK Airport suggest that very substantial delay reductions can be achieved through limited changes in airline schedules. It is also shown that the proposed integrated approach to airport congestion mitigation performs significantly better than the typical sequential approach where scheduling and operational decisions are made separately.

This requires pools of bicycles to be located near each transit stop where commuters can drop off and pick up shared bikes. We study the optimal sizing of such bicycle pools. While various problems related to vehicle pool sizing have been studied before, to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that considers a multimodal transportation system with a regularly scheduled public transportation backbone and shared bicycles for the first and last mile. We present two solutions that guarantee bicycle availability with high probability, and we empirically verify their effectiveness using Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to a baseline solution, our techniques reduce the size of the bikeshare pool at the public transit station from 39% to 75% in the tested scenarios.	baseline (configuration management);blocking (computing);erlang (unit);internet backbone;last mile;monte carlo method;multimodal interaction;simulation;steady state;with high probability	Guoming Tang;Srinivasan Keshav;Lukasz Golab;Kui Wu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2018.2814583	last mile;public transport;simulation;work locations;monte carlo method;sizing;transport engineering;engineering;schedule	Visualization	13.02247390143293	0.6430813599122359	195738

In the classical OPTW each candidate point of interest is associated with a profit value, and the objective is to maximize the total profit. In this study, we extend the problem and allow each point to have multiple profit values, which could reflect different aspects of consideration. We propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the multiobjective OPTW (MOOPTW) with the goal of finding the set of Pareto optimal solutions. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to address the MOOPTW with comprehensive numerical experiments. Our algorithm is a decomposition-based one, which decomposes the multiobjective optimization problem into single-objective sub-problems. Pheromone matrices are associated with sub-problems. We also incorporate path-relinking and propose several strategies. We apply our algorithm to solve 76 public benchmark instances and offer the list of non-dominated solutions to facilitate performance comparison in future researches.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;benchmark (computing);complexity;constraint (mathematics);experiment;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;microsoft windows;multi-objective optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;performance rating;point of interest	Yu-Han Chen;Wei-Ju Sun;Tsung-Che Chiang	2015	2015 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI)	10.1109/TAAI.2015.7407130	mathematical optimization;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management	AI	17.143773130713136	1.109247855189862	196138

Most of these models have been further developed to take more complicated situations into account. However, the existing standard models have never been compared computationally according to the criteria used in practice. In this paper, we compare several ambulance location models on coverage and response time criteria. In addition to four standard ambulance location models from the literature, we also present two models that focus on average and expected response times. The computational results show that the Maximum Expected Covering Location Problem (MEXCLP) and the Expected Response Time Model (ERTM) perform the best over all considered criteria. However, as the computation times for ERTM are long, we advice to use the MEXCLP except when response times are more important than coverage.	computation;facility location problem;maximal set;response time (technology);responsiveness;time complexity	Pieter L. van den Berg;J.

a6e1fb5984f6a021b9a11c3976287be75ede978d	a biobjective formulation for filming sport events problem using drones		In this paper we consider the problem of filming sport events, ensuring high quality image transmission to the spectators. A fleet of drones is used to cover the area in which the play takes place and to track all events. Auxiliary drones are used to support filming drones in order to transmit high quality image to the disadvantaged spectators with respect to the event that takes place in a certain instant of time. The main goal is to decide the position of the filming and auxiliary drones, aiming to provide high view satisfaction and, at the same time, minimizing the distance travelled by the drones. The two objectives are in conflict with each other, thus we formulate the problem as a bi-objective mixed integer model. A unique optimal solution does not exist, rather a set of optimal solutions, named Pareto optimal, can be considered efficient.	display resolution;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;unmanned aerial vehicle	Luigi Di Puglia Pugliese;Francesca Guerriero;Enrico Natalizio;Nicola Roberto Zema	2017	2017 9th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications (IDAACS)	10.1109/IDAACS.2017.8095170	simulation;pareto principle;multi-objective optimization;linear programming;drone;computer science	Robotics	14.363660048007029	2.862487840275245	197587

Given the demand by each retailer, appropriate quantities to be procured from the different suppliers must be decided and the routing of the product along the SC must be determined. Care must be taken because, due to losses, the amount of product that will be finally available at the retailers is lower than the amount of product procured. The objective is twofold: minimizing total costs and minimizing product losses. The proposed approach leverages the existence of data on the flows in previous periods. With those observed flows, a Network Data Envelopment Analysis technology is inferred which allows the computing of any feasible operating point. The resulting biobjective optimization problem can be solved using the weighted Tchebycheff method.	mathematical optimization	Sebastián Lozano;Belarmino Adenso-Díaz	2018	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-017-2653-6	mathematical optimization;operating point;total cost;operations management;supply chain;data envelopment analysis;optimization problem;economics	Theory	10.501693844701176	-2.3158344550239347	197716

Some customers are accessible by both vehicle types, whereas others solely by trucks. After introducing an integer programming formulation for the problem, we describe a two-phase heuristic method which extends a classical vehicle routing algorithm. Since it is necessary to solve a combinatorial problem that has some similarities with the generalized assignment problem, we propose an enumerative procedure in which bounds are obtained from a Lagrangian relaxation. The routine provides very encouraging results on a set of test problems.	accessibility;algorithm;two-phase commit protocol;vehicle routing problem	Frédéric Semet	1995	Annals OR	10.1007/BF02098281	mathematical optimization;simulation;truck;lagrangian relaxation;computer science;generalized assignment problem;operations management;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;vehicle routing problem;mathematical model;mathematics;weapon target assignment problem;scheduling	Robotics	16.094064472790187	2.1434524526709495	197837
08df7eb33c5d11693b0db56e2fed83eb80b7f54f	constrained dynamic vehicle routing problems with time windows		This paper tackles two variants of a Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows as real-world applications of several companies in the Canary Islands, Spain. In these dynamic vehicle routing problems, customer requests can be either known at the beginning of the planning horizon or dynamically revealed over it. Particularly, the problems corresponding to a delivery company and a vending machines company are taken into consideration. In addition to the dynamism feature of these problems, the companies consider several attributes that consist of a fixed heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, multiple time windows, customers priorities and vehicle–customer constraints. This work proposes a metaheuristic procedure to solve these problems. The computational experiments indicate that the proposed method is feasible to solve these real-world problems.	microsoft windows;vehicle routing problem	Jésica de Armas;Belén Melián-Batista	2015	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-014-1574-4	mathematical optimization;simulation;operations research	Robotics	15.650824051288504	2.0020164726179317	198318
98dd939878967c6a7cbed65a493ce19d4c1921a0	direct model-predictive control		Due to simplicity and convenience, Model Predictive Control, which consists in optimizing future decisions based on a pessimistic deterministic forecast of the random processes, is one of the main tools for stochastic control. Yet, it suffers from a large computation time, unless the tactical horizon (i.e. the number of future time steps included in the optimization) is strongly reduced, and lack of real stochasticity handling. We here propose a combination between Model Predictive Control and Direct Policy Search.	computation;mathematical optimization;stochastic control;stochastic process;time complexity	Jean-Joseph Christophe;Jérémie Decock;Olivier Teytaud	2014				Robotics	13.884512465975776	-1.6177241099394024	198425
03b69d391b66a7c6607ef339a242a979997246ab	dynamic airline fleet assignment and integrated modeling		Fleet assignment is a major decision problem of the airline planning process. It assigns fleet types to scheduled flights while maximizing profit. Basic fleet assignment models (FAM) are solved irrespective of other planning steps. Although this yields an optimal assignment solution, it might cause feasibility or profitability issues in dependent planning steps. We provide an overview of strategies for integrating fleet assignment and at least one further planning step.

aaba641513ba75b06b17f8f69a38ab368c76699e	mathematical ranking method for emergency facility location problem with block-wisely different accident occurrence probabilities.		This paper provides a model of emergency facility location problem with block-wise different accident occurrence probabilities comparing our previous one [1]. That is, this paper consider the following problems. (1) There exists a polygonal area X where an ambulance service station should be located and there exists m hospitals. We assume that possible candidates of emergency construction are in X and finite number. If an accident (demand) occurs, the ambulance cars rush to the scene of accident (demand point) and bring the injured persons to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.(2) Demand points are distributed with block-wise uniform probabilities in X. (3) S(Q) denotes the nearest hospital to the point Q X . Weighted A-distance of the route from the station to the hospital via the accident point is considered. (4) For the maximum weighted distance from the station to each block with uniform accident occurrence probability, the satisfaction degree is considered with respect to this distance. (5) We also consider the preference function of the each candidate point. (6) Using these weighted distances, we exploit cross evaluation method [2] as ranking method and calculate the geometric mean score of each candidate point. It should be maximized. Further preference function should be maximum. (7) But since usually there exists no site optimizing both objectives at a time, we seek some non-dominated sites after the definition of non-domination. For the above problem, using Voronoi diagram of hospitals and extending some results of our previous paper ([3]), we propose a solution procedure to find some non-dominated solutions.	autonomous car;dominating set;facility location problem;voronoi diagram	Hiroaki Ishii;Yung Lung Lee	2013		10.1016/j.procs.2013.09.192	data mining	AI	16.449142956170565	3.41197189097307	198749

A refined greedy algorithm is firstly designed to create an initial solution which meets all hard constraints and satisfies some of the soft constraints. The VNS is then used to swap out less promising combinations, continually moving towards a optimal solution until meeting finishing requirements, which are either a satisfactory mean fitness set as a parameter, or a time allowance of one hour. The results of this approach are promising when compared to the stand-alone greedy algorithm, and have showed an average of 10.3% increase in fitness when parameterized with expected demand data and real employee data.	greedy algorithm;mac os x 10.3 panther;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm;paging;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Kenneth N.
