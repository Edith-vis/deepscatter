5d4f4463206a72f7ce78cd0dded51001919b63bf	development of a hybrid learning system based on svm, anfis and domain knowledge: dkfis		This paper presents the development of a hybrid learning system based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and domain knowledge to solve prediction problem. The proposed two-stage Domain Knowledge based Fuzzy Information System (DKFIS) improves the prediction accuracy attained by ANFIS alone. The proposed framework has been implemented on a noisy and incomplete dataset acquired from a hydrocarbon field located at western part of India. Here, oil saturation has been predicted from four different well logs i.e. gamma ray, resistivity, density, and clay volume. In the first stage, depending on zero or near zero and non-zero oil saturation levels the input vector is classified into two classes (Class 0 and Class 1) using SVM. The classification results have been further fine-tuned applying expert knowledge based on the relationship among predictor variables i.e. well logs and target variable - oil saturation. Second, an ANFIS is designed to predict non-zero (Class 1) oil saturation values from predictor logs. The predicted output has been further refined based on expert knowledge. It is apparent from the experimental results that the expert intervention with qualitative judgment at each stage has rendered the prediction into the feasible and realistic ranges. The performance analysis of the prediction in terms of four performance metrics such as correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), and absolute error mean (AEM), scatter index (SI) has established DKFIS as a useful tool for reservoir characterization.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;approximation error;coefficient;inference engine;information system;kerrison predictor;mean squared error;neuro-fuzzy;support vector machine	Soumi Chaki;Aurobinda Routray;William K.

The detection in advance of the degradation of the cutting process is crucial since this can lead to the breakage of the cutting tool (the wire), reducing the process productivity and the required accuracy. Concerning this, previous investigations have identified different types of degraded behaviours in two commonly used workpiece thicknesses (50 and 100mm). This goal was achieved by monitoring different functions of characteristic discharge variables. However, the thresholds achieved by these functions depended on the thickness of the workpiece. Consequently, the main objective of this work is to detect the degradation of the process when machining workpiece of different thicknesses using one unique empirical model. Since artificial neural network techniques are appropriate for stochastic and non-linear nature processes, its use is investigated here to cope with workpieces of different thicknesses. The results of this work show a satisfactory performance of the presented approach. The satisfactory performance is shown by two ratios: the validation ratio, which ranges between 85% and 100%, and the test ratio, which results between 75% and 100%.

The actual disaster may befall almost instantaneously, triggered by a single event, but all accidents have a long prior history of errors and compromises. AI techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms and influence diagrams, can be used to detect this kind of incremental degradation in the automated process before it rises up to bite us. However, its correction depends on human awareness of, and thoughtful judgment about, the consequences of these myriad small decisions. An EPRI project in the nuclear generation area is trying to develop a set of leading indicators-measures that provide advance information about the health of the overall system based on a review of the organization’s human performance. Another project is aimed toward the development of a software tool to help its user link the cause of a problem to an appropriate corrective action. AI is also ideal for the mid-term optimization of the bottom line, as demanded by the owners of the automated plant. Neural networks excel at the short-term prediction needed for anticipatory feed-forward control actions. By cascading a nonlinear adaptive filter based on neural networks with the (inevitably) nonlinear plant, the filter can learn to drive the plant as if it were the plant’s inverse.
