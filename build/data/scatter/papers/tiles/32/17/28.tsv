Predicting vehicular visiting time is vital to both solving the vehicular system problem and building efficient vehicular networking. It is an open and unsolved problem that how much the vehicular staying duration of visits to different areas can be predicted. In this paper, we use real vehicular traces in Beijing and Shanghai and an area partition model to explore the limit of predictability of the vehicular visiting time in different areas in large scale cities and analyze the effect of different precision and slot time on predictability. We conclude that using a proper time slot is an efficient way of prediction and a higher predictability can be achieved if the requirement for precision is reduced. Among all the cases we study, we find the highest potential predictability in Beijing and Shanghai in the case with smallest slot time and lowest requirement for precision.	algorithm;network congestion;telecommunications network;tracing (software)	Wenyu Ren;Yong Li;Siyu Chen;Depeng Jin;Li Su	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554815	simulation;vehicular communication systems;computer security	Mobile	4.136126213911267	89.00755546172249	199412
