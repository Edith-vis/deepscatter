ea30b90a1be929b864f8c460e3a796d803b6ed7f	maximization of returns under an average value-at-risk constraint in fuzzy asset management		A portfolio allocation model is discussed in asset management with fuzziness. By perception-based extension for fuzzy random variables, the estimation methods of asset risks are introduced. Introducing an average value-at-risk for fuzzy random variables, this paper formulates a portfolios allocation model with average value-at-risks. This paper discusses maximization of the expected return under an average value-at-risk constraint with fuzzy random variables. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the results. c 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1f1afea6fc5bab1a23822ef4b44fc5e3e5d948d5	an improved method for forecasting spare parts demand using extreme value theory	forecasting;semi parametric;inventory;extreme value theory;spare parts	Inventory control for spare parts is essential for many organizations due to the trade-off between preventing high holding cost and stockouts. The lead time demand distribution plays a central role in inventory control. The estimation of this distribution is problematic as the spare part demand is often intermittent, and as a consequence often only a limited number of non-zero data points are available in practice. The well-known empirical method uses historical demand data to construct the lead time demand distribution. Although it performs reasonably well when service requirements are relatively low, it has difficulties in achieving high target service levels. In this paper, we improve the empirical method by applying extreme value theory to model the tail of the lead time demand distribution. To make the most out of a limited number of demand observations, we establish that extreme value theory can be applied to lead time demand periods computed over overlapping intervals. We consider two service levels: the expected waiting time and cycle service level. Our experiments show that our method improves the inventory performance compared to the empirical method and is competitive with the WSS method, Croston’s method and SBA for a range of demand distributions.	extreme value theory	Sha Zhu;Rommert Dekker;Willem van Jaarsveld;Rex Wang Renjie;Alex J.

An attacker tries to maximize the system vulnerability (probability of total destruction). The attacker distributes its constrained resource optimally across two attacks and chooses the number of elements to be attacked in the first attack. The attacker observes which elements are destroyed and not destroyed in the first attack, and applies its remaining resource into attacking the remaining elements in the second attack. First the optimal attack strategy against a system with a fixed number of elements is analyzed. Thereafter a minmax two period game between the attacker and the defender is considered in which the defender distributes its constrained resource between deploying redundant elements and protecting them against the attack. & 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

e0dda9f27d6641f0b80f0d808fdb618000153034	optimal program for autonomous driving under bentham- and nash-type social welfare functions		The purpose of this paper is to formally define and solve ethical problems of how an artificial vehicle (AV) determines its driving behavior when there are some passengers in the AV and some pedestrians on a street. We construct a mathematical model introducing mainly two Benthamand Nash-types social welfare functions, and derive optimal solutions. We show the optimal solutions are completely different depending on the functions and their parameters. Our contribution is that policymakers or managers of AVs can discuss the problem and determine an algorithm for autonomous driving by formalizing the situation and offering the optimal solutions. © 2016 The Authors.

The analysis was done on the basis of the total actual data which were possible to acquire from 11 thermal power stations in Kyushu area for the past 17 years. The dimensional reduction method was applied with suitable modifications in order to overcome the problems due to the unavailability of sufficient data under many different operational environments of power system pumps. The problem of the band-limited nature of the time-to-failure data was solved by extrapolating the future failures using the Weibull distribution, from currently available data which represented only a short time window with respect to their total lifetime. System availability was formulated as a series-parallel array pump system by taking into account the time for repair and maintenance and was used to estimate the maintenance scheduling of...	scheduling (computing)	Priyantha Kumarawadu	1999	Int.

The high needs of workforce flexibility combined with disseminated ag encies have led some companies to a great number of labor suppliers. Thi s situation has produced important cost variation, poor quality of service, and important risk due to the mistunderstanding by local managers of legal consid erations. To face this situation, companies have started to move from a HR consideration to a purchasing one. This paper deal with the problem of sourcing contingent workers as a supply chain mangement issue: to secur e and optimise the sourcing of non permanent workers, companies need t o involve different departments within the organisation and to develop an optimise business process with some prefered suppliers. A case study developped with Wincanton finally illustrates the benefit of identifying the needs and outsourcing to a unique service provider such a sourcing process.	business process;contingency (philosophy);half rate;outsourcing;purchasing;quality of service	Gilles Neubert;Philippe Adjadj	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-16358-6_25	service level objective;business service provider;service delivery framework;operations management;business;commerce	ML	5.939452285958472	-4.65610778094364	154885

The cold and harsh climate, the long distance from customer and suppliers’ markets, and the sensitive environment may have considerable influence on the choice of design solutions and production performance characteristics such as throughput capacity, reliability, availability, maintainability, and supportability (RAMS) as well as operational and maintenance activities. Due to this, data and information collected for similar systems used in a normal climate may not be suitable. Hence, it is important to study and develop methods for prediction of the production performance characteristics during the design and operation phases.#R##N##R##N#The aim of this paper is to present an approach for prediction of the production performance for oil and gas production facilities considering influencing factors in Arctic conditions. The proportional repair model (PRM) is developed in order to predict repair rate in Arctic conditions. The model is based on the proportional hazard model (PHM). A simple case study is used to demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied.		Xueli Gao;Javad Barabady;Tore Markeset	2010	Rel. Eng. & Sys.

Selection of market price and product processing cost models is the critical issue discussed in this paper. Key issues and inputs to the thirty five year simulation are briefly discussed. Results for one type of potash found in the WIPP region are presented. Present value distributions for revenues from potash operations and estimated cash flows to a single firm conducting potash extraction were generated using several price/cost model combinations. A simple Wiener process was selected for annual potash market prices, and processing costs were generated using random draws from a uniform distribution. The rationale for selection of this model combination is discussed.	analysis of algorithms;design rationale;key;monte carlo method;simulation;value (ethics)	Peter C.

In this paper, a mixed integer programming model for maximizing the project benefit function has been presented; this model shows the optimum allocation of project managers and project vice managers in multi projects based on their competencies. The competency assignment developed based on Project Management knowledge, Project Management performance and Project Management Personal Competencies. In order to modeling the problem, after gathering the projects information, the model has been simulated using CPLEX software with AMPL language. The developed model will allow description of project managers' competencies and determination of their working hours and positions in each time.	ampl;algorithm;allocative efficiency;cplex;human resource management system;integer programming;linear programming;programming model	Mohammad Hasan Sebt;Vahid Shahhosseini;Mohammad Rezaei	2010	2010 12th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation	10.1109/UKSIM.2010.65	level of effort;basis of estimate;project management;extreme project management;program management;earned value management;software project management;opm3;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;estimation;functional manager;project management 2.0;project management triangle;project charter;schedule;project planning;project portfolio management	Robotics	6.578454284342111	-5.325445968167156	155496

We propose a probabilistic cost model in which suppliers' quality performance is measured by inconformity of the end product measurements and delivery performance is estimated based on the suppliers' expected delivery earliness and tardiness. The model is then empirically tested, utilizing the parameters obtained from one US mechanical component manufacturing company. The results from the case analysis indicate that single sourcing could be a cost effective policy but is not a panacea when the buying firm pursues product quality and delivery excellence. A prerequisite condition for the success of single sourcing practices is a low incoming quality variation within a group of single-source suppliers.		Hojung Shin;W. C.

We extend their result to the infinite-horizon case (for both discounted and average costs). The computations required are far easier than for the finite horizon problem. Further simplification is achieved for normal demands. We also consider the more interesting case of multiple locations at the lower echelon. We show that, under certain conditions, this problem can be closely approximated by a model with one such location. A rather simple computation thus yields both a near-optimal policy and a good approximation of the cost of the system.	approximation algorithm;computation;horizon effect;inventory theory;level of detail;row echelon form	Awi Federgruen;Paul H.

The demand, production and backlogging rates are assumed to be continuous and varying with time. The objective is to find the optimal production restarting and stopping time to keep the total relevant cost as low as possible. To ascertain the optimal solution exists, the conditions for the total relevant cost in the system which attains its global minimum are provided. In addition, based on the minimum total relevant cost, an alternative among the proposed four cases is also suggested. Finally, a numerical example and sensitivity analysis is illustrated and some management insights are presented.		Hui-Ling Yang	2011	Int. J.

Models for planning and policy analyses are used to consider what might occur if the incentives or regulations were different. In these models, however, preferences are usually assumed to be given and stable, and agents are usually assumed to be homogeneous. This paper focuses on the implications of making preferences in models of policy implementation endogenously determined and time varying heterogeneous agents. We consider first the recent literature on intertemporal choice and preference change, which cuts across many disciplines, and more briefly the literature on norm-regarding behavior. We then elaborate a simple model of transportation demand—from a static to a dynamic orientation, from fixed and exogenously given preferences of strictly self-regarding agents to endogenously determined and policy-induced preferences of heterogeneous agents—and illustrate its characteristics with simple numerical examples.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has gained prominence as a solution to this approach. However, issues such as presence of metals and frequency interference hamper its performance and value derived out of its implementation in many environments. To analyze the true value of an RFID system we formulate a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model for RFID directed search to detect misplaced items. A forklift operator (FLO) in a warehouse assigned to locate a misplaced item is guided by the imperfect variations in the strength of the signal received from the RFID tag (active or passive). The POMDP considers five possible FLO actions, five RFID observations in scenarios with different reader-tag signal strength distributions. The results indicate that the POMDP can provide shortest path to locate the tag when RFID signal strength is high . As the signal strength decreases, the signals received (observations) become more dispersed, and the number of steps to reach the tag increases considerably. The expected reward (roughly reduction in search effort) from a 20-step POMDP with high signal strength was 18 times higher than for the low strength (i.e., poor/dispersed observations) model. While even a poorly designed RFID system provides marginal benefits in environments devoid of a sophisticated warehouse management system (WMS), the results show that with the use of WMS (i.e., situations involving strong prior knowledge) adopting a poorly designed RFID system may actually cost the firm more than without it.	interference (communication);inventory;marginal model;markov chain;partially observable markov decision process;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;shortest path problem;warehouse management system	Sharethram Hariharan;Satish T.

49b7d958ddff99f6d596803e875235db37f62d25	an optimal solution of a general lot size inventory model with deteriorated and imperfect products, taking into account inflation and time value of money	optimal solution;mathematical analysis;inventory model;lot sizing;global optimization	This paper considers a general production lot size inventory model with deteriorated and imperfect products taking into account inflation and time value of money. The production, demand, and deterioration rates are known, continuous, and differentiable functions of time. Shortages are allowed, but only a fraction of the stock out is backordered, and the rest is lost. Under these general assumptions, the inventory model is formulated, and a closed form of the total relevant costs of the underlying inventory system is obtained. Sufficient conditions which lead to a minimal solution of the considered problem are derived. Then, a rigorous mathematical analysis is used to prove that such a minimal solution is unique and global-optimal. A numerical verification of the proposed model is also given.	inventory theory;time value of money	Zaid T. Balkhi	2004	Int. J.

The newly developed model is applied to a Subsea Gas Compression System planned for offshore West Africa to predict its reliability index. System technical failure was modelled by developing a Weibull failure model incorporating a physically tested corrosion profile as stress in order to quantify the survival rate of the system under additional operational covariates including marine pH, temperature and pressure. Using Reliability Block Diagrams and enhanced Fusell-Vesely formulations, the whole system was systematically decomposed to sub-systems to analyse the criticality of each component and optimise them. Human reliability was addressed using an enhanced barrier weighting method. A rapid degradation curve is obtained on a subsea system relative to the base case subjected to a time-dependent corrosion stress factor. It reveals that subsea system components failed faster than their Mean time to failure specifications from Offshore Reliability Database as a result of cumulative marine stresses exertion. The case study demonstrated that the reliability of a subsea system can be systematically optimised by modelling the system under higher technical and organisational stresses, prioritising the critical sub-systems and making befitting provisions for redundancy and tolerances.

In practice, the decision maker is often challenged with more complex settings involving multiple decisions and uncertainties. For instance, firms may benefit from choosing the set of customer orders to satisfy. It may also be worthwhile for many firms to select a supply portfolio instead of relying on a single procurement mode. This paper provides novel optimization models and solution techniques that can help businesses to achieve the maximum performance from a given production system by optimally selecting customer demands, procurement quantity, spot market purchase and option contract usage. We specifically focus on the special case of normally distributed random variables, and provide an exact solution method. When the primary procurement quantity is not a decision variable, the problem becomes a version of a Stochastic Knapsack Problem. For this case, we present an efficient heuristic solution algorithm based on properties of an optimal solution and empirically show that it provides high-quality solutions. We also provide a broad numerical study to examine the sensitivity of integrated procurement and demand selection strategies to key problem parameters. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

HSR offer fast and reliable services and good possibilities for work during the journey. Surprisingly, these benefits of HSR investment proposals are often appraised by use of travel-time valuations of people who use conventional (intercity) train services. The standard approach builds on two major assumptions, linearity of demand, and that the value of time is unchanged between the “before” and “after” alternatives, i.e., that change in the average value of time of passengers can be ignored. While the first of these is well known, the second is not always observed. However, the spread of values of time between individual travelers is large and is an essential motivation for HSR investments. This note therefore considers whether the assumption that the value of time remains unchanged by the speed improvement induces any significant bias in the appraisal. We first use a modal-mix model where travelers have varying value of time to outline some conceptual points and then discuss to what extent these may affect the social profitability of three recently constructed or proposed HSR lines: OsloStockholm (Norway and Sweden), Stockholm-Göteborg (Sweden) and Beijing-Shanghai Hongqiao (China). We conclude that a RoHbased evaluation of an HSR line should be complemented by a sensitivity analysis of how the outcome is affected by possible changes of the composition of travelers with different values of time. * Örebro University School of Business, lars.hultkrantz@oru.se.

This paper presents an application of the special purpose simulation (SPS) language using Simphony software to predict the noise levels generated by construction equipment, tools and machinery at a given reception point for a certain barrier length, as well as the related cost of the barrier wall. To illustrate an application of the developed model, an example has been developed for different noise sources and different activities. The information obtained from the simulation model output will help to utilize the model as a planning tool for optimizing the length and location of noise barriers around a construction site. The tool can be useful for a contractor to develop a noise-control plan using mitigation measures that are acceptable to the owner.	ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;mathematical optimization;simulation	Anupama Gannoruwa;Janaka Yasantha Ruwanpura	2007	2007 Winter Simulation Conference		simulation;engineering;transport engineering;noise control	Robotics	8.131062595467993	-5.346506636839968	162998

We develop a microscopic simulation framework to enhance our understanding of the interactions between human-driven vehicles and CAVs in a merging on-ramp scenario. We show that fuel consumption is adversely affected for medium and high traffic while benefits are realized for travel time under the same traffic conditions. We also show that higher penetrations of CAVs contribute to more stable traffic patterns.	addresses (publication format);drug vehicle;interaction;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;traffic analysis;benefit	Andreas A.

3df504f9d6511422cdf36546c6cdd894200ab960	real-time management of the waterflooding process using proxy reservoir modeling and data fusion theory		Abstract Waterflooding is the use of water injection to enhance the oil recovery in mature oil reservoirs. In this paper an adaptive algorithm has been introduced for waterflooding management in oil reservoirs based on proxy modeling technique. The presented approach is capable to handle the time-varying nature and the inherent nonlinearity of the complex process. In addition, any variation either in market prices or in operational costs is compensated by the designed adaptive controller to fix the obtained profit (here, the net present value: npv ) at a desired achievable value. The observed outcomes on 10th SPE-Model#2 benchmark case study have shown that by using this algorithm, any feasible desired trajectory for the expected benefit can be satisfied during the waterflooding-based production. Since the suggested controller has adaptive structure, it can be re-adjusted continuously in each time-step, using available operational data, to take into account the reservoir dynamical variations as well as the external disturbances to present an acceptable performance. By including a monitoring module in the algorithm structure based on data fusion technique, the updated profitability/productivity status of the reservoir is estimated. By using this information the npv setpoint induced to the closed-loop system can be automatically re-adjusted such that it always remains in an acceptable and reasonable range. In conclusion, the proposed methodology is an applicable solution for fairly profit-sharing in different kinds of contracts. In other words, the gained profit can be appropriately allocated to the shareholders according to the contractual obligations or a defined npv trajectory while considering the current condition of the reservoir. This strategy helps to prevent from ultra-production in a specific period of time by the clients or contractors which may lead to an unexpected reduction in the share of other parties in the reservoir life-cycle.	real-time transcription	Farzad Hourfar;Behzad Moshiri;Karim Salahshoor;Ali Elkamel	2017	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.06.018	mathematics;control theory;mathematical optimization;adaptive algorithm;present value;setpoint;adaptive control;reservoir modeling;profitability index;sensor fusion	SE	5.729365281732813	-8.650865855409961	164517
025cdb782a764aaeda1f7aa69f08a1d531310fff	optimal inventory management using retail prepacks		Abstract Many types of retail items are shipped through the supply chain from the manufacturer to the stores in “prepacks,” which may consist of multiple units of the same stock keeping unit (SKU) or combinations of related SKUs packaged together. Prepacks reduce shipping and handling costs in the supply chain, but they can also increase supply - demand imbalances. This paper is the first to develop a general methodology that determines optimal replenishment policies for combinations of different prepacks. The model uses stochastic dynamic programming, and can be solved by a linear program in the steady state case. We formulate the general multi-SKU prepack case and develop specific solutions for the one-SKU and two-SKU prepack cases. A numerical analysis of various one-SKU and two-SKU prepack choices leads to some interesting insights about the optimal design of prepacks from the retailer’s standpoint. Single unit shipments are cost effective only for very low demand rates. Having multiple prepack sizes leads to significant cost savings, relative to a single prepack size. However, the incremental benefits of including larger numbers of different prepacks appear to diminish rapidly. Unless item demands are perfectly correlated, multi-SKU prepacks appear to have only a limited expected cost advantage over optimally chosen single-SKU prepacks. But multi-SKU prepacks can reduce the expected number of prepacks handled per period, which can be an important consideration for distribution centers. The best choices for multi-SKU prepacks can be counterintuitive, and some apparently attractive choices for two-SKU prepacks perform worse than one-SKU prepacks.		Narendra Agrawal;Stephen A.

With the rapid growth in air freight, more studies are needed to examine the growing impact of air freight on air transportation. This paper addresses the optimal baggage-limit policy for airlines. Because much of the cargo is currently transported in the residual aircraft belly space after all of the passenger baggage has been enplaned, it is important for carriers to plan passenger and cargo levels together when setting passenger baggage limits. We formulate this problem as a variant of the price-dependent multi-item newsvendor model with weight-volume capacity constraints. The effects of baggage weight, prices, and costs on the number of passengers and amount of cargo carried are studied. Based on the model and carriers' existing practice, we develop several illustrative cases. Our findings suggest that airlines may be able to increase profits with significant reductions in passenger baggage limits for large aircraft.		Wai Hung Wong;Anming Zhang;Yer Van Hui;Lawrence C.

95530aeaace5491e3b3177c83817ae80ea6e0549	a novel cost estimation approach for wood harvesting operations using symbolic planning		While forestry is an important economic factor, the methods commonly used to estimate potential financial gains from undertaking a harvesting operation are usually based on heuristics and experience. Those methods use an abstract view on the harvesting project at hand, focusing on a few general statistical parameters. To improve the accuracy of felling cost estimates, we propose a novel, single-tree-based cost estimation approach, which utilizes knowledge about the harvesting operation at hand to allow for a more specific and accurate estimate of felling costs. The approach utilizes well-known symbolic planning algorithms which are interfaced via the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and compile work orders. The work orders can then be used to estimate the total working time and thus the estimated cost for an individual harvesting project, as well as some additional efficiency statistics. Since a large proportion of today's harvesting operations are mechanized instead of motor manual, we focus on the planning of harvester and forwarder workflows. However, the use of these heavy forest machines carries the risk of damaging forest soil when repeatedly driving along skidding roads. Our approach readily allows for assessment of these risks.

Instead of a bathtub curve, the desirable shape of a failure rate covering the entire life of a good product, which might be called hockey-stick line, is introduced. From the hockey-stick line and the definition of reliability, two measurements are extracted. The terms r-reliability (failure rate) and durability (product life) are explained. The conceptual analysis of failure mechanics explains that reliability technology pertains to design area. The desirable shape of hazard rate curve of electronic items, hockey-stick line, clarifies that Mean-Time-to-failure (MTTF) as the inverse of failure rate can be regarded a nominal life. And Bx life, different from MTTF, is explained. Reliability relationships between components and set products are explained. Reshaped definitions of r-reliability and durability are recommended. The procedure to improve reliability and the reasons for failing to identify failure mode are clarified in order to search right solutions.

In contrast to most previous approaches, we treat the capacity as a decision variable, and not as given data. This is consistent with many practical cases where additional capacities/resources can be acquired/rented at some cost/profit. Two solution procedures are developed for deriving an optimal policy within the class of policies that has a fixed cycle for all items with phasing of orders within the cycle.

The problems of study are more challenging than those considered in previous works that address only interval objective coefficients, and furthermore the uncertainties are allowed to arise from arbitrarily specified polyhedral sets. To this end a safe approximation of the regret function is developed so that the maximum regret can be evaluated reasonably efficiently by leveraging on previous established results and solution algorithms. The proposed approach is then applied to a two-stage co-production newsvendor problem that contains uncertainties in both supplies and demands. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed regret approximation is reasonably accurate, and the corresponding regret optimization model performs competitively well against other optimization approaches such as worst-case and sample average optimization across different performance measures.	linear programming;regret (decision theory)	Tsan Sheng Ng	2013	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2013.01.014	mathematical optimization;linear programming;machine learning;mathematics;welfare economics;regret	Theory	3.71459466331468	-3.712323599791364	168098
68466e78f38c3c4ccefe88190058e90e38d7146e	analysis of extended warranties for medical equipment: a stackelberg game model using priority queues		Healthcare institutions make use of technology-intensive equipment that follows tight quality standards. These companies aim at ensuring service continuity and safety of patients. In this context, maintenance services are generally performed exclusively by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) because it detains the required expertise, tools and spare parts. Then, we here propose a model to analyze the interaction among hospitals and OEM. We consider the OEM can provide maintenance services for two different classes of hospitals, which have the option of either hiring an Extended Warranty (EW) or paying for each maintenance intervention on demand with or without priority. Class 1 customers are often large hospitals, whereas institutions of class 2 are generally small/medium ones, which have shorter budgets, and thus would choose a non-priority option. To that end, we adopt a Stackelberg game, where the OEM is the leader and the customer is the follower. Failures and repairs follow a 2-class G/M/1 priority queuing system. The OEM maximizes its expected profit by setting the EW and repair intervention prices, and selecting the optimal number of customers in each class. An application example is used to demonstrate the proposed model; a sensitivity analysis is also performed.	priority queue	Márcio das Chagas Moura;João Mateus Santana;Enrique López Droguett;Isis Didier Lins;Bruno Nunes Guedes	2017	Rel.

In this paper we introduce a mathematical programming model that uses total cost of ownership information to simultaneously select suppliers and determine order quantities over a multi-period time horizon. The total cost of ownership quantifies all costs associated with the purchasing process and is based on the activities and cost drivers determined by an activity based costing system. Our approach is motivated by the purchasing problem of heating electrodes at Cockerill Sambre, a Belgian multinational steel producer. In this case quality issues account for more than 70% of the total cost of ownership making the quality of a supplier a critical success factor in the supplier selection process.	purchasing;total cost of ownership	Zeger Degraeve;Filip Roodhooft	1999	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/S0377-2217(97)00383-4	supply;selection;economics;cost–benefit analysis;marketing;operations management;heating element;efficiency;critical success factor;activity-based costing;commerce;profitability index	Robotics	3.509681964250341	-5.516662398841996	168668

This paper is directed at researchers and practicing inventory planners with two objectives. First, we provide several models and algorithms to compute the Expected Shortages When a Stockout Occurs (ESWSO) for a variety of stochastic environments. We show that when ESWSO, is used in conjunction with the traditional fill rate measures it greatly enhances a planners ability to plan for shortages. Second, we develop two cost-minimizing inventory models-one addressing the backorder and the other the shortage scenario-to show how the ESWSO can be seamlessly integrated into an inventory-cost framework to specify lot sizes and safety stocks. Subject Areas: Inventory Models, Logistics, and Probability Models. INTRODUCTION When analyzing a reorder point, order quantity ( K Q) inventory systems, one important question that often gets very little, if any, attention is: When a stockout occurs, how large is it? Traditional solution methods calculate safety stocks based on average “service levels.” An average service level translates to setting safety stocks so that a stockout occasion does not occur in a predetermined fraction of inventory cycles, or to setting safety stocks based on a predetermined fraction of demand that is satisfied off the shelf (Silver & Peterson, 1985). Working with inventory-logistics planners over the years, we have realized that the traditional service-level concept, although very effective, may not be sufficient to plan adequately for shortages. This is especially true, as the ensuing sections will illustrate, in highly uncertain environments characterized by high variance in demand or delivery lead times, or when shortage costs are high. In such situations, it is our	inventory theory;logistics;peterson's algorithm;safety stock	Tonya Boone;Ram Ganeshan	2000	Decision Sciences	10.1111/j.1540-5915.2000.tb00933.x	reorder point;logistics;inventory theory;simulation;economics;marketing;operations management;management science;cycle count	AI	8.023414221588373	-3.5393278301825752	168853

The items are produced in two stages, each with its own lead-time; in the first stage a common intermediate product is manufactured. The production volumes in the first stage are bounded by given capacity limits. We develop an accurate lower bound and close-to-optimal heuristic strategies of simple structure. The gap between them, evaluated in an extensive numerical study, is on average only 0.45%. We use the model to investigate the benefits of various delayed product differentiation (postponement) strategies, as well as other strategic questions, including (i) the benefits of flexible versus dedicated production facilities; (ii) the trade-off between capacity and inventory investments; and (iii) the trade-off between capacity investments and service levels.

We consider the design of a multi-product supply chain, for which each product requires one or more process capabilities and each process can get capacity from multiple resources. We present a single-period model to determine the capacity investments for these resources in the presence of demand uncertainty and option contracts. (We have also extended the model to a multi-period setting in a companion paper) We derive closed-form solutions to two important special cases of the problem and draw managerial insights about the optimal capacity planning strategy. We then develop a stochastic linear programming algorithm to solve the general single period problem and show that our algorithm outperforms alternative algorithms by means of an empirical study. Finally, with the model and algorithm, we study the effects of common processes and option contracts on capacity planning.	algorithm;capability (systems engineering);linear programming	Xin Huang	2008			engineering management;electrical engineering technology;engineering;operations management;industrial engineering	ML	3.73971147895986	-4.904884100781744	169111

As well, classification of the commodity can be carried out according to 8 factors, such as price, delivering cycle, storage life, purchase quantity, sale quantity, transportation cost, seasonality and fragility. Further all commodities are to be classified on the basis of fuzzy clustering theory in combination with the Central-Red supermarket in Harbin. The results of classification can provide some preferences to make procurement plan for retailing enterprises, which enable these enterprises to seek economical and advanced procurement methods on their actual situations and needs.	beowulf cluster;cluster analysis;fuzzy clustering;procurement;seasonality	Yang Li;Lihai Wang	2010	2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569356	statistical classification;computer science;machine learning;cluster analysis	DB	3.528113299340929	-9.493067476521023	170021

Two chance-constrained optimization models were proposed. The models were tested using case studies of an existing gas processing plant. Profit optimization for the case studies was made with respect to the reliability of holding the process constraints at a certain confidence level [0.5, 1]. The optimal profit change for uncertainty from the plant inlet within the confidence interval [0.96, 1] was 86%. On the other hand, the optimal profit change for uncertainty from the plant outlet was only 2% for the same confidence level interval considered. This suggests that the uncertainty from the plant inlet has a major impact on the overall economic performance of the plant. Sensitivity analysis showed how uncertain parameters from both plant sides can affect the overall profit significantly.	material flow;mathematical optimization	Mesfin Getu;Shuhaimi Mahadzir;Moonyong Lee	2013	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2013.05.026	mathematical optimization;profit;uncertainty;engineering;mathematics;management science;operations research;statistics	SE	9.34552508752132	-4.348394095950618	170303

Two results are provided in this paper. First, we present a methodology for approximating stochastic distribution problems that are computationally tractable for problems of realistic size. Comparisons are made to standard deterministic formulations and shown to give superior results. Then, we compare logistics networks with varying degrees of redundancy represented by the number of warehouses which serve each customer. Overlapping service regions for warehouses provides additional exibility to handle real-time demands. We quantify the expected savings that might result from such strategies.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;logistics;real-time clock	Raymond K.-M. Cheung;Warren B.

This type of problem is of general interest in inventory theory and of particular importance in supply chain systems with both end-product demand and spare parts (subassemblies) demand. The multi-echelon inventory system considered here is a combination of assembly and serial stages with direct demand from more than one node. The aspect of multiple sources of demands leads to interesting inventory allocation problems. The demand and capacity at each node are considered stochastic in nature. A fixed supply and manufacturing lead time is used between the stages. We develop mathematical models for these multi-echelon systems, which describe the inventory dynamics and allow simulation of the system. A simulation-based inventory optimization approach is developed to search for the best base-stock levels for these systems. The gradient estimation technique of perturbation analysis is used to derive sample-path estimators. We consider four allocation schemes: lexicographic with priority to intermediate demand, lexiographic with priority to downstream demand, predetermined proportional allocation, and proportional allocation. Based on the numerical results we find that no single allocation policy is appropriate under all conditions. Depending on the combinations of variability and utilization we identify conditions under which use of certain allocation polices across the supply chain result in lower costs. Further, we determine how selection of an inappropriate allocation policy in the presence of scarce on-hand inventory could result in downstream nodes facing acute shortages. Consequently we provide insight on why good allocation policies work well under differing sets of operating conditions.	row echelon form	Suman Niranjan;Frank W.

Despite huge progresses in carbon abatement, few research studies have reported on the impacts of carbon emission reduction mechanisms on manufacturing optimisation, which often leads to decisions of environmentally unsustainable operations and misestimation of performance. This paper attempts to explore carbon management under the carbon emission trading mechanism for optimisation of lot sizing production planning in stochastic make-to-order manufacturing with the objective to maximise shareholder wealth. We are concerned not only about the economic benefits of investors, but also about the environmental impacts associated with production planning. Numerical experiments illustrate the significant influences of carbon emission trading, pricing, and caps on the dynamic decisions of the lot sizing policy. The result highlights the critical roles of carbon management in production planning for achieving both environmental and economic benefits. It also provides managerial insights into operations management to help mitigate environmental deterioration arising from carbon emission, as well as improve shareholder wealth. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

Consequently a wide variety of fitting procedures have been developed. Most of these however are computationally demanding or not general enough. To resolve this problem, two-step procedures of a specific type have been made, which fit a phase-type distribution (PH) to static parameters in the first step, and extend it to a MAP in the second while fitting dynamic parameters. Their general weakness is that the first step often restricts the attainable range of dynamic parameters. In our paper we present a method, that aims at providing a good starting point for the second step, by optimizing the representation of the PH that was produced by the first step.	aph technological consulting;l'année philologique;markov chain;two-phase locking	András Mészáros;Miklós Telek	2012	Proceedings Title: Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		mathematical optimization;operations management;mathematics;statistics	ML	7.820734590561947	-3.127392369054091	171918
6288027ce20cd6bcf00df94398cb7efb607b0fef	discrete event simulation of green supply chain with traffic congestion factor		Reduction of Carbon-Dioxide (CO2) emission has been a global challenge in strategic supply-chain decision making for many companies. This paper focuses on the transportation sector of the supply chain since it is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions. To reduce CO2 emissions, previous studies have focused on mathematical models, government policies that affect CO2 emission and optimizing results. This article will focus on the impact of traffic congestion on CO2 emission by means of simulating vehicle movement on the roads. A design of experiments was created in which thirty-two scenarios were tested using ARENA. The experiment focused on factors such as synchronization or desynchronization of traffic lights, mode of dispatch rates, and route configurations. Results revealed that the synchronization of traffic lights at each junction and the distribution of dispatched trucks would increase the amount of CO2 emissions significantly.	design of experiments;dynamic dispatch;experiment;mathematical model;network congestion;simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Ben Benzaman;Abdulla Al-Dhaheri;David Claudio	2016	2016 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		simulation;engineering;transport engineering;supply chain;air pollution	ML	9.199116371808204	-8.883969983311015	172033

In an attempt to reduce waste originating from ELVs, the Japanese Government introduced the ELV Recycling Law in 2002. Automobile shredder residue (ASR) recycling is essential to achieving the goals of the ELV Recycling Law and represents a major concern for the Japanese vehicle recycling industry. This paper proposes the tactical ASR recycling planning model, which can be used to assist Japanese vehicle recyclers to improve their profitability and ASR recycling efficiency. A numerical study is conducted in order to illustrate the potentials and applicability of the proposed modelling approach, and to gain insights into the performances of the Japanese vehicle recycling system and into the influence of the ELV Recycling Law. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate and validate the approach and its potentials. ELV Recycling Law influence is found to be crucial for the decision making on ASR recycling, as the 20% increase in valid recycling quota will cause approximately 50% decrease in the quantity of disposed ASR. We show that the stringent ASR recycling quota is easily attainable and present many interesting insights.		Vladimir Simic;Branka Dimitrijevic	2013	Expert Syst.

The present fuzzy heuristics approach is derivable from generalisation of conventional analytical optimisation method into fuzzy multitechnical tasks. In the present approach, first the goals and constraints of the end-user are identified. Then decision variables are expressed as functions of the design variables. Their desirable ranges and biases are defined using the same fuzzy satisfaction function form. The optimal result has highest total satisfaction. These are then checked and fine-tuned by finite element method FEM. The optimal solution is the ecoplastic vessel, and aluminium was close. The method reveals that optimum depends strongly on the preset goals and values of the producer, society, and end-user.		Heikki Ilmari Martikka;Erkki Taitokari	2011	Adv.

We present a method for reducing the system to an equivalent system with some subsystems replaced by a series structure. This reduction simplifies the computation of optimal ordering policies and can also allow for comparison of disruption impacts across systems with different supply chain structures. We identify conditions under which a state-dependent echelon base-stock policy is optimal. Based on this result, we propose a heuristic policy for solving the assembly system with disruptions and test its performance in numerical trials. Using additional numerical trials, we explore a variety of strategic questions. For example, contrary to what is typically observed in systems without disruptions, we find that choosing a supplier with a longer lead time can sometimes yield lower system costs. We also find that backup supply is more valuable for a supplier with a shorter lead time than one with a longer lead time. In addition, because of component complementarities, we find that choosing suppliers whose disruptions are perfectly correlated yields lower system costs than choosing suppliers whose disruptions are independent, in contrast to the strategy that is typically preferred when choosing backup suppliers for a single product.

The complexity of this multi-item inventory problem requires a fast and reliable method of determining the operating conditions that optimize the inventory control. Simulation techniques can be effectively used to determine an adequate ordering policy for this type of problems. Several ordering options were analyzed and compared to find the policy that best accomplishes the firm’s organizational objectives. The simulation model built allows the dynamic change in the demand pattern for each item of the inventory. The results revealed that the implementation of the multi-item replenishment policy can reduce total investment and maximize customer service, while maintaining the business efficiency.	inventory control;simulation	Carlos B.

Firstly, they usually assume that there is always an alternative sub-route during the whole driving process without considering whether there is a substitute or not when the traffic condition changes. Secondly, they confuse the optimal road with shortest road. The optimal road differs from the shortest road that always means the road with shortest time or shortest distance. Thirdly, they haven't taken full advantage of historical data. Most of time they only use historical data to compute average speed of each road. In this paper, we focus on these problems especially on how to choose a substitute route. We come up with a new idea to recommend routes by considering replaceable routes. It takes whether the road is replaceable or not into account to actually recommend reliable route and ease cities' traffic stress.	algorithm;computation;device driver;recommender system;u.s. route shield	Lei Yang;Yan Chu;Guangyu Li;Xingmei Wang;Linlin Xia;Zhengkui Wang;Kian-Lee Tan	2015	2015 Tenth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)	10.1109/ICDIM.2015.7381888	simulation;route planning software;computer security	DB	9.30164367988034	-8.010661057433323	174964

To balance capacity and demand, it is required to forecast the future demand based on optimistic and pessimistic projections to decide when and how much, the airport should expand the capacity. System dynamics simulation model can provide reliable forecast and generate scenarios to test alternative assumptions and decisions. It was found that GDP and FDI play an important role in fostering the demand. Terminal expansion would be required in 2018 based on the optimistic projection; meanwhile, based on pessimistic projection, the capacity can meet demand in 2030, which means no need to increase the capacity. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, the screening procedures using individual cut and linear cut approaches are proposed to solve the issue and to control default rates in credit assessment problems. Then, an economic screening model is provided to incorporate with the proposed approaches so that optimal cutoff points are determined by maximizing total profit. An example of a loan programme is illustrated the use of the proposed economic screening procedures. The results show that the linear cut approach uniformly outperforms the individual cut approach in terms of total profit and computation complexity. Moreover, the linear cut approach can be easily extended to the case with multiple variables and the solution is also in a closed form. Therefore, the screening procedure using the linear cut approach is strongly recommended for credit assessment problems.		H.-T. Tsai;Lyn C. Thomas;H.-C.

1034bab1785e93c0be0b9c52ac35764f325b3e10	robust strategic bidding in auction-based markets		Abstract In this paper, we propose an alternative methodology for devising revenue-maximizing strategic bids under uncertainty in the competitors’ bidding strategy. We focus on markets endowed with a sealed-bid uniform-price auction with multiple divisible products. On recognizing that the bids of competitors may deviate from equilibrium and are of difficult statistical characterization, we proposed a two-stage robust optimization model with equilibrium constraints aiming to devise risk-averse strategic bids. The proposed model is a trilevel optimization problem that can be recast as a particular instance of a bilevel program with equilibrium constraints. Reformulation procedures are proposed to find a single-level equivalent formulation suitable for column-and-constraint generation (CCG) algorithm. Results show that even for the case in which an imprecision of 1% is observed on the rivals’ bids in the equilibrium point, the robust solution provides a significant risk reduction (of 79.9%) in out-of-sample tests. They also indicate that the best strategy against high levels of uncertainty on competitors’ bid approaches to a price-taker offer, i.e., bid maximum capacity at marginal cost.

50f3f3bbbc98f43deb157ef8a4cbd9014bd36be5	a real options model for the disinvestment in conventional power plants		The liberalization of the energy market and the promotion of renewables lead to difficulties in the profitable operation even of many modern conventional power plants. Although such state-of-the-art plants are highly energy-efficient, they are often underutilized or even mothballed. Decisions about further operation or shut-down of these conventional power plants are in most cases characterized as being irreversible, implying uncertainty about future rewards, and being flexible in timing. A useful approach for evaluating (dis-)investment projects with uncertainties is the real options approach (ROA) [2, 14]. This valuation technique is based on option pricing methods used in finance that have been developed by Black, Scholes, and Merton [1, 11]. In the last two decades, real options models have been widely applied to analyze investment decisions under dynamic market conditions. In recent years, however, also the analysis of disinvestment decisions considering market uncertainties has gained in importance (e.g. in studies on the agricultural and dairy sector). Moreover, ignoring disinvestment options in decision-making processes can lead to incorrect valuations of investment strategies at the firm level. In this paper, we develop a real options model for the disinvestment in conventional power plants, with the aim of determining the optimal timing for the shut-down of unprofitable power plants.

The retailer, who faces a price-dependent stochastic demand, is a maximizer of the risk-adjusted expected profit, rather than of the expected profit. The paper first evaluates the implication of the various risk-preferences of the retailer on the manufacturer's policy under a full-information scenario. Then, it considers a partial information scenario and computes the expected value of perfect information. Finally, it assesses the impact on the manufacturer's profit of sharing the retailer's risk through the introduction of a buyback policy. Linear or iso-elastic demand functions and additive or multiplicative demand error structures capture the demand distributions. Analytical results as well as numerical examples illustrate the main features of the model.		F. J. Arcelus;S. Kumar;G.

These business objectives include profit and market share, as well as the more traditional management of risk. We formulate a mathematical model that addresses the problem of how acquisition decisions should be made with multiple, conflicting objectives when one, or more than one, scorecard is available to the portfolio manager. We show that iso-contours for expected profit, volume and loss are straight lines in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space and develop results that establish equivalence between ROC dominance, maximum expected profit, and efficient-frontier dominance in the space of multiple business measures. For two non-dominating scorecards, we derive the efficient frontiers in the profit-volume space and provide guidelines for choosing optimal policies based on the decision maker's trade-offs between objectives.	modern portfolio theory	P.

a841786a246db194086331bcd7ffa927f562c991	planning of agro-energy districts for optimum farm income and biomass energy from crops residues		The objectives of the European Union 2014–2020 programming period include increase of energy production from renewable sources through the creation of agro-energy districts. The utilization of residues of annual and perennial crops in agro-energy districts as a combustion product of the exploitation of biomass industry to produce heat and electricity, create a new sustainable environment. This paper focuses on optimizing the agricultural income and the biomass energy potential from crop residues in agricultural districts and especially in a case study in municipality of Almopia in Northern Greece. For this purpose, the optimal plan of agricultural production of the case study area arising from the development of a multi-criteria mathematical programming model that combines more than one conflicting criteria to a utility function that interprets the behavior of farmers and better approaches the rational decision making. The objective of the proposed model is to combine two criteria, namely the maximization of the total gross margin of the case study area and the maximization of electric or thermal power from biomass of crop residues, based on a set of constraints for land, labor, capital, Common Agricultural Policy rules, etc. The optimal production plan of the case study area achieves higher gross margin (3.6 %) and higher level of bioenergy (7.7 %) than the existent production plan. The optimal plan also presents better results than those achieved by the linear programming model when the only goal is to maximize either the gross margin or the production of bioenergy.

In reality, however, decision makers are often risk averse and markets are incomplete. We confirm that risk aversion lowers the probability of investment and demonstrate how this effect can be mitigated by incorporating operational flexibility in the form of embedded suspension and resumption options. Although such options facilitate investment, we find that the likelihood of investing is still lower compared to the risk-neutral case. Risk aversion also increases the likelihood that the project will be abandoned, although this effect is less pronounced. Finally, we illustrate the impact of risk aversion on the optimal suspension and resumption thresholds and the interaction among risk aversion, volatility, and optimal decision thresholds under complete operational flexibility. ∗Department of Statistical Science, University College ondon, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom †Department of Management Science & Innovation, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom ‡London Business School, Regent’s Park, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom §Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University/KTH, Stockholm, Sweden	embedded system;management science;risk aversion;systems science;volatility;windows embedded industry	Michail Chronopoulos;Bert De Reyck;Afzal Siddiqui	2011	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2011.03.007	inversion;financial economics;optimal decision;actuarial science;risk analysis;risk aversion;volatility;economics;risk management;decision analysis;investment;ambiguity aversion;market structure;economy;complete market;financial market	Metrics	3.851803942064174	-5.979515540964086	183273

Since the proposed model is formulated as an ill-defined problem due to uncertainty and is bi-objective, that is, to maximize both the abovementioned satisfaction levels, it is difficult to solve the model directly without introducing some criterion of optimality for the bi-objective functions. Therefore, by introducing fuzzy goals and an interactive fuzzy satisficing method, the proposed model is transformed into a deterministic equivalent problem. Furthermore, to obtain the exact optimal portfolio analytically, a solution method is developed by introducing the auxiliary problem and performing equivalent transformations. In order to compare the proposed model with previous useful models, numerical examples are provided, and the results show that it is important to maximize the robustness parameter and total return using the interactive process for adjusting investor's satisfaction levels.	robust optimization	Takashi Hasuike;Hideki Katagiri	2013	FO & DM	10.1007/s10700-013-9157-x	mathematical optimization;management science	Robotics	5.530104310154382	-5.797379665976094	183440

Industrial HEN design currently fails to effectively solve these problems. To resolve this problem, we present an online optimization and control approach method for an HEN with bypasses. The approach is based on the principles of sustainable energy conservation during the life cycle. The area margin of the heat exchanger is gradually released via bypass adjustment, thereby resulting in energy conservation. First, bypasses are set on the HEN to enhance HEN control and enable optimal manipulation of the equipment. Then, the total cumulative cost increment of the HEN, including the increment of utility costs and equipment investment costs, is regarded as the objective function. The effects of the heat transfer efficiency of the heat exchanger and the effects of bypass adjustment are also taken into account. We solve the optimal design margin of the HEN, thereby providing an operational space for optimal control. Finally, using the margin optimization design of the HEN with bypasses as basis, we treat the cumulative costs of the HEN in a certain cycle as the objective function to solve the optimal opening dynamically. While, we present an optimal control structure, which is combined with existing conventional control loops. The HEN of a given crude distillation unit in a refinery is chosen as the research object. And, results illustrate the effectiveness and application prospects of the proposed method.	mathematical optimization;online optimization	Xionglin Luo;Chekui Xia;Lin Sun	2013	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2013.02.002	design;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;process control;mechanical engineering	DB	9.993193303932456	-4.9226653957633095	183482

Using detailed data on container movements, gathered from two large international terminals, we simulate the impact of the two most important inspection policies that are being considered. We find that the current inspection regime being advanced by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security can only handle a small percentage of the total load. An alternate inspection protocol that emphasizes screening—a rapid primary scan of all containers, followed by a more careful secondary scan of only a few containers that fail the primary test—holds promise as a feasible solution for meeting the 100% scanning requirement.	network congestion;simulation;the 100	Nitin Bakshi;Stephen E.

An efficient method is proposed for determining optimal robust portfolios of risky financial instruments in the presence of ambiguity (uncertainty) on the probabilistic model of the returns. Specifically, it is assumed that a nominal discrete return distribution is given, while the true distribution is only known to lie within a distance d from the nominal one, where the distance is measured according to the Kullback–Leibler divergence. The goal in this setting is to compute portfolios that are worst-case optimal in the mean-risk sense, that is, to determine portfolios that minimize the maximum with respect to all the allowable distributions of a weighted risk-mean objective. The analysis in the paper considers both the standard variance measure of risk and the absolute deviation measure.	best, worst and average case;kullback–leibler divergence;risk assessment;robustness (computer science);statistical model	Giuseppe Carlo Calafiore	2007	SIAM Journal on Optimization	10.1137/060654803	mathematical optimization;robust optimization;actuarial science;deviation risk measure;asset allocation;mathematics;dynamic risk measure;distortion risk measure;time consistency	ML	5.0643630034444405	-5.113672345834219	184308
b04104fc2bb3c3888a048831ff1263d5f5ff0aa2	towards a prediction engine for flight delays based on weather delay analysis		Arrival performance for the United States shows that over 83 percent of flights are actually on time. However, 17 percent delayed flights are still an indisputable high number, having almost eight million commercial travel flights per year, only in the US. Knowledge of the conditions leading to flight delays may be used in a monitoring and prediction tool to diminish its impact on commercial flight operations. From a broader perspective, we also consider multi-modal logistics chains, which involve different modes of transportation. These modes are adopted in consecutive legs, which have to be thus synchronized. Determining whether a delay is going to be verified for the aircraft can thus be of advantage, in order to rearrange the overall transportation process involving such leg. This work reports on investigations carried out in the context of the GET (Green European Transport) Service1 project.

An unlimited reduction of this risk is not desirable since it would lead to an immense investment of resources. The Life Quality Index (LQI) acceptance criterion is a societal indicator that is used to judge the efficiency of safety measures to reduce the risk to life and can be used to optimise the investments into life saving measures. The risk is assessed by a probabilistic engineering approach that considers the fire development and the individual-based evacuation process as well as the associated uncertainties. Advanced uncertainty propagation methods are applied in order to face the difficulties by using computational expensive models and by using individual-based models. Sensitivity measures are applied to reveal the contribution of the uncertainties on the estimation of the risk. The approach is applied for a risk-based optimisation of the minimal required door width for retail buildings. & 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

High-tech industries such as information technology, semiconductors, optoelectronics, and aerospace industries are sensitive to PLM, especially in stage transition and timing control. PLM will directly affect the corporate performance, profit acquisition, and the achievement of business goals and ultimately affect the survival and development. In this study, we look at when to launch a new product to replace the old one, at the optimal time to maximize the overall profit, and the development of several quantitative models to provide the product life cycle sensitive industries. Based on the proposed models, two illustrative examples together with six tables of outcome under all possible parameters are applied to verify the feasibility of this study of practical applications.

First, the three-stage methodology, evaluation criteria and applicable tools are described. Especially, the process design and analysis is discussed as only limited amounts of process data is available for determining the optimal processing path and in the third stage the issue of implementation strategy is considered. As examples, two CO2 utilization methods for methanol production, combined reforming and direct synthesis are considered. Methanol plants employing such methods are developed using synthesis-design and simulation tools and their evaluation indicators are calculated under various implementation strategies. It is demonstrated that integrating or replacing an existing conventional methanol plant by a combined reforming method represents a sustainable solution. Additionally, producing methanol through direct hydrogenation is a promising way to convert CO2 when cheap H2 feeds are available.		Kosan Roh;Rebecca Frauzem;Tuan B. H. Nguyen;Rafiqul Gani;Jay H.

cabdf80f913a4a9f2cc9579eec7b2920121fa20b	a generalization of the orthogonal regression technique for life cycle inventory		"""Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method used to quantify the environmental impacts of a product, process, or service across its whole life cycle. One of the problems occurring when the system at hand involves processes delivering more than one valuable output is the apportionment of resource consumption and environmental burdens in the correct proportion amongst the products. The mathematical formulation of the problem is represented by the solution of an over-determined system of linear equations. The paper describes the application of an iterative algorithm for the implementation of least square regression to solve this over-determined system directly in its rectangular form. The applied algorithm dynamically passes from an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) problem to the regression problems known as Total Least Squares (TLS) and Data Least Squares (DLS). The obtained results suggest further investigations. In particular, the so called constrained least squares method is identified as an interesting development of the methodology. EC (EC, 2008), which obliges the member states to take an integrated approach to the protection of the environment in licensing environmentally relevant installations, taking into account all environmental media (air, water, land). Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology used to quantify the environmental burdens (i.e., emissions of pollutants into the environment or depletion of natural resources) and impacts (i.e., actual quantitative measure DOI: 10.4018/jaeis.2012010105 52 International Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Information Systems, 3(1), 51-71, January-June 2012 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

Its main advantage over other site-specific methods for environmental analysis, such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or Environmental Audit (EA), is that it broadens the system boundaries to include all burdens and impacts in the life cycle of a product or a process, rather than focusing on emissions and wastes generated by the plant or manufacturing site only. In this way LCA, if correctly used, allows to avoid shifts of environmental burdens from a life cycle stage to another. LCA has developed rapidly since 1990s, at the same time gaining widespread acceptance for various applications ranging from policy development, decision making, strategic planning and design. Progress in LCA has been marked by some degree of standardization in the form of the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards. As showed in Figure 1, LCA is traditionally divided into four distinct though interdependent phases: 1. Goal and scope definition. Attempts to set the extent of the inquiry as well as specify the methods used to conduct it in later phases. 2. Life cycle inventory analysis (LCI). Defines and quantifies the flow of material and energy into, through, and from a product system. 3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Converts inventory data into environmental impacts using a two-step process of classification and characterization. 4. Life cycle interpretation. Marks the point in an LCA when one draws conclusions and formulates recommendations based upon inventory and impact assessment data. Even though defining the general framework for LCA, the ISO regulations do not provide detailed methodological guidance. Comprehensive and detailed guidelines are supplied, e.g., by Consoli et al.

Prior research has often modeled only one aspect of the issue, such as proposing internal pricing scheme for capacity allocation ignoring demand uncertainty and the influence of the manager, optimizing capacity alone ignoring the agency issue, or incentive contract design ignoring capacity limit and service delay. We show that simply employing a traditional incentive contract (which often ignores service delays) for the manager responsible for promoting a center's services will provide incorrect incentives and lead to a more congested and less profitable system. When firms focus on optimizing operational capacity alone, ignoring the impact of managers on service demand, they are able to maintain the optimal utilization and service quality by balancing capacity and delay costs. However, they forgo profit-increasing opportunities, as they ignore the impact of the optimal incentive contract and do not motivate the managers enough to boost demand. To tackle the management challenges faced by modern service centers, we take an integrated capacity-contracting approach by incorporating operational delays and capacity decisions within the incentive contract design. Embedding a queuing model in a general incentive contracting framework, we present a novel approach to deriving the optimal compensation contract and operational capacity for a service center. We illustrate in numerical examples that a Pareto improvement can be achieved with our integrated contracting approach because every party, from the firm to the manager, to customers, to equipment and software vendors, benefits.

We call this the persistency problem for a discrete optimization problem under uncertain objective, and the marginal probability mass function of the optimal solution is named the persistence value. In general, this is a difficult problem to solve, even if the distribution of the objective coefficient is well specified. In this paper, we solve a subclass of this problem when the distribution is assumed to belong to the class of distributions defined by given marginal distributions, or given marginal moment conditions. Under this model, we show that the persistency problem maximizing the expected objective value over the set of distributions can be solved via a concave maximization model. The persistency model solved using this formulation can be used to obtain important qualitative insights to the behavior of stochastic discrete optimization problems. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to obtain insights to problems in discrete choice modeling. Using a set of survey data from a transport choice modeling study, we calibrate the random utility model with choice probabilities obtained from the persistency model. Numerical results suggest that our persistency model is capable of obtaining estimates that perform as well, if not better, than classical methods, such as logit and cross-nested logit models. We can also use the persistency model to obtain choice probability estimates for more complex choice problems. We illustrate this on a stochastic knapsack problem, which is essentially a discrete choice problem under budget constraint.	choice modelling;coefficient;concave function;consistency model;discrete choice;discrete optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;knapsack problem;marginal model;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;persistence (computer science);randomness	Karthik Natarajan;Miao Song;Chung-Piaw Teo	2009	Management Science	10.1287/mnsc.1080.0951	discrete optimization;econometrics;mathematical optimization;mixed logit;integer programming;discrete choice;mathematics;logistic regression;mathematical economics;statistics	ML	4.230136044442811	-3.6782144965169135	186436

Although AM and SM offer several unique advantages, there are technological limitations such as tolerance and surface finish requirements; tooling and fixturing, etc. that cannot be met by a single type of manufacturing. The intent of this article is not to show a new manufacturing method, but rather to provide economic context to additive and subtractive methods as the best practice provides, and look at the corresponding economics of each of those methods as a function of production batch size, machinability, cost of the material, part geometry and tolerance requirements. Basic models of fixed and variable costs associated with additive, subtractive and hybrid methods to produce parts are also presented. An experimental design is used to study the influence of production volume, material and operating cost, batch size, machinability of the material and impact of reducing AM processing time. A composite response model for the unit cost is computed for the various levels associated with such engineering requirements. The developed models provide insight into how these variables affect the costs associated with engineering a mechanical product that will be produced using AM and SM methods. From the results, it appears that batch size, AM processing time and AM processing cost were the major cost factors. It was shown that the cost of producing ‘near-net’ shape through SM and AM was the decision criteria; which will be critical for tough-to-machine alloys and at multi-batch size.	3d printing;additive model;integrated computer-aided manufacturing	Guha Manogharan;Richard A.

For the resulting inventory control problem at the supplier, optimal policies and structural properties were presented by Gavirneni et al. (Management Sci. 45(1) (1999) 16). They detailed an e cient solution procedure for the uncapacitated problem and resorted to computationally expensive in3nitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) for the capacitated situation. In this paper, we study a heuristic, based on the uncapacitated solution, for the capacitated situation. A detailed computational study showed that this heuristic is very e cient in that the costs increased by only 3.3% on the average. The heuristic was especially e8ective at higher capacities, lower holding costs, and extreme values of demand variance. c © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The random occurrence of interruptions at the source where downtime is also stochastic can result in stockouts at the two receiving locations. Our model studies the benefit of allowing each location to carry a safety stock where holding costs can be different at each location. The objective is to reduce overall cost at both locations. In some cases it is optimal to allow for a transshipment of inventory from the safety stock of one location to the other. We jointly solve for the optimal safety stock at each location and the optimal amount to be transshipped from a location to the other. We show that by conditioning on the transshipment direction the total cost becomes convex as a function of the safety stock levels at the receiving locations and the amount to be transshipped from a location to the other. Numerical examples are presented for different system cost parameters and probability distributions.	convex function;convolution;decision theory;environment variable;heart rate variability;interrupt;numerical analysis;numerical integration;optimization problem;production system (computer science);radio frequency;randomness;safety stock;uninterruptible power supply	Walid W.

The research attempts to ascertain the importance of different sectors of Indian stock market. Prediction also forms the basis for safe investment as mar- ket risk is diversified into number of available sectors. We propose a methodol- ogy in which our major concern is bit micro level. Instead of giving whole fo- cus to Stock market, we had considered on the working of individual sectors of stock market. A model is proposed in which key factors are supplied as input in the lower layer, the middle layer comprises of one or more tools such as Neural network, Genetic Algorithms etc, which will provide output and thus an intelli- gent and smart decision can be achieved by studying and analyzing the output.

Modelling and simulation modelling is an accepted approach for advancing this shortcoming. Due to uncertainty and complexity of supply chains that stem from its nature perhaps system dynamics provides a better insight compared to the other simulation models for studying the concept. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an insight that why and whether system dynamics has application in integration of supply chain management.	downstream (software development);mathematical model;molecular modelling;simulation;system dynamics;upstream (software development)	Tillal Eldabi;Amir Keramati	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24175-8_3	supply chain risk management	AI	5.779066001099272	-6.888914581547992	187854

The framework may also be used to extract probabilities of default (PD) functions from market data. Our approach is entirely based on observables such as equity prices and interest rates, rather than on unobservable processes such as firm value. The model stitches together in an arbitrage-free setting a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) equity model (to represent the behavior of equity prices prior to default), a default intensity process, and a Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model for the evolution of riskless interest rates. The model captures several stylized features such as a negative relation between equity prices and equity volatility, a negative relation between default intensity and equity prices, and a positive relationship between default intensity and equity volatility. We embed the model on a discrete-time, recombining lattice, making implementation feasible with polynomial complexity. We demonstrate the simplicity of calibrating the model to market data and of using it to extract default information. The framework is extensible to handling correlated default risk and may be used to value distressed convertible bonds, debt-equity swaps, and credit portfolio products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Applied to the CDX INDU (credit default index–industrials) Index, we find the S&P 500 index explains credit premia.	cdx format;constant elasticity of variance model;default logic;elasticity (data store);observable;polynomial;technical debt;time complexity;volatility	Sanjiv R.

be2b3e8cad24729ecfebeba6fb2f1975dca3cc57	a systematic approach to the optimal design of chemical plants with waste reduction and market uncertainty		The paper presents a methodology for the quantitative assessment of sustainability applied to the design of chemical plants. Specifically, we focus on the economic and environmental sustainability. The methodology implemented for the economic assessment is the predictive conceptual design (PCD) that uses as indicator the cumulated dynamic economic potential over a long-term horizon. PCD accounts for both CAPEX and OPEX terms, which on their turn depend on dynamic econometric models of commodities and utilities. The environmental assessment is based on the waste reduction algorithm and on the evaluation of the potential environmental impact. The benefit of PCD consists in accounting for market uncertainty and prices/costs volatility of OPEX terms. The optimal solutions of the economic and environmental assessment lay on the Pareto line produced by the multi-objective-optimization (MOO) problem. The MOO of a cumene plant allows discussing various optimal solutions in terms of economic and environmental concerns/criteria.	algorithm;econometric model;mathematical optimization;optimal design;pareto efficiency;process-centered design;volatility	Piernico Sepiacci;Valentina Depetri;Davide Manca	2017	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2016.11.032	mathematical optimization;simulation;environmental engineering;engineering	AI	9.662964115823973	-4.810017708825571	189397

Accordingly, how to price the software becomes an important problem and is still unsolved with satisfactions. Using the Principle-Agent method in economics, the pricing model for web search engines based on the theory of Brown Motion with drifts is established. The stopping time is defined for the model, and the expected benefit of the web-search-engine provider over the rental horizon is derived, with a special case for the outright sale. By maximizing the benefit, the optimal price for the outright sale, the optimal monthly rental and the optimal selling price after renting the search engine for a period of time are discussed. Finally, given sets of parameters, simulations are implemented, and the results show that the optimal prices are reasonable.	learning to rank;web search engine	Xun Liang;Yang Bo He	2005		10.1007/11600930_67	pricing;stochastic process;the internet;systems modeling;economics;web search engine;stopping time;computer science;artificial intelligence;economic model;mathematics;location;computer security;search engine;statistics	Web+IR	4.053583762133009	-3.2214830699761166	189963

If it is not properly managed WEEE can cause major environmental problems and huge waste of material resources. In this paper, a systematic end-of-life (EoL) management approach has been developed to handle WEEE with the environment and economic considerations. The developed approach is capable to find out the optimal selective disassembly sequence and the best EoL Type options for each component with a maximum profit and meet the requirements of the WEEE and Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directives. It also can help designers make optimal decisions while designing a product considering EoL recycling rate and profit. An industrial case study on Liquid Crystal Display Televisions (LCD-TVs) of the type LC24F4 is performed to validate the developed approach.	directive (programming);disassembler;electronic waste;end-of-life (product);fastest;industrial robot;liquid-crystal display;requirement;sensor;television	Guoqing Jin;Weidong Li;Sheng Wang;D.

5371eb2357ce6c9379a5eefcff7d96e58b90a0c3	large-scale estimation of parking requirements for autonomous mobility on demand systems		Cities everywhere are anticipating new mobility technologies to help solve issues with congestion and pollution while providing afforable, accessible, reliable and convenient transportation for growing populations. The adoption of self-driving vehicles is projected to happen soon and help with achieving these goals, especially if part of a shared mobility on demand service. Potential benefits of such a system include a reduction of the number of vehicles and freeing up parking spaces, while challenges still include managing the traffic volume. Previous research focused on estimating fleet size in different scenarios. In this work, we focus on estimating minimum fleet size, parking needs and total travel distance for an autonomous mobility on demand solution serving all trips made in private vehicles in Singapore, generated from a comprehensive simulation of the city’s mobility. We specifically focus on parking demand as currently a significant amount of space has to be designated as parking in cities, which is poised to become obsolate if people switch from private vehicles to shared ones which are utilized much more efficiently. We show that over 85% reduction in the number of vehicles and parking spaces can be achieved while serving all trips made currently in private vehicles. We further show that potential increased traffic volume can be mitigated with the incorporation of ride-sharing, while offering even higher savings, up to 92% in both fleet size and parking needs.	autonomous robot;network congestion;population;requirement;simulation	Dániel Kondor;Paolo Santi;Kakali Basak;Xiaohu Zhang;Carlo Ratti	2018	CoRR		artificial intelligence;trips architecture;machine learning;traffic volume;transport engineering;mathematics	HCI	9.618736595641382	-8.196000155254854	191092
1c0b34ad378a863b0678272eeb58f55082c67da8	development of optimization-based probabilistic earthquake scenarios for the city of tehran	earthquake scenarios;tehran;optimization;seismic hazard;monte carlo	This paper presents the methodology and practical example for the application of optimization process to select earthquake scenarios which best represent probabilistic earthquake hazard in a given region. The method is based on simulation of a large dataset of potential earthquakes, representing the long-term seismotectonic characteristics in a given region. The simulation process uses Monte-Carlo simulation and regional seismogenic source parameters to generate a synthetic earthquake catalogue consisting of a large number of earthquakes, each characterized with magnitude, location, focal depth and fault characteristics. Such catalogue provides full distributions of events in time, space and size; however, demands large computation power when is used for risk assessment, particularly when other sources of uncertainties are involved in the process. To reduce the number of selected earthquake scenarios, a mixed-integer?linear?program?formulation is developed in this study. This approach results in reduced set of optimization-based probabilistic earthquake scenario, while maintaining shape of hazard curves and full probabilistic picture by minimizing the error between hazard curves driven by full and reduced sets of synthetic earthquake scenarios. To test the model, the regional seismotectonic and seismogenic characteristics of northern Iran are used to simulate a set of 10,000-year worth of events consisting of some 84,000 earthquakes. The optimization model is then performed multiple times with various input data, taking into account probabilistic seismic hazard for Tehran city as the main constrains. The sensitivity of the selected scenarios to the user-specified site/return period error-weight is also assessed. The methodology could enhance run time process for full probabilistic earthquake studies like seismic hazard and risk assessment. The reduced set is the representative of the contributions of all possible earthquakes; however, it requires far less computation power. The authors have used this approach for risk assessment towards identification of effectiveness-profitability of risk mitigation measures, using optimization model for resource allocation. Based on the error-computation trade-off, 62-earthquake scenarios are chosen to be used for this purpose.	mathematical optimization	Mohammad R. Zolfaghari;E.

We propose the use of a multi-objective optimization model to maximize total hydropower production, while limiting negative impacts on river connectivity. Critically, we consider the so called backwater e ects that dams have on power generation at nearby upstream sites via changes in water surface pro les. We further account for the likelihood that migratory sh and other aquatic species can successfully pass hydropower dams and other arti cial/natural barriers and how this is in uenced by backwater e ects. Although naturally represented in nonlinear form, we manage through a series of linearization steps to formulate a mixed integer linear programing model. We illustrate the utility of our proposed framework using a case study from England and Wales. Interestingly, we show that for England and Wales, a region heavily impacted by a large number of existing river barriers, that installation of small hydropower dams tted with even moderately e ective sh passes can, in fact, create a win-win situation that results in increased hydropower and improved river connectivity.	aquatic ecosystem;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nonlinear system	Christina Ioannidou;Jesse R.

Selected methods for analysis of results obtained by solving stochastic programs are presented and their scope illustrated on generic examples ± the Markowitz model, a multiperiod bond portfolio management problem and a general strategic investment problem. The approaches are based on asymptotic and robust statistics, on the moment problem and on results of parametric optimization. Key words: Portfolio optimization, stochastic programming, stability, postoptimality, worst-case analysis 1 Some early contributions The main feature of the investment and ®nancial problems is the necessity to make decisions under uncertainty and over more than one time period. The uncertainties concern the future level of interest rates, yields of stock, exchange rates, prepayments, external cash ̄ows, in ̄ation, future demand, liabilities, etc. There exist various stochastic models describing or explaining these parameters and they represent an important part of various procedures used to generate the input for decision models. To build a decision model, one has to decide ®rst about the purpose or goal; this includes identi®cation of the uncertainties or risks one wants to hedge, of the hard and soft constraints, of the time horizon and its discretization, etc. The next step is the formulation of the model and generation of the data input. An algorithmic solution concludes the ®rst part of the procedure. The subsequent interpretation and evaluation of the results may lead to model changes and, consequently, to a new solution or it may require a ``what-if '' analysis to get information about robustness of the results. Example 1 ± The Markowitz model. In conclusions of his famous paper [49] on portfolio selection, Markowitz stated that ``what is needed is essentially a `probabilistic' reformulation of security analysis''. He developed a model for portfolio optimization in an uncertain environment under various simpli®cations. It is a static, single period model which assumes a frictionless market. It applies to small rational investors whose investments cannot in ̄uence the market prices and who prefer higher yields to lower ones and smaller risks to larger ones. Let us recall the basic formulation: The composition of portfolio of I assets is given by weights of the considered assets, xi, i  1; . . . ; I , P i xi  1. The unit investment in the i-th asset provides the random return ri over the considered ®xed period. The assumed probability distribution of the vector r of returns of all assets is characterized by a known vector of expected returns Er  r and by a covariance matrix V  covri; rj; i; j  1; . . . ; I  whose main diagonal consists of variances of individual returns. This allows to quantify the ``yield from the investment'' as the expectation rx Pi xiri  r>x of its total return and the ``risk of the investment'' as the variance of its total return, s2x Pi; j covri; rjxixj  x>Vx. According to the assumptions, the investors aim at maximal possible yields and, at the same time, at minimal possible risks ± hence, a typical decision problem with two criteria, ``max'' frx;ÿs2xg. The mean-variance e1⁄2ciency introduced by Markowitz is fully in line with general concepts of multicriteria optimization. Hence, mean-variance e1⁄2cient portfolios can be obtained by solving various optimization problems, e.g., max x AX flr>xÿ 1=2x>Vxg 1 where the value of parameter lV 0 re ̄ects investor's risk aversion. In classical theory, the set X is de®ned by P i xi  1 without nonnegativity constraints, which means that short sales are permitted. It was the introduction of risk into the investment decisions which was the exceptional feature of this model and a real breakthrough. The Markowitz model became a standard tool for portfolio optimization. It has been applied not only to portfolios of shares, but also to bonds [57], to international loans [68], etc., even to asset and liability management with portfolio returns replaced by the surplus, cf. [51]. However, there are many questions to be answered: Modeling the random returns to get their expectations, variances and covariances and analysis of sensitivity of the investment strategy on these estimated input values, the choice of the value of l, etc. From the point of view of optimization, an inclusion of linear regulatory constraints does not cause any serious problems. This, however does not apply to minimal transaction unit constraints which introduce 0±1 variables; e.g., [71]. In the interpretation and application of the results one has to be aware of the model assumptions (not necessarily ful®lled in real-life), namely, that it is a oneperiod model based on the buy-and-hold strategy applied between the initial investment and the horizon of the problem so that decisions based on its repeated use over more that one period can be far from a good, suboptimal dynamic decision, cf. [9]. At the same time, Roy [67] proposed to use the Safety-First criterion max x AX Pr>xV rp 2 246 J.

Each firm’s revenues and costs are proportional with its expected sales volume, with a cost rate which depends on the firm’s chosen attraction value according to an arbitrary increasing function. While most existing competition papers with attraction models can be viewed as special cases of this general model, we apply our general results to a new set of quality competition models. Here an industry with N suppliers of a given product, compete for the business of one or more buyers. Each of the suppliers encounters an uncertain yield factor, with a given, general yield distribution. The buyers face uncertain demands over the course of a given sales season. The suppliers compete by selecting key characteristics of their yield distributions, either their means, their standard deviations or both. These choices have implications for their per unit cost rates.	aggregate data;concave function;consistency model;decade (log scale);nash equilibrium;point process;supermodular function;yang	Awi Federgruen;Nan Yang	2009	Management Science	10.1287/mnsc.1090.1073	game theory;economics;stochastic modelling;marketing;operations management;mathematics;economy;management;statistics	DB	3.6407446037256674	-3.6184857676435676	192874

All rights reserved. A DSS used for vehicle routing at the Westland Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd., New Zealand, is providing a spectrum of benefits and business values. Labor hours, required by the schedulers, have been significantly reduced; the schedules they develop are more efficient, the number of truck drivers has been reduced even though the volume of the traffic is increasing, and the Transport Office has a greater flexibility and higher morale. The system includes powerful tools to plan schedules, choose plans, generate alternative plans, and assess alternative plans with respect to the given criteria. The system also allows the scheduler to create routes automatically, minimize the total distance traveled, and manually modify routes created by a model. It also has several classic characteristics that are too seldom actually realized: it leverages the judgment of the DSS user; it has evolved over time through an iterative development process and is being adapted for use in another company. Taken together, these benefits and attributes make the system a rare example of a successful DSS that can provide guidance for the development of other systems in the important problem domain of vehicle routing.

In this paper, prospects for long-term redistribution of freight flows are explored using origin–destination (OD) flow data from the 1993 US Commodity Flow Survey and a minimum-error technique for estimating disaggregate commodity flows. A prototype analysis of the pulp and paper sector was carried out. The analysis found that matching demand for paper products with geographically optimal production centers and producing an optimal mix of outputs in each center could lead to substantial reductions in total ton-miles (on the order of 17–38%) compared to the 1993 base case. A conceptual example of the implementation of the methodology and an analysis of potential energy savings from spatial redistribution are also presented.	mathematical optimization	Francis M.

15f951ebb7b7b78268ae49659848003056f62124	the behavioural aspect of green technology investments: a general positive model in the context of heterogeneous agents		Studies report that firms do not invest in cost-effective green technologies. While economic barriers can explain parts of the gap, behavioural aspects cause further under-valuation. This could be partly due to systematic deviations of decision-making agents’ perceptions from normative benchmarks, and partly due to their diversity. This paper combines available behavioural knowledge into a simple model of technology adoption. Firms are modelled as heterogeneous agents with different behavioural responses. To quantify the gap, the model simulates their investment decisions from different theoretical perspectives. While relevant parameters are uncertain at the micro-level, using distributed agent perspectives provides a realistic representation of the macro adoption rate. The model is calibrated using audit data for proposed investments in energy efficient electric motors. The inclusion of behavioural factors reduces significantly expected adoption rates: from 81% using a normative optimisation perspective, down to 20% using a behavioural perspective. The effectiveness of various policies is tested. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

b84e26bfc4eadcff2a2d75556938c158df0e5b2e	comparison of feedback linearization and model predictive techniques for variable speed limit control		Ahstract- Different types of variable speed limit (VSL) controllers have been proposed to improve the traffic mobility at highway bottlenecks. However, the benefit of VSL is sometimes deteriorated by the capacity drop phenomenon introduced by the disordered lane changes at the vicinity of the bottleneck. Our recent results show that by combining the VSL controller with lane change control, the capacity drop can be significantly relieved or avoided at the bottleneck. In this paper, we propose feedback linearization and model predictive control schemes for VSL-actuated highway traffic, where a lane change controller is assumed to be active upstream of the bottleneck. Via simulation studies, we compare the performance and robustness of the proposed controllers with respect to perturbations on traffic demand, model parameters and measurement noise. Results show that both controllers are able to improve the total time spent under different levels of perturbation and noise. Furthermore, feedback linearization VSL can provide better performance than model predictive VSL with negligible computational effort and similar robustness.

The efficiency of the long-sighted and myopic inventory control policies is compared. Different approaches to design the optimal stationary policies are investigated. A comparative evaluation of these approaches is given and the specifics of their application are discussed.

This paper presents a rigorous model that accounts for such system dynamics in disassembly process planning (DPP), a critical stage to the efficiency of product/material recovery. In particular, this model with the learning capability will be able to: (1) mathematically represent the operational planning of disassembly in the light of uncertainty (i.e., the quality of reclaimed products and the impact of human intervention); (2) accumulate and exploit """"knowledge"""" of system performance via the observation of the process behavior; and (3) dynamically derive a cost-effective disassembly plan."""	digital photo professional (dpp);disassembler;petri net;system dynamics	Ying Tang;Mengchu Zhou	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384362	simulation;computer science;computer performance;process architecture;petri net	Robotics	7.1565000561564105	-6.605869910513411	194609

An arrival incurs a cost, while a departure earns a revenue. The objective is to maximize the profit by controlling the intensities subject to capacity limits and holding costs. When the stochastic model for arrival and departure processes are completely known, then a threshold policy is known to be optimal. Many times arrival and departure processes can not be accurately modeled and controlled due to lack of sufficient calibration data or inaccurate assumptions. We prove that a threshold policy is optimal under a max–min robust model when the uncertainty in the processes is characterized by relative entropy. Our model generalizes the standard notion of relative entropy to account for different levels of model uncertainty in arrival and departure processes. We also study the impact of uncertainty levels on the optimal threshold control.		A. Jain;Andrew E. B. Lim;J.

The amount of waste the network is projected to handle in 2015 will increase from about 340,000 tonnes/year in 2006 up to about 1.5 million tonnes/year, following population and consumption raise. The paper proposes a discrete-event model to represent Clyde Transfer Station (TS) and its relations with the other terminals. Such a model allows one to evaluate the effects of different expansion plans of the station structures as well as different policies of the collection service. The results show that, as often happens, a careful consideration of management alternatives can decrease the necessity of structural enlargement, which is normally much more expensive, if at all possible. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result of globalization in the past two decades, supply chains are encountering more unknown conditions and risks. One important category of risks is disruptions that block material flowing through a supply chain and that may even result in end-product manufacturing failure. This paper uses a Petri nets-based model as a tool to understand the dissemination of disruptions and to trace the operational performance of a supply chain. The presented approach models how changes propagate through a supply chain and calculates the impact of disruptions on supply chain attributes by concluding the states that are obtainable from a given initial status in the supply chain. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

244957d498936f1f02958dc67b49ecf1197e5993	preliminary analysis of warehouse localization systems based on rfid technology		In the industrial warehouse design domain, today’s computerized information systems have gained a relevant interest due to the issues related to asset tracking and traceability. In such context, the employment of new information technologies on warehouse management systems has opened new business opportunities due to the sensible price reduction in the last years. This paper focuses on the technical issues related to the realization of wireless localization systems for warehouses, which are necessary for the implementation of random allocation policies, and in particular investigates the opportunities offered by RFID technology in such context. The enforcement of random allocation policies allows to increase the utilization coefficient of warehouses which is a critical issue, for example in refrigerated warehouses for perishable products. In particular, the development of localization systems based on trilateration is here considered, and an experimental model which links the received signal strength to the reading distance has been determined in order to take into account the specific features of the technology employed. A methodology is hence proposed to overcome the simplifying assumptions theoretical attenuation models rely on, by fitting a mathematical model on experimental observations. The problem of the accuracy level required to locate Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) of fixed dimensions is also considered, resulting in the evaluation of the maximum allowed reading distance. On the basis of the obtained results, the optimal configuration of the fixed infrastructure in terms of the number of antennas and their position is finally defined.	coefficient;information system;mathematical model;radio-frequency identification;traceability;warehouse management system	Giada La Scalia;Giuseppe Aiello;Mario Enea;Rosa Micale	2010	I.

If road ha uliers choose to load their truck on a train, they are not able to switch to using the road again until they reach the end of the line. On the contrary, highway choice is flexi ble in that the road haulier can change road at any time. Building upon the irreversibility of one of the two choices, we build a model where traffic levels are risky using both infrastructures. In the model, we find that h uliers’ choices depend upon the infrastructure pri ce for railways and on the information level obtained by t he haulier during travel. The flexible option is m ore valuable the more informed the agent is about traffic levels . These theoretical predictions are tested by implem enting two experimental treatments. In the first, agents gain no information during their travel; in the second they become perfectly informed about tra ffic conditions during the travel. Importantly, experim ental payoffs are calibrated upon transport data ab out time and operating costs and infrastructure tariffs in Franc e. From the experiment, we find that more risk ave rse agents assign more value to the flexible option. The seco nd result is that subjects overreact to infrastruct ure price changes. We observe that, except at very low price lev ls, subjects tend to choose the flexible optio n more frequently, even when it is suboptimal. ♣ We thank two anonymous referees for their valuable remarks and suggestions. All errors remain our own . 2 The results are the following: as the model stands, price levels and information level are important e xplanatory variables of choice. The higher the price is for ra ilw ys and the higher the information is, the more subjects give value to flexible option (highway), especially if s ubjects are risk averse. The second result is that subjects overreact to inf rastructure price modification. We observe that, ex cept for low levels of price, subjects tend to choose the flexib l option more frequently, even if it is suboptimal .

Although disassembly in practice is manual and labor intensive, little attention has been paid to the human intervention in the disassembly process. This paper addresses this deficiency by developing a fuzzy attributed Petri net (FAPN) model to mathematically represent uncertainty in disassembly due to a large amount of human intervention. An algorithm based upon this model is further proposed for optimal disassembly planning with a view to making the technique more applicable to real industry settings. The benefit of the proposed model and algorithm is illustrated through the disassembly of a personal computer (PC) in a prototypical disassembly system	algorithm;angular defect;assembly language;disassembler;human factors and ergonomics;human interface device;personal computer;petri net;refinement (computing)	Ying Tang;Mengchu Zhou	2004	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans	10.1109/ICSMC.2004.1401189		Robotics	7.13052943032899	-6.612179755047532	197671
