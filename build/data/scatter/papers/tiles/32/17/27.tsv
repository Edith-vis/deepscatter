However, most broadcast schemes used the standard 802.11 CSMA/CA technique to avoid forwarding storm which will cause the delay from waiting timeout. This paper develops an efficient protocol in which the selected node will broadcast the emergency message immediately without the waiting time by looking for a partner for every source. Before broadcasting a message, the source selects a neighbor as its partner and adds the selected neighbor's identifier to the emergency message to tell its neighbors. Upon receiving of a broadcasting message, the partner will rebroadcast the message immediately. Specifically, we choose the partner by cross-layer optimizations and exploit cooperative forwarding mechanism to help the forwarding when the partner fail to transmit the message to increase reliability and real-time. With the realistic simulation studies, the protocol demonstrates better performance than previous contention-based schemes by reducing end-to-end delay and keeping high message reception rate.	algorithm;broadcast radiation;cooperative mimo;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);identifier;network packet;real-time clock;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;vehicle-to-vehicle	Aihuang Guo;Fan Fei;Xiulan Shen;Yusheng Ji	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China (ChinaCom)	10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7498061	vehicular ad hoc network;broadcasting;telecommunications;computer science;message broker;computer security;computer network	Visualization	5.846849247475124	87.99404369836198	148407

Research is evolving from applications where performance is not considered as a crucial factor, to applications where performance is a critical factor. There are many cases in the fields of automation, health monitoring, and disaster response that demand wireless sensor networks where performance assurances are vital especially for parameters like power, delay and reliability. Due to the nature of these networks the higher amount of traffic is observed when the monitored event is taking place. Exactly at this instance, there is a higher probability of congestion appearance in the network. Congestion in WSNs is tackled by the employment of two methods; either by reducing the load (“traffic control”), or by increasing resources (“resource control”). In this paper we present the Hierarchical Tree Alternative Path (HTAP) algorithm, a “resource control” algorithm that attempts through simple steps and minor computations to mitigate congestion in wireless sensor networks by creating dynamic alternative paths to the sink. HTAP is evaluated in several scenarios in comparison with a state of the art “resource control” algorithm (TARA), as well as with a “traffic control” algorithm (SenTCP) and the case where no congestion control applies in the network (“no CC”). Results prove that HTAP is a simple and efficient algorithm capable of dealing successfully with congestion in WSNs, while preserving the performance characteristics of the network.	algorithm;computation;control theory;deadlock;hop-by-hop transport;minimum spanning tree;network congestion;network packet;performance evaluation;topology control;tree structure	Charalambos Sergiou;Vasos Vassiliou;Aristodemos Paphitis	2013	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2012.05.010	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;efficient energy use;network congestion;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.7921188352991715	83.33483686977345	148512

Some efficient flooding methods cut down the overhead by minimizing the set of nodes participating in packet relays. When used for route discovery, however, these approaches may suppress the detection of optimal routes. A region-based routing (REGR) protocol was proposed in to effectively reduce route discovery overhead without sacrificing route optimality. REGR defines a pre-routing region and tries to find a high-quality route by broadcasting a route request message only within the region. Although the region-limited broadcasting reduces overhead, it is actually not efficient, and may experience frequent packet collision especially in dense networks. In this paper, we propose a progressive route calculation (PROQ) protocol to locate the optimal route around a preliminary route obtained from sketchy network scanning. We propose to use progressive Dijkstra's algorithm to make nodes on the preliminary route jointly derive a minimum cost spanning tree (MCST) between a source-destination pair. The topology information needed to derive the MCST is delivered along the preliminary route by using unicast packets, which makes the new protocol more efficient and reliable than broadcast approaches. We simulate PROC and compare it with various protocols. The simulation results verify the efficiency of our method.	collision domain;dijkstra's algorithm;file spanning;mesh networking;minimum spanning tree;network packet;overhead (computing);relay;routing;simulation;unicast;wireless mesh network	Xuhui Hu;Myung J.

However, this scheme introduces huge end-to-end latency and still suffers from a large control packet overhead. We propose a new MAC protocol with low latency and low control overhead for WSNs use (the LCO-MAC). In our protocol, a DATA packet can be transmitted through multiple hops in a single duty cycle to shorten end-to-end latency. To reduce energy consumption caused by control packet overhead, we force one packet to play more than one role. In the initial transmission period, a control packet acts as an RTS (request to send) for a downstream node and a CTS (clear to send) for an upstream node. In the actual data transmission period, a DATA packet keeps its original DATA role for the downstream node, but also plays an ACK (acknowledgment) role for the upstream node. Our simulation using ns-2 has shown that LCO-MAC enables a notable improvement in energy efficiency and decreases end-to-end latency compared to those of RMAC.	access control;acknowledgement (data networks);acknowledgment index;carpal tunnel syndrome;downstream (software development);duty cycle;end-to-end principle;network packet;overhead (computing);rs-232;simulation	Kien Nguyen;Yusheng Ji	2008	2008 The 4th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2008.17	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;efficient energy use;packet switch;computer network	Mobile	8.890811682491183	84.98114840813014	148993
53dcadd168d99f12179a4696659b6c60d09b843c	an effective buffer management policy for opportunistic networks		Opportunistic networks are wireless networks where disruptions may occur frequently due to the challenging environments. Multiple message replicas have to be propagated to improve delivery probability; combining long-term storage with replication gives rise to a high storage overhead. Many forward/drop policies have been proposed to achieve high delivery ratio, low latencies and low overheads. These policies have improved the performance of opportunistic networks to some extent. However, they all have their own disadvantages. Therefore, an efficient buffer management policy based on the average encounter frequency and the average encounter duration of nodes is proposed in this paper. Simulation results show that our buffer management policy has better performance than the existing DO, DF, MDC-SR and the ACF-based policy.

36142bed29d8b856efbb0f74fd0cd00a2ae16ee9	energy-efficient cluster based routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks using network coding		Inmobile ad hoc networks, all nodes are energy constrained. In such situations, it is important to reduce energy consumption. In this paper, we consider the issues of energy efficient communication in MANETs using network coding. Network coding is an effective method to improve the performance of wireless networks. COPE protocol implements network coding concept to reduce number of transmissions by mixing the packets at intermediate nodes. We incorporate COPE into cluster based routing protocol to further reduce the energy consumption. The proposed energy-efficient coding-aware cluster based routing protocol (ECCRP) scheme applies network coding at cluster heads to reduce number of transmissions. We also modify the queue management procedure of COPE protocol to further improve coding opportunities. We also use an energy efficient scheme while selecting the cluster head. It helps to increase the life time of the network. We evaluate the performance of proposed energy efficient cluster based protocol using simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed ECCRP algorithm reduces energy consumption and increases life time of the network.	algorithm;computer cluster;effective method;hoc (programming language);linear network coding;network topology;routing;simulation	Srinivas Kanakala;Venugopal Reddy Ananthula;Prashanthi Vempaty	2014	Journal Comp.

a72a3bdbf41c32b28d1edeeb5530beae0813a815	optimization of relay node deployment for multisource multipath routing in wireless multimedia sensor networks using gaussian distribution		Abstract In Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, source nodes send intense multimedia traffic, under strict quality-of-service requirements, to the base station via resource-limited relay nodes. To satisfy such requirements, all discoverable routing paths must be concurrently utilized. The shorter the paths are, the lower the energy consumption and the shorter the packet delay are, resulting in an enhanced network lifespan and higher rates of data delivery. Optimizing the number and the deployment strategy of relay nodes has been a vital problem to solve. Focusing mainly on single source node scenarios, previous theoretical studies assumed that either a deterministic or a random uniform distribution of relay nodes is to be used. Recent studies, however, have proven that when practical deployment strategies are used, controllable Gaussian distributions of relay nodes can be achieved, and both network resources and routing performance can otherwise be optimized. This paper presents an analytical framework for the optimal deployment of relay nodes using a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Given the network parameters (such as number of sources nodes, communication range and number of routing paths needed) both the theoretical minimum number of relay nodes needed and the optimal standard deviation can be exactly determined. To validate the mathematical model and evaluate its performance, a simulation study has been conducted. Statistical analysis revealed that when optimal Gaussian distribution was used, instead of a uniform distribution, routing performance increased by at least twofold. That is sufficiently close to the ideal deterministic distribution. Additionally, the average path length and the number of control packets were considerably reduced, which can potentially improve energy consumption, packet delay, network lifetime and data delivery.

However, harsh and complex industrial environment pose great challenges toward real-time and reliable wireless communication. This necessitates a routing protocol that fulfils the industrial current real-time, reliable routing needs and opens the door for new applications that may arise in future. This study presents critical data reliable routing protocol for industrial real-time applications. That dynamically selects the reliable relay node by considering the data type, deadline time along with the recent parameters of the network. These parameters are selected in such a way that the critical data forwarding follow shorter path over speedy, reliable links and non-critical data forwarding follow the path over energy efficient nodes. In this way, the relay node selection process balances the network load that the shorter path remains available for the shorter deadline-time critical data. The results show improvement in timeliness data delivery along enhanced network life. As far as a node failure is concerned, the forwarding node fails to access potential relay node. Therefore, following transmission energy regulation mechanism optimises this problem with enhancing timeliness data delivery.	automation;operand forwarding;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;relay;routing	Manish Kumar;Rajeev Tripathi;Sudarshan Tiwari	2016	IET Wireless Sensor Systems	10.1049/iet-wss.2015.0060	wireless routing protocol;routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;engineering;dynamic source routing;path vector protocol;computer network	Embedded	8.895665448049117	82.07267351885694	150334

Typical MAC protocols for IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc networks employ a direct transmission strategy whenever the transmitter can directly reach the receiver (one-hop transmission). While such a design enjoys simplicity, it limits the number of admitted transmissions in a given neighborhood. Due to the performance anomaly of 802.11-based wireless networks, transmission with low data rates occupy the shared medium for longer periods of time. Occupying the transmission medium for a longer period of time results in less available transmission time for other nodes, which consequently reduces the number of transmitted packets during the same period of time, leading to a reduction in network throughput. To improve the overall network throughput, we present a cooperative multi-channel MAC protocol for single-hop wireless mobile ad hoc networks that attempts at computing the path with the minimum required transmission time for a given source-destination pair (including the channel assignment along that path). The proposed protocol attempts at improving network performance by means of cooperative communications. According to our approach, if the one-hop (direct) path between communicating nodes supports low data rate (requires longer transmission time), the source selects a multi-hop path to the destination such that the total amount of required transmission time is minimized. Through simulations, we show that our proposed protocol achieves significant throughput and fairness improvement compared to the standard IEEE 802.11-based protocol.	network packet;throughput	Haythem Bany Salameh;Amani Khasawneh;Osamah S.

26c30e9935e992dc6be611421f19c85d21ab63ac	a priority routing protocol based on location and moving direction in delay tolerant networks	routing protocol;delay tolerant network	Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a class of emerging networks that experience frequent and long-duration partitions. Delay is inevitable in DTNs, so ensuring the validity and reliability of the message transmission and making better use of buffer space are more important than concentrating on how to decrease the delay. In this paper, we present a novel routing protocol named Location and Direction Aware Priority Routing (LDPR) for DTNs, which utilizes the location and moving direction of nodes to deliver a message from source to destination. A node can get its location and moving direction information by receiving beacon packets periodically from anchor nodes and referring to received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for the beacon. LDPR contains two schemes named transmission scheme and drop scheme, which take advantage of the nodesu0027 information of the location and moving direction to transmit the message and store the message into buffer space, respectively. Each message, in addition, is branded a certain priority according to the messageu0027s attributes (e.g. importance, validity, security and so on). The message priority decides the transmission order when delivering the message and the dropping sequence when the buffer is full. Simulation results show that the proposed LDPR protocol outperforms epidemic routing (EPI) protocol, prioritized epidemic routing (PREP) protocol, and DTN hierarchical routing (DHR) protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, normalized routing overhead and average end-to-end delay. It is worth noting that LDPR doesnu0027t need infinite buffer size to ensure the packet delivery ratio as in EPI. In particular, even though the buffer size is only 50, the packet delivery ratio of LDPR can still reach 93.9%, which can satisfy general communication demand. We expect LDPR to be of greater value than other existing solutions in highly disconnected and mobile networks.	location-based service;routing	Jian Shen;Sangman Moh;Ilyong Chung	2010	IEICE Transactions		wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.138104468306605	84.24568429297027	151076

We first propose a utility maximization framework by leveraging the well-developed network congestion control, and formulate two subproblems, one on r ate control with fixed transmit powers and the other on power control with fixed rates. Distributed rate control and power control algorithms are developed to solve these two subprob lems, respectively, and are proved to be asymptotically optimal.Joint rate and power control can be done by using the two algorithms in an alternating fashion. The performance enhancement of o ur algorithms compared with a recent rate control algorithm, called EMBARC [1], is evaluated by using the network simulator ns2. I. I NTRODUCTION Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) service [2] is for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication in the5.9 GHz band. Among the75 MHz allocated to DSRC, the channel 172 (5.855 GHz –5.865 GHz) is assigned for critical safety operations, which allows vehicles to pe riodically exchange Basic Safety Messages ( BSM) to maximize the mutual awareness to prevent collisions. Such messages typically include the GPS position, velocity of the vehicle . By receiving theseBSM messages from surrounding vehicles, all participating vehicles in the DSRC safety system can ass ess the threat of potential collisions and provide warnings to t he driver, if necessary. United States Department of Transpor tation (USDOT) reported that the DSRC safety system based on this simple mechanism can address 80% of the traffic accidents on the road today and thus has potentially huge societal benefit. On the other hand, such benefit is possible only when timely and reliable information exchange among vehicles using DSRC can be guaranteed in all deployment scenarios. DSRC is based on IEEE 802.11p standards [3] at PHY and MAC layer. It has been well known that DSRC vehicular networks exhibit degraded performance in congested scenarios . In particular, excessive packet loss can be observed at high no de density even between vehicles which are in close proximity to each other [4], which can severely undermine the safety benefit targeted by deploying such networks. Performance improvement in such scenarios has been one of the key challenging issues for the success of DSRC. The industry and academics have contributed various solutions to this issue in a collaborative way over the last decade, e.g., [5], [6], [7] . J.Jose, C. Li and X. Wu are with Qualcomm Research; L,Ying and K. Zhu are with School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineer i g, Arizona State University. The authors are listed in alphabetical or der The key system parameters one may control at each vehicle are the transmit power and transmit rate, i.e. the periodici ty of the BSM messages, to alleviate the system congestion, i.e . lower transmit rate and power reduces the footprint and also the number of messages a DSRC device may generate and thus reduce the congestion level in the critical safety chan nel. On the other hand, both rate control and power control are critical for system performance as the transmit power of a vehicle determines the number of surrounding vehicles whic h can discover the vehicle and higher transmit rate of the BSM message can improve the accuracy the of collision estimatio n between two vehicles by having more message exchanges. Thus, a key problem to be addressed in the DSRC system is: How to choose the transmit rate and power for each vehicle in a distributed manner such that the overall system performan ce is maximized without creating excessive network congestio n, i.e. observing very high channel load in some locations of th e network? Both rate control and power control have been studied in the literature (e.g. [8], [9]). However, most of these works proposeheuristic methods to adjust the rate and (or) power in simplistic scenarios, e.g. single bottleneck scenarios (i.e., there is only one congested channel in the network). Further , some of the methods [6], [1] rely on the existence of global parameters for algorithm convergence, which leads to syste m resourceunder-utilizationin some scenarios. The focus of this paper 1 is to propose a network resource allocation framework for rate and power control in vehicula r network, by leveraging existing network congestion contro l framework [11] established in the context of wireline and wireless networks, and then develop optimal distributed ra te and power control algorithms to achieve such a goal. The main contributions of this paper are summarized below: • We propose a utility maximization framework for rate and power control in DSRC. In general, the utility maximization is a non-convex optimization problem with integer constraints. We separate the problem to two subproblems: rate control problem and power control problem, where the rate control problem is to find the optimal broadcast rates when the transmit power (i.e., the transmit ranges) of vehicles are fixed and the power control problem is to find the optimal transmit power (or transmission range) when the broadcast rates are fixed. • We develop a distributed rate control algorithm which is similar to the dual algorithm for the Internet congestion control and prove that the time-average total utility 1Partial version of this paper has appeared in [10].	asymptotically optimal algorithm;black–scholes model;control theory;convex optimization;entropy maximization;global positioning system;information exchange;key;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network packet;openbsm;optimization problem;phy (chip);simulation;software deployment;vehicle-to-vehicle;velocity (software development);whole earth 'lectronic link	Jubin Jose;Chong Li;Xinzhou Wu;Lei Ying;Kai Zhu	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	7.011965556788647	88.13762023155978	151120

So in this paper, we propose Encounter Tree Spray and Wait (ETSW) routing protocol combining with the respective advantages of them for routing in opportunistic networks, which exploits the encounter history of mobile nodes to reduce the blindness of data transmission between nodes. And the simulation results show that ETSW can improve the delivery rate, and reduce the transmission delay of data packets forwarding comparing with the traditional Spray and Wait routing protocols.	routing	Haoyan Liang;Zhigang Chen;Jia Wu;Peiyuan Guan	2017		10.1007/978-981-10-6893-5_4	wireless routing protocol;transmission delay;data transmission;computer network;network packet;blindness;exploit;routing protocol;transmission (mechanics);distributed computing;computer science	Mobile	3.8059302997070206	83.64077913268073	151276

However, these schemes cannot be directly used in battlefield environment due to lack of node location and topology information both of which caused by electronic warfare and random burst mode of communication. This paper proposes an efficient broadcast relaying scheme called Random Directional Broadcasting Relay (RDBR) scheme that greatly reduces the number of forwarding nodes and end-to-end delay while achieving high reachability in medium to high density environments. This is done by selecting a subset of neighboring nodes to relay the packet using directional antennas without relying on node location, network topology and complex angle-of-arrival (AoA) calculations. We evaluate the performance of our proposed RDBR scheme by comparing it against Flooding and Distance-based schemes. Simulation results show that our proposed RDBR scheme achieves high reachability while reducing both end-to-end delay and the number of retransmitting nodes.	angle of arrival;burst mode (computing);end-to-end principle;network packet;network topology;reachability;relay;simulation;tower array	Ahmed Karam;Liren Zhang;Abderrahmane Lakas	2015	2015 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)	10.1109/ICCVE.2015.66	telecommunications;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.304317902842402	86.30681079790907	151806

We discuss two types of interconnections. One type can be achieved by using PAN coordinator node as the bridging device and the other type is achieved by using ordinary network nodes as bridge nodes. We discuss design and performance issues of both kind of interconnections. I. I NTRODUCTION The recent IEEE 802.15.4 standard [1] for low rate wireless personal area networks supports small, cheap, energy-efficient devices operating on battery power that require little infrastructure to operate [2], [3]. It is considered as enabling technology for home networks and wireless sensor networks. IEEE 802.15.4 networks can appear in star topology where all communications are routed through the PAN coordinator or in peer-to-peer topology where nodes can communicate with each other directly while the PAN coordinator is still needed for cluster management [1]. Networks with peer-to-peer topology have homogeneous nodes with the same initial energy, computational resources and link capacity, while in star topology PAN coordinator can have higher energy, computational resources and potentially higher capacity of inter-coordinator links than ordinary nodes in the cluster. In the recent period, several evaluations related to the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 networks either in peer to peer or in cluster topology have been conducted and results have been reported in [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The choice of topology for IEEE 802.15.4 standard is still an open question. However, it seems that the choice of topology is an issue of tradeoff between the node simplicity and homogeneity versus the duration of network lifetime. For sensor networks covering large geographic areas it is difficult to replace sensor’s batteries when they are exhausted, and therefore, when nodes close to sink die the whole network is unavailable. It was shown in [14] that in the homogeneous network case, nodes close to the sink die first since their batteries are exhausted due to excessive packet relaying. The concept of power heterogeneity enhanced with link heterogeneity was further considered in [15] and it was proven that modest number of nodes with higher power can provide 5-fold increase of network life-time. For this reason we choose cluster with star topology as the basic network building block and explore the ways to achieve efficient cluster interconnection in order to implement larger networks. In this Chapter, we consider two 802.15.4 clusters operating in beacon enabled, slotted CSMA-CA mode; the clusters will be referred to as the source and sink cluster. The clusters can be interconnected in two ways: • In Master-Slave (MS) fashion, with the coordinator node of the source cluster acting as the bridge. • In Slave-Slave (SS)fashion where bridge is ordinary node in both clusters. The bridge periodically visits the sink cluster in order to deliver the data gathered from the sensor nodes in the source cluster. Bridge visits are made possible by the existence of active and inactive parts of the superframe, i.e., the bridge visits the sink cluster during the inactive period of the source cluster superframe. The bridge delivers its data either by competing with other nodes in the sink cluster using the CSMA-CA access mode, or by using the guaranteed time slots (GTS) allocated by the sink cluster coordinator. Also, standard [1] allows transmissions in the CSMA part of the superframe to be acknowledged giving base for the reliable MAC with re-transmissions or non-acknowledged which has applications in sensor networks where packets’ content is correlated. In this Chapter, we discuss and compare the performance of MS and SS based bridges. At this point we don’t consider power management algorithms explicitly since we target applications of both Personal Area Networks where reliable MAC is needed and Sensor Networks which can demand either reliable or non-reliable MAC. However, our framework is open for power management algorithms either through control of inactive superframe part or through individual power control for each node. The rest of the Chapter is organized as follows. In section II we review the properties of 802.15.4 beacon enabled MAC related to the operation of bridges. In Section III, we present the details of Master-Slave (MS) bridge operation. In Section 6 the operation of Slave-Slave (SS) bridge is described. In Section V, we discuss comparative performance issues of MS bridges and SS bridges. Finally, Section VI concludes the Chapter. II. BASIC PROPERTIES OFIEEE STD 802.15.4 MAC In beacon enabled networks the PAN coordinator divides its channel time into superframes [1]. Each superframe begins with the transmission of a network beacon, followed by an active portion and an optional inactive portion, as shown in Fig. 2. The coordinator interacts with its PAN during the active portion of the superframe, and may enter a low power mode during the inactive portion. The superframe duration, SD, is equivalent to the duration of the active portion of the superframe, which cannot exceed the beacon interval BI. All communications in the cluster take place during the active portion of the superframe, the duration of which is referred to as the superframe duration SD. The superframe is divided into 16 slots of equal size. Each slot consists of 3 · 2SO backoff periods which gives the shortest active superframe duration aBaseSuperframeDuration of 48 backoff periods. In the ISM band, the duration of the backoff period is 10 bytes, giving the maximum data rate of 250kbps. The duration of the active part of the superframe is SD = aBaseSuperframeDuration · 2SO (expressed in backoff periods), where the parameter SO= 0 . . 14 is known asmacSuperframeOrder . The time interval between successive beacons is BI = aBaseSuperframeDuration∗2BO, whereBO denotes the so-called macBeaconOrder . The duration of the inactive period of the superframe can easily be determined as I = aBaseSuperframeDuration ∗ (2BO − 2SO). While the default access mode in beacon enabled operation is slotted CSMA-CA, some slots may optionally be reserved for certain devices (GTS). Any device can request a GTS (one for uplink and/or one for downlink transmission), but the actual allocation is ultimately the responsibility of the cluster coordinator. The structure of the superframe is shown in Fig. 2. Data transfers from a node to PAN coordinator are synchronized with beacons as shown in Fig. 1(a) and are done using slotted CSMA-CA access described below. Data transfers from the coordinator are more complex and are first announced by the coordinator which transmits the list of nodes which have the pending downlink packets. The device periodically listens to the network beacon and if a packet is pending, transmits a MAC command requesting the data. MAC command frames are very short. The PAN coordinator acknowledges the successful reception of the data request by transmitting an acknowledgement frame. After the acknowledgement the node turns on its receivers for period of aMaxFrameResponseTimewhich is equal to 1220 symbols and the PAN coordinator has to transmit the pending frame within that period. Downlink transmission can be achieved without slotted CSMA-CA only if coordinator’s MAC layer can start transmission of the data frame between aTurnaroundTime(12 symbols) andaTurnaroundTime +	algorithm;basic;backoff;bridging (networking);byte;cluster manager;computational resource;computer cluster;data rate units;die (integrated circuit);frame (networking);global telecommunications system;implicit shape model;interconnection;master/slave (technology);microsoft windows;network packet;peer-to-peer;power management;reliability engineering;routing;std bus;single point of failure;star network;telecommunications link;transmitter;xfig	Jelena V.

c08462891ab4d40842f1f02c43ab235695a048bc	towards bandwidth and energy optimization in ieee 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks	ieee 802.15.4;slotted csma/ca;data fragmentation;nav;markov chains;energy consumption;bandwidth occupation;60j20	Transmission delay, throughput and energy are important criterions to consider in wireless sensor networks (WSN). In this way, IEEE 802.15.4 standard was conceived with the objective to reduce resource’s consumption in both WSN and wireless personal area networks. In such networks, the slotted CSMA/CA still occupies a prominent place as a channel control access mechanism with its inherent simplicity and reduced complexity. In this paper, we propose to introduce a network allocation vector (NAV), to reduce energy consumption and collisions in IEEE 802.15.4 networks. A Markov chain-based analytical model of the fragmentation mechanism, in a saturated traffic, is given as well as a model of the energy consumption using the NAV mechanism. The obtained results show that the fragmentation technique improves at the same time the throughput, the access delay and the bandwidth occupation. They, also, show that using the NAV allows reducing significantly the energy consumption when applying the fragmentation technique in slotted CSMA/CA under saturated traffic conditions.	bandwidth (signal processing);fragmentation (computing);markov chain;mathematical optimization;microsoft dynamics nav 2016;performance;throughput	Mouloud Atmani;Djamil Aïssani;Yassine Hadjadj Aoul	2017	Computing	10.1007/s00607-017-0583-4	ieee 802.11s;computer network;wireless sensor network;computer science;inter-access point protocol;neurfon;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;ieee 802.11b-1999;ieee 802.15;ieee 802.11r-2008	Embedded	9.402255077442	84.66212513059519	152138
ca27de4a75fbe3c70c72978ef637409a8e92da78	ss5g: collision resolution protocol for delay and energy efficient lora networks		Future 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) applications will heavily rely on long-range communication technologies such as low-power wireless area networks (LPWANs). In particular, LoRaWAN built on LoRa physical layer is gathering increasing interests, both from academia and industries, for enabling low-cost energy efficient IoT wireless sensor networks for, e.g., environmental monitoring over wide areas. While its communication range may go up to 20 kilometers, the achievable bit rates in LoRaWAN are limited to a few kilobits per second. In the event of collisions, the perceived rate is further reduced due to packet loss and retransmissions. Firstly, to alleviate the harmful impacts of collisions, we propose a decoding algorithm that enables to resolve several superposed LoRa signals. Our proposed method exploits the slight desynchronization of superposed signals and specific features of LoRa physical layer. Secondly, we design a full MAC protocol enabling collision resolution. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional LoRaWAN jointly in terms of system throughput, energy efficiency as well as delay. These results show that our scheme is well suited for 5G and IoT systems, as one of their major goals is to provide the best trade-off among these performance objectives.	algorithm;cyclic redundancy check;data rate units;decoding methods;hash table;internet of things;kilobit;low-power broadcasting;network packet;network performance;quantum superposition;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput	Nancy El Rachkidy;Alexandre Guitton;Megumi Kaneko	2018	CoRR		wireless sensor network;throughput;collision;computer network;packet loss;physical layer;decoding methods;efficient energy use;exploit;computer science	Mobile	9.441963746714015	88.10014942837626	152198
0c9c98462e46a69e4b19be78808770b5fde58dfc	energy efficient multipath routing protocol for manet for enhancing qos and qoe in multimedia applications		In mobile ad hoc network (MANET) the devices are interconnected by wireless manner that are able to ubiquitously retrieve contents such as video and audio streams, still images, and scalar sensor data from the environment. MANET provides low power in hazardous environment where replacement of fault evaluation in the MANET is impossible. Hence, development of an energy efficient network is essential in MANET, where the cost of network depends on the energy consumption of each mobile node. Overutilization of energy by a mobile node cannot contribute to the utility or the network as a whole. Hence to optimize the utilization of energy at each node, we propose an energy efficient multipath routing protocol for MANET for enhancing QoS and QoE metrics (EMRP-QQ), which can eventually minimize the data loss and hence there liability of the mobile nodes and the overall network. In our proposed approach an energy efficient clustering is performed using particle swarm optimization (PSO), where all the nodes are clustered without any residual nodes left in the system. Using the appropriate selection of CH and SCH the overall networks overhead utilization is reduced and hence the QoS of the network is enhanced. The result obtained through NS-2 simulation shows that the proposed algorithm performs better than FQ-MP-OLSR approach in terms of reduced energy consumption of each node without affecting QoS and QoE metrics.

In its simplest form flooding is realized by letting each node rebroadcast the flooded packet exactly once. To limit the scope of a flooded data packet, the sender of the packet may use ring flooding. For this, the packet's time-to-live (TTL) field is initially set to n. As the TTL of the packet expires after n hops, it only reaches all those nodes that are at most n hops away from the original sender. Ring flooding is used, e.g., to distribute information only relevant in a certain area such as emergency messages in car-to-car networks, or to do an expanding ring search during route discovery as in AODV [2].	hoc (programming language);network packet;time to live	Wolfgang Kiess;Andreas Tarp;Martin Mauve	2006	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/1215976.1215982	ring network;mobile ad hoc network;time to live;telecommunications;computer science;flooding;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.1270734146516768	82.08946099548173	153281

However, such approaches neglect the fact that vehicles transmission ranges are typically heterogeneous due to different transmission power values. In our previous work, we introduce new area-based methods for heterogeneous transmission ranges in vehicle networks, i.e. Area Defer Transmission (ADT), Area-based Probabilistic Transmission (APT), and an integration of area-based timer and probabilistic transmission methods. ADT proves it efficiency over distance-based methods, and the probabilistic version due to high delivery ratio, high propagation speed and reachability. The work is extended and we introduce an enhancement of ADT defer time formula. The enhancement gives vehicles with larger potential coverage area high opportunity to relay the message than the one with small potential coverage area or small communication range. The performance of the proposed enhancement is compared to ADT and evaluated using an actual road map with complex road scenarios and real movement traces. The simulation results show that the dissemination speed improves dramatically, with better saved-retransmission and delivery ratio.	heterogeneous computing;hoc (programming language);hop;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;overhead (computing);reachability;relay;retransmission (data networks);simulation;software propagation;timer;tracing (software);transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter	Maryam M.

19e5f988fff377f7bb934a90d282de3fe828420b	a social-based dtn routing in cooperative vehicular sensor networks		As a cooperative information system, vehicles in Vehicular Sensor Networks delivery messages based on collaboration. Due to the high speed of vehicles, the topology of the network is highly dynamic, and the network may be disconnected frequently. So how to transfer large files in such network is worth considering. In case that the encountering nodes which never meet before flood messages blindly to cause tremendous network overhead. We address this challenge by introducing the Encounter Utility Rank Router(EURR) based on social metrics. EURR includes three cases: Utility Replication Strategy, Lifetime Replication Strategy and SocialRank Replication Strategy. The Lifetime Replication is promising complement to Utility Replication. It enhances the delivery ratio by relaying the copy via the remaining lifetime. Considering network overhead, the SocialRank Replication replicates a copy according to the SocialRank when two communicating nodes do not meet before. The routing mechanism explores the utility of history encounter information and social opportunistic forwarding. The results under the scenario show an advantage of the proposed Encounter Utility Rank Router (EURR) over the compared algorithms in terms of delivery ratio, average delivery latency and overhead ratio.	algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;information system;metrics (networking);network congestion;overhead (computing);router (computing);routing	Tong Wang;Yongzhe Zhou;Xibo Wang;Yue Cao	2018	Int.

Additional applications including object tracking have also been proposed for ITS. Object tracking system can be used for visual tracking of specific vehicles or monitoring particular areas and reporting schemes. Tracking, however, can generate large volume of data, which can easily overcome the wireless network in VANET. The Development of low-delay, low-overhead, and precise tracking system in VANETs is a major challenge requiring novel techniques to guarantee performance.

8f3d5757ac7c79e334555bf9d33acf8ba6bd7d7e	a lifetime-enhanced data collecting scheme for the internet of things		A backpressure-based data collecting scheme has been applied in the Internet of Things, which can control the network congestion effectively and increase the network throughput. However, there is an obvious shortcoming in the traditional backpressure data collecting scheme for the network service chain. It attempts to search all possible paths between source node and destination node in the networks, causing an unnecessary long path for data collection, which results in large end-toend delay and redundant energy consumption. To address this shortcoming of backpressure data collecting scheme in the Internet of Things, this article proposes an energy-aware and distance-aware data collecting scheme to enhance the lifetime of backpressure-based data collecting schemes. We propose an energy- and distance-based model that combines the factors of queue backlog, hop counts, and residual energy for making routing decisions. It not only reduces the unnecessary energy consumption, but also balances the residual energy. The experiment results show that the proposed scheme can reduce unnecessary energy consumption and end-to-end delay compared to the traditional and LIFO-based schemes. Meanwhile, it balances the energy of nodes and extends the lifetime of an Internet of Things.	end-to-end principle;internet of things;network congestion;routing;throughput	Tie Qiu;Ruixuan Qiao;Min Han;Arun Kumar Sangaiah;Ivan Lee	2017	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700033	computer science;wireless sensor network;network service;computer network;throughput;hop (networking);network congestion;energy consumption;distributed computing;backpressure routing;queue	Mobile	7.642052369529711	82.63793502625549	154417

The data streams are sent to the receiver on the highest date rate path from the source vehicles. The method does not rely upon a location service for obtaining position information. Moreover, as the source and the receivers move from one position to the other, the paths are recomputed dynamically without any explicit position information notification. The forwarding method adapts rapidly, and in a distributed manner, as the conditions on the roads change due to vehicle mobility, radio propagation etc. Based on performance evaluations, we observe that the proposed protocol converges rapidly towards the forwarding method that ensures highest achieved data rates.	data rate units;hop;location-based service;software propagation	Ratul K.

The proposed model takes advantages of both ETX and MF metrics thus enhancing the overall routing performance for MANET in different mobility states.

These nodes execute special routing protocols, which help to establish multi-hop communication despite a dynamic topology. The greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) protocol is one such routing protocol that is frequently used to establish routes in an ad-hoc or sensor network. However, for its precise execution, it is imperative that all nodes depict sustained benevolent behaviour. However, such an altruistic setting would never work in a wireless environment, which is intrinsically physically insecure. Consequently, participating malicious nodes may launch an array of attacks against the routing protocol leading to route severing, elongation or loop creation. In this paper, we present an improved variant of the GPSR protocol that uses the inherent characteristics of the routing process to assess the trust in the network nodes. These trust levels are then used to influence the routing decisions so as to circumvent malevolent nodes in the network. Extensive simulations indicate that the packet delivery ratio of the trusted GPSR protocol surpasses that of the standard GPSR by as much as 30% when as many as 50% of the nodes are acting maliciously in the network.	computation;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);imperative programming;malware;mobile phone;network packet;simulation;stateless protocol	Asad Amir Pirzada;Chris McDonald	2007	2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks	10.1109/ICON.2007.4444087	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.7783597398494613	82.32977452664349	156133

However, due to the highly dynamic mobility in VANETs, it remains a difficult problem to deliver messages to a group of moving vehicles scattering over the whole network. The contribution of this paper is to propose the first trajectory-based I2V group message delivery protocol, TGMD, that exploits vehicle trajectories to improve the group-message delivery performance. TGMD contains two phases. The first phase determines a few rendezvous points from which the member vehicles can receive the message. Then the second phase transmits the group message over multiple hops to these selected rendezvous points using a multicast-like forwarding scheme to avoid redundant packet transmissions over the overlapped road segments. TGMD aims to minimize the required number of network-layer packet transmissions under a relatively loose delay constraint. Our extensive simulation results indicate that in comparison with the trajectory-based single-destination I2V message delivery scheme (through N-unicasting), TGMD significantly reduces the required number of packet transmissions (and thus bandwidth consumption) while achieving a high delivery ratio around 90%.	heuristic;hoc (programming language);multicast;network packet;shortest path problem;simulation;unicast	Wan-Han Hsieh;Shun-Ren Yang;Guann-Long Chiou	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363747	communications protocol;message passing;telecommunications;tin;computer science;trajectory;operating system;distributed computing;redundancy;server;computer network	Mobile	3.056141787285596	83.75273353994103	156555

This paper explores the capability of these networks to support multicast traffic, where each source node desires to send packets to k distinct destinations and all nodes move according to the generalized hybrid random walk mobility model. We show how the network capacity and related delay/delay jitter for supporting multicast in such ICMNs are scaling with the basic network parameters under three transmission protocols: one-hop relay, two-hop relay without packet redundancy and two-hop relay with packet redundancy.	gps wildlife tracking;habitat;hoc (programming language);image scaling;multicast;network packet;packet delay variation;relay	Jiajia Liu;Xiaohong Jiang;Hiroki Nishiyama;Nei Kato	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195648	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	4.479928606478592	85.75756692303155	156704

The design of efficient routing protocols is a fundamental problem in MANETs. Researchers have proposed a number of routing protocols in literature. This survey treats about a bio-inspired routing protocol called AntOR for these networks. Thus, one of its key aspects is disjoint route property. The simulation results show that the disjoint-link property has a better performance than disjoint-node according to metrics such as average End-to-End Delay and Jitter.	hoc (programming language);routing	Delfín Rupérez Cañas;Ana Lucila Sandoval Orozco;L.

Since the mobile nodes form a constantly changing topology, the design of efficient and scalable routing protocols is a fundamental challenge in MANETs. In the current literature, position-based routing protocols are regarded as having better scalability and lower control overhead than topology-based routing protocols. Since location services are the most critical part of position-based routing protocols, we present a multi-home-region scheme, Distributed Virtual Home Region with Spatial Awareness (DVHR-SA), to improve the performance of location service in this paper. Our scheme adaptively selects different update and query procedures according to the location of a source node. The simulation results show that DVHR-SA shortens the lengths of the update, query and reply paths. Our scheme also reduces the overall network message overhead. Therefore, DVHR-SA is considerably fast and stable.	spatial–temporal reasoning	Shyr-Kuen Chen;Tay-Yu Chen;Pi-Chung Wang	2010	IEICE Transactions		policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.923972896271833	82.23232072796179	157184

Degradation happens due to interference resulting in packet drops, retransmissions, link instability and inconsistent protocol behavior. We have conducted experiments that highlight the fact that interference caused by WiFi and co-channel contention significantly degrades the network performance of protocols. These potential sources of interference must therefore be accounted for during the design stage of a WSN in order to achieve acceptable network performance. Based on these observations, we have proposed a multi-hop multi-channel topology control protocol RMMTC for WSN that takes into account interference caused by WiFi networks in operation in the vicinity and uses multiple channels at different frequencies to mitigate the effect of co-channel interference. This paper details the design and performance evaluation of our proposed RMMTC protocol using both simulations and empirical experiments. In addition, we have formulated the multiple channel assignment problem as an Integer linear program (ILP) and compared the performance of our distributed protocol with the centralized ILP solution. The simulation results show that RMMTC performs close to the optimal centralized ILP and achieves a nine-fold reduction in the percentage of dropped packets when a dense network is subjected to interference from WiFi and co-channel contention.	assignment problem;centralized computing;elegant degradation;experiment;instability;interference (communication);linear programming;network packet;network performance;performance evaluation;simulation;software deployment;testbed;topology control	Nadeem Ahmed;Salil S.

However, accurate and timely information of the disaster area is important because first responders rely on this information to assess the situation in the affected area and to provide an effective and immediate assistance. In this paper, a data collection method from an area of interest (AoI) within the disaster zone is proposed that uses the mobile phones of the people to serve as sensing nodes. In order for maximum AoI coverage to be achieved while minimizing delay, we propose a disruption tolerant network (DTN)-based data aggregation method. In this method, mobile phone users create messages containing disaster-related information and merge them with their respective coverage areas resulting in a new message with the merged coverage. The merging or aggregation of multiple messages will reduce message size and minimize the overall message collection delay. However, simply merging the messages can result in duplicate counting thus, to prevent this, a Bloom filter is constructed for each message. Also, to reduce further the message delivery time, the expected reaching time of a node to its destination is introduced as a routing metric. Through computer simulation with a real geographical map, the proposed method achieved a 9.7% decrease in information collection delay confirming that the proposed method achieved a smaller delay with a smaller number of total exchanged messages in collecting disaster information covering the AoI than epidemic routing.	algorithm;bloom filter;cartography;computer simulation;dfa minimization;data aggregation;delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;half-life 2: episode one;metrics (networking);mobile device;mobile phone;participatory sensing;routing	Jovilyn Therese B.

Although structured approaches are particularly useful for data gathering applications, they incur high maintenance overhead in dynamic scenarios for event-based applications. Moreover, a WSN should be capable of timely fulfilling its mission without losing important information in event-critical applications. In this paper, we focus on designing a structure-free Real-time data AGgregation protocol, RAG, using two mechanisms for temporal and spatial convergence of packets – Judiciously Waiting policy and Real-time Data-aware Anycasting policy. Using extensive simulations in NS-2, we investigate the performance of RAG in terms of aggregation gain, miss ratio, energy consumption, and end-to-end delay for WSNs. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In such environment, due to the delay-tolerant nature of the network, designing a routing protocol is a challenge. This paper proposes a novel routing protocol called Encounter and Distance based Routing (EDR), which utilizes the so-called forward parameter to determine the next hop selection. This parameter is calculated by taking into account the number of encounters and the distance of each node in the network with respect to a particular destination. Simulation results are provided, showing the superiority of EDR over the History based Prediction for Routing (HBPR) protocol and the ProWait protocol, chosen as benchmark schemes, in terms of hop count, messages dropped, and average latency.	benchmark (computing);bluetooth;computer simulation;encounter;mobile device;routing	Sanjay Kumar Dhurandher;Satya Jyoti Borah;Isaac Woungang;Deepak Kumar Sharma;Kunal Arora;Divyansh Agarwal	2016	2016 IEEE 30th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2016.15	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;genetic algorithm;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;measurement;computer network	Mobile	3.214364467206725	84.34385300724071	159215

Since, the VNDN is at its early stage in development, there are several open issues to be explored and pending interest table (PIT) management is one of them. In VNDN, PIT stores each broadcasted interest until the required content is retrieved or its timer (PEL: PIT entry lifetime) expires. When the PIT storage is full, the vehicles discard new incoming interests, thus decreasing the network performance. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a dynamic PEL (DPEL) scheme that enables each relaying vehicle to dynamically compute PEL timer for each incoming interest using its interest satisfaction rate (ISR) and the hop count. The higher the ISR and the longer the hop count, the shorter the time the relaying vehicle keeps the PIT entry. Simulation results show DPEL reduces by more than 75% the PEL and the number of entries in VNDN.	downstream (software development);information systems research;network performance;search algorithm;simulation;timer	Safdar Hussain Bouk;Syed Hassan Ahmed;Muhammad Azfar Yaqub;Dongkyun Kim;Mario Gerla	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2508798	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.403627225717098	87.30697905427061	159326

Moreover, energy conservation may be attained only if valuable MAC (and PHY) input is passed to the network layer. Hence, in this paper, we propose two schemes the objective of which is to enhance the operation of existing power-based multi-path routing protocols via cross-layer designs and optimal load assignments. Our proposed schemes, namely, Energy-Constrained Path Selection (ECPS) and Energy-Efficient Load Assignment (E2LA), employ probabilistic dynamic programming techniques and utilize cross-layer interactions between the network and MAC layers. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first time that MAC-originated information is used as the basis for achieving energy-efficient routing.	access control;dynamic programming;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);interaction;multipath routing;phy (chip)	Ahmed M.

The proposed cross layer protocol, XLRP, explores an efficient routing strategy based on the application layer information along with the capabilities of the physical layer. Protocol design in wireless sensor networks have always resorted to low transmitter power levels as an energy efficient strategy with minimum interference. The proposed routing algorithm substantiates on switching transmission power levels based on the volume of the data being transmitted as an energy efficient mechanism. The cross layer design proposes a back-off mechanism by switching OFF unintended receivers based on the power of the received radio signal. In addition, the protocol reduces control message exchange by piggy-backing information and extracting information from packets received by unintended receivers. The effectiveness of the proposed protocol is demonstrated through simulation in ns2. The concept of operating the transmitter at various power levels is shown to be an energy efficient, scalable approach with a rational throughput.	algorithm;communications protocol;interference (communication);osi model;programming paradigm;radio wave;routing;scalability;sensor;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Raghul Gunasekaran;Hairong Qi	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.378	wireless routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;resource reservation protocol;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.394460723999428	83.74226190747812	160357

Specifically, the links in such a network are too volatile to maintain a consistent topology, rendering most MANET protocols ineffective. At the same time, store-and-forward (DTN) techniques are not an option due to the need for delay intolerance, and may be unnecessary due to the likely availability of contemporaneous, albeit rapidly changing, paths. We present a novel routing mechanism called FansyRoute, aimed at this challenged region between MANETs and DTNs. FansyRoute adaptively adjusts the number of replications (fan-out) on a per-node basis, taking into account the level of intermittency along the path to the destination and a user-specified tradeoff between delivery expectation and the cost of replication. We study the performance of two FansyRoute schemes on a prime example of such variably intermittently connected networks, namely asynchronously duty-cycled sensor networks. Using ns-3, we compare FansyRoute to OLSR, AODV and Flooding. The results show that in an intermittent network, FansyRoute can deliver 50% more packets than the single path protocols, with less than 5% of the replication incurred by flooding. FansyRoute replicates only when needed and the replication is restricted to the challenged regions of the network.	delay-tolerant networking;fan-out;optimized link state routing protocol;store and forward	Stephen Dabideen;Ram Ramanathan	2013		10.1145/2505494.2505498	multipath propagation;routing;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive behavior;fan-out;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.82851868571365	83.86377549870892	160465

In this paper, we propose the priority-based coverage-aware congestion control (PCC), which is a distributed, priority-distinct, and fair mechanism. PCC provides higher priority to packets with event information, which the sink is more interested in. PCC employs a queue scheduler which can selectively drop any packet in the queue. PCC gives fair chance to all sensors to transmit packets to the sink, irrespective of their specific locations, and therefore enhances the coverage fidelity of WSNs. Based on a detailed simulation analysis, we show that PCC can efficiently relieve congestion and significantly improve the system performance based on multiple metrics such as event throughput and coverage fidelity.	algorithm;buffer overflow;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network packet;portable c compiler;scalability;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;throughput	Xiaoling Qiu;Dipak Ghosal;Biswanath Mukherjee;Jennifer Yick;Deshi Li	2008	2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops	10.1109/ICDCS.Workshops.2008.99	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;computer network	Mobile	8.23537779581661	84.02226203409302	160484

However, one of the key challenges of directional nodes to discover their neighbors in bounded delay; because, node discovery require two nodes to beam form their antennas to each other simultaneously. In this paper, we have developed a COllaborative Neighbor Discovery (COND) mechanism for DSNs, where each node polls to discover its neighbors in a distributed way.

In this paper, we present some energy efficient hierarchal routing protocols, prosper from conventional Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) routing protocol. Fundamental objective of our consideration is to analyze, how these extended routing protocols work in order to optimize lifetime of network nodes and how quality of routing protocols is improved for WSNs. Furthermore, this paper also emphasizes on some issues experienced by LEACH and also explains how these issues are tackled by other enhanced routing protocols from classical LEACH. We analytically compare the features and performance issues of each hierarchal routing protocol. We also simulate selected clustering routing protocols for our study in order to elaborate the enhancement achieved by ameliorate routing protocols.	algorithm;centralized computing;cluster analysis;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;mathematical optimization;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Muhammad Shamrooz Aslam;Muhammad Babar Rasheed;Tauseef Shah;Azizur Rahim;Zahoor Ali Khan;Umar Qasim;M.

The basis of this protocol is a reward-based scheme in which intermediate nodes forward packets and receive a reward proportional to the degree of exposure they generate. By means of a simulation campaign over the NS-3 framework, we assess that RBRP clearly outperforms a legacy approach in terms of exposure, while it does not show a worse behaviour, when considering other figures of merit.	mesh networking;routing;simulation;wireless mesh network	Voichita Iancu;Luis Francisco Díez;Laura Rodríguez de Lope;Emil Slusanschi;Ramón Agüero	2014	2014 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2014.7020834	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;switched mesh;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;wi-fi array;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.3203879860620913	84.45249996514434	161335

In this paper, we have modified the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm to partition the network into clusters such as to ensure that the resulted clusters are both spatially efficient and are sharing equal data transmission load. Further in this paper, we have re-defined the medium access protocol for cluster heads. The proposed medium access protocol is dependent upon the data traffic at the Cluster heads. Cluster heads with high traffic are given preference to access the channel and cluster head(s) having low traffic are made to wait for comparatively higher back-off time. By giving more time to cluster heads with lower initial data to collect more data, energy efficiency of the system is increased and contention losses are decreased due to reduction in number of transmissions between cluster heads and sink. The proposed method has been simulated and compared with LEACH protocol, a FCM based clustering protocol and Zonal based Deterministic Energy Efficient Clustering Protocol. The simulation results show that our proposed method performs better in terms of network performance parameters viz. network lifetime, energy dissipation, throughput and packet delivery ratio.	algorithm;coupled cluster	Aarti Jain	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4258-4	real-time computing;throughput;computer network;wireless sensor network;scalability;computer science;efficient energy use;cluster analysis;data transmission;network performance;algorithm;network packet	Mobile	8.450650006409555	82.04622001375668	161528

This work analyses the use of random linear network coding techniques in land mobile satellite channels to reliably deliver machine-to-machine traffic to mobile nodes in urban areas. The considered scenario takes into account a cooperative coverage extension in land mobile satellite vehicular networks, where the use of random linear network coding techniques can remove the need for any fixed equipment on the ground at least in urban environments, where the density of mobile nodes is typically high.

To perform efficient route planning, real-time traffic information should be collected and disseminated to vehicles on other road segments. vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are a promising technology that can provide the communication means to deliver the required traffic information. In this paper, we study and evaluate three state-of-the-art dissemination protocols in realistic vehicular scenarios. The evaluated protocols are geocast-based beacon piggybacking protocol, a low-overhead adaptation of it and greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR). As performance metrics we measure the average end-to-end delay, average routing overhead and the packet delivery ratio as a function of traffic density. The goal is to find a reliable dissemination protocol that fulfills the application requirements and requires low routing overhead. Simulation results show that all three protocols achieve the requirements of dynamic route planning in end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio. However, a significant reduction in the routing overhead can be achieved by the modified piggybacking protocol.	communications protocol;delay-gradient congestion control;design review (u.s. government);end-to-end principle;geocast;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;piggybacking (security);real-time clock;requirement;simulation;stateless protocol	Ibrahim Rashdan;Fabian de Ponte Müller;Stephan Sand	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881161	policy-based routing;planning;wireless routing protocol;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;vehicle dynamics;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;route poisoning;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;distance-vector routing protocol;transport engineering;split horizon route advertisement;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.3374539506627237	85.07974088496918	162385

It allows video/audio streaming to be transferred between sensor nodes in real-time. WSN can use realtime forwarding which means messages in the network are delivered according to their end-to-end deadlines (packet lifetime). This paper proposes a novel realtime routing protocol based on link quality, packet velocity over one-hop and remaining power in the sensor devices.

Based on the residual energy and communication load of each node, this protocol creates some routes from the source node to destination node, and then chooses a route to send data packets according to their reliability. When the route breaks up caused by the node's mobility or running out of energy, this protocol will choose a backup node which has a strong communication capability to forward data packets according to the backup routings information. The simulation results on OMNET++ shows that this protocol has a good performance on network life cycle, latency, packet transmission rate and so on.	backup;distance-vector routing protocol;hoc (programming language);network packet;simulation	Shuangyin Ren;Huanmin Han;Baoliang Li;Jia Lu;Chao Peng;Wenhua Dou	2012	2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2012.153	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.205710105782819	83.08263564729965	162892
b8efb2aecf52a3879c65d7ba9fa2d0e1b344fd49	smallworld routing for tactical networks	routing protocols;probability;routing;packet loss;directional antennas;delays	In mission critical networks, nodes need to communicate with minimum delay and loss. This calls for routing protocols that can quickly and efficiently route the application traffic to their destinations. This paper proposes a distance-based routing protocol, named as Smallworld, which finds efficient routes to target nodes often through a very short chain of intermediate nodes, without using any routing table like other standard routing protocols. This protocol exploits the “small-world” phenomenon of social networks where source-destination pairs typically get connected through few intermediate friends and the individuals can collectively discover such short paths. The key idea behind this routing protocol is that for forwarding an incoming packet to the destination, a node picks the next hop from between a one-hop neighbor, from its one-hop neighborhood that is closest to the destination, and a randomly selected long-distance neighbor, i.e., from outside of its one-hop neighborhood, based on which of these two neighbors is closer to the destination. This simple but effective algorithm can meet mission performance objectives by reducing packet losses, end-to-end delays, hop-counts, connectivity drops and control overheads in many tactical scenarios of interest.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;hop-by-hop transport;mission critical;network packet;randomness;routing table;small-world experiment;smallworld;social network	Pratik K.

It requires stable and secure wireless communications for mutual information exchange among vehicles. In order to realize stable and secure communications, packet loss due to collisions need to be suppressed and communication apparatus should be ensured to perform proper cryptographic verification of packets. Because the hardware constraints in cooperative systems allow only a limited rate for cryptographic processing of packets, congestion control acts as a key technology to solve these challenges. This paper proposes a congestion control algorithm for vehicular cooperative systems to control the packet reception rate at a communication apparatus of a vehicle. The proposed algorithm is evaluated quantitatively by network simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithm can stabilize the packet reception rate by controlling the packet transmission rate on surrounding vehicles in a decentralized manner.	algorithm;consensus dynamics;cryptography;information exchange;mutual information;network congestion;network packet;secure communication;simulation	Tatsuaki Osafune;Yuki Horita;Nestor Mariyasagayam;Massimiliano Lenardi	2015	Int.

We assume each node knows its geographical position and the position of the node to which it wants to send a packet. Initially, the nodes know only their neighbors, but over time they discover other nodes in the network. The routing table at a node S is a list h(pi; Si)i, where pi is a geographical position and Si is a neighbor of node S. When node S receives a packet for a node D at position pos(D), it finds the pi in its routing table which is closest to pos(D) and forwards the packet to the neighbor Si. We prove the correctness of the algorithm and show that our algorithm naturally aggregates the nodes so that the routing tables remain small. We show that the mean routing table size is O( L logn), where L is the average number of hops between two nodes and n is the number of nodes in the network. We also present methods for taking positional errors, node failures and mobility into account.

In order to monitor the entire coverage area of the WSN while maintaining acceptable network throughput, we need to find the optimal rate allocation for the individual/competing end-to-end sessions that maximizes the total proportionally fair throughput of the network. We provide closed form expressions for the optimal end-to-end session rates for square, triangular and hexagonal topologies as well as the bounds for the link layer transmission probabilities. We study the aforementioned problem for regular WSNs with a slotted Aloha MAC layer, which provides us with a lower bound for more realistic MAC protocols. Real world experiments using Telosb nodes validate our theories and results. Simulations carried out in Qualnet verify our comparisons of the different regular topologies as the size of network grows.	computer simulation;end-to-end principle;experiment;network packet;network planning and design;proportionally fair;sensor;throughput	Vaibhav Pandit;Jung Hyun Jun;Sriram Narayanan;Dharma P.

In particular we examine how the statistics of path durations including PDFs vary with the parameters such as the mobility model, relative speed, number of hops, and radio range. We find that at low speeds, certain mobility models may induce multi-modal distributions that reflect the characteristics of the spatial map, mobility constraints and the communicating traffic pattern. However, our study suggests that at moderate and high velocities the exponential distribution with appropriate parameterizations is a good approximation of the path duration distribution for a range of mobility models. The reciprocal of the average path duration is analytically shown to have a strong linear relationship with the throughput and overhead that is confirmed by the simulation results for DSR.	ansi escape code;approximation;link-state routing protocol;modal logic;overhead (computing);portable document format;simulation;throughput;time complexity	Narayanan Sadagopan;Fan Bai;Bhaskar Krishnamachari;Ahmed Helmy	2003		10.1145/778415.778444	path analysis;exponential distribution;mobile ad hoc network;performance;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobility model;mobile computing;statistics;computer network	Metrics	3.413565310914941	86.21258562834595	165650

Thus, the conventional WSN MAC protocols are bound by the energy-latency tradeoff. To break through the tradeoff, we propose a radio wave sensor called RF watchdog that is dedicated to sense the presence of a RF signal. The distinctive feature of our design is that the RF watchdog can provide the same sensitivity but with two orders of magnitude less energy than the underlying RF module. With RF watchdog a sensor node no longer requires duty cycling. Instead, it can maintain a sleep state until its RF watchdog detects a communication signal. We also propose an on-demand MAC protocol called ZeroMAC that can effectively utilize the on-demand wakeup functionality of a RF watchdog by broadcasting a dedicated signal to wake up nodes before starting a communication. ZeroMAC wakes up only the nodes on the communication path by propagating wakeup signals in a hop-by-hop manner, avoiding unnecessary signal flooding. To further save energy, a node in ZeroMAC can turn off its RF module as soon as it detects the end of communication. According to our detailed packet level simulation results, ZeroMAC can deliver data packets at least 1.87 times faster by eliminating both idle listening and sleep delay while it consumes only 3% of the energy compared to X-MAC and A-MAC.	a-mac;design rule for camera file system;duty cycle;hop-by-hop transport;imperative programming;network packet;radio frequency;radio wave;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;transmitter;watchdog timer	Sang Hoon Lee;Yong Soo Bae;Lynn Choi	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503172	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.966899030562441	84.22246578854966	165708

The AODV routing protocol is one of the applied protocols in such networks since it can adapts to network continuous topology changes. Nevertheless, its performance may suffer from high frequency VANET dynamics as they cause frequent link failures. In this paper, we present a proposal to enhance the operation of the native AODV routing protocol by the Route Life Time (RLT) mechanism so designing a novel VANET routing protocol baptized the RLT-AODV. This protocol can adapt rapidly to continuous network changes thereby maintaining the established routes as long as possible. We carried a performance evaluation of AODV-RLT by means of simulation by regards to the following metrics: network throughput, round-trip time (RTT), transmission overhead (TOH) and the successfully packets delivered ratio (SPDR). We show that the AODV-RLT protocol is able to achieve stable network throughput compared to AODV which suffers from frequent disconnections. Besides, the measured RTT for AODV-RLT is half of that obtained with AODV. In addition, AODV-RLT protocol yields a decrease of 81% and an increase of about 13% in the TOH and the SPDR respectively compared to AODV routing protocol. Given these results we proceeded to apply the RLT technique on the DSR routing protocol and we observed that DSR-RLT performs higher network throughput than AODV-RLT.	ansi escape code;distance-vector routing protocol;network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;simulation;throughput	Ilhem Lengliz;Afef Slama	2016	2016 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)	10.1109/ISNCC.2016.7746097	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.092784766238202	84.35790195034538	166325

To overcome this issue, researchers have proposed to use node mobility to carry data around the network. These schemes are referred to as mobility-assisted routing schemes. A mobility-assisted routing scheme forwards data only when appropriate relays meet each other. The time it takes for them to first meet each other is referred to as the meeting time. The time duration they remain in contact with each other is called the contact time. If they fail to exchange the packet during the contact time (due to contention in the network), then they have to wait till they meet each other again. This time duration is referred to as the inter meeting time. A realistic performance analysis of any mobility-assisted routing scheme requires a knowledge of the statistics of these three quantities. These quantities vary largely depending on the mobility model at hand. This paper studies these three quantities for the three most popularly used mobility models: random direction, random waypoint and random walk models. Hence, this work allows for a realistic performance analysis of any routing scheme under any of these three mobility models	end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);network packet;profiling (computer programming);relay;routing;waypoint	Apoorva Jindal;Konstantinos Psounis	2007	Fifth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerComW'07)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.52	optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;information engineering;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;mobility model;statistics;computer network	Mobile	3.5779051726629807	86.06649382826419	166338
808e3d37dbe85abae441e5b55746baec66c1bcac	maner: managed data dissemination scheme for lora iot enabled wildlife monitoring system (wms)		In this paper, we introduce dual radio based IoT network architecture for wildlife monitoring system (WMS). This solution will facilitate an IoT devices to be deployed for sustainable wildlife monitoring applications. In addition we present MANER, a managed data dissemination scheme for WMS. In MANER, data forwarding is optimized with a replication function to control and prioritize data dissemination. In WMS scenario wild animals show a sparsely con- specific mobility, which often results in a sporadic wireless link among nodes. Unlike existing opportunistic algorithms, MANER optimally makes forwarding decisions by leveraging locally available information. Hence, the proposed algorithm adopts to dynamic network topology due to the inherent intermittent connectivity among mobile herd of animals. We evaluated the performance of MANER by considering standard and real-life mobility models. Experimental results indicated that MANER decreases the average latency by up-to 65\%, when compared to benchmark opportunistic algorithms. In addition MANER readily increased the network delivery ratio for various data traffic rates.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;network architecture;network packet;network topology;operand forwarding;prototype;real life;simulation;sparse matrix	Eyuel D.

a41d1932c2746fa55d1e8633c76a9560273fdcd0	efficient data aggregation with in-network integrity control for wsn	integrity control;data aggregation;wireless sensor networks	Energy is a scarce resource in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Some studies show that more than 70% of energy is consumed in data transmission in WSN. Since most of the time, the sensed information is redundant due to geographically collocated sensors, most of this energy can be saved through data aggregation. Furthermore, data aggregation improves bandwidth usage and reduces collisions due to interference. Unfortunately, while aggregation eliminates redundancy, itmakes data integrity verification more complicated since the received data is unique. In this paper, we present a new protocol that provides control integrity for aggregation in wireless sensor networks. Our protocol is based on a two-hop verification mechanism of data integrity. Our solution is essentially different from existing solutions in that it does not require referring to the base station for verifying and detecting faulty aggregated readings, thus providing a totally distributed scheme to guarantee data integrity. We carried out numerical analysis and simulations using the TinyOS environment. Results show that the proposed protocol yields significant savings in energy consumption while preserving data integrity, and outperforms comparable solutions with respect to some important performance criteria. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, general cooperation enforcement mechanisms do not consider node battery, so hotspot node issue may exist; even badly lead to network separation. This paper proposes an Energy Fairness Cooperation Enforcement Mechanism (EFCEM) in ad hoc networks. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results show that the EFCEM protocol, comparing with the traditional reputation mechanisms, can prolong networks existence time and improve network throughput, but at the cost of a little more packets delay.	fairness measure;hoc (programming language);profiling (computer programming)	Wu Hao;Ding Yi-ming;Li Cheng-shu	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77024-4_55	computer simulation;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.107486853037744	81.83532651011842	166955

244943650cb99ef9532939d0bcb353bdfc6d56f1	hierarchical routing for integrated space/air information networks		An integrated space/air information network is a convergence of satellite communication networks in space regions and aircraft communication networks in air regions. It supports direct internal information interactions. Along with the extensive application of the integrated space/air information network especially in military fields, its routing problem becomes a key point of research. However, the existing routing algorithms are mainly designed for the space or air region separately and there is little study on the generalized routing for the integrated space/air information network. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid time-space Graph based Hierarchical Routing (HGHR) scheme for this integrated network. The hybrid time-space graph includes two subgraphs: a deterministic one and a semi-deterministic one. As satellite orbits are pre- known in the space region, we introduce a deterministic time-space subgraph. While each aircraft has a cyclic movement with the predictable contact probability and contact time in the air region, we construct a semi-deterministic time-space subgraph according to the prediction results of a discrete time homogeneous semi-Markov model. Simulation results show that HGHR has good performance in terms of data delivery ratio and end- to-end delay.	algorithm;communications satellite;dtime;end-to-end encryption;interaction;markov chain;markov model;routing;semiconductor industry;simulation;telecommunications network;vii	Weigang Hou;Qingyang Song;Lei Guo;Yue Zong;Abbas Jamalipour	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417677	atmospheric model;routing;static routing;simulation;hierarchical routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;predictive modelling;markov process;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;statistics;computer network	Theory	3.7329092448685284	85.7849521491842	167481

However, the ever increasing set of demands posed by these applications is stretching the 802.11 MAC protocol beyond its intended capabilities. For example, 802.11 provides no control over allocation of resources, and the default allocation policy is ill-suited for heterogeneous environments and multi-hop networks. Fairness problems are further exacerbated in multi-hop networks due to link asymmetry and hidden terminals. In this paper, we take a first step towards addressing these problems without replacing the MAC layer by presenting the design and the implementation of an Overlay MAC Layer (OML), that works on top of the 802.11 MAC layer. OML uses loosely-synchronized clocks to divide the time in to equal size slots, and employs a distributed algorithm to allocate these slots among competing nodes. We have implemented OML in both a simulator and on a wireless testbed using the Click modular router. Our evaluation shows that OML can not only provide better flexibility but also improve the fairness, throughput and predictability of 802.11 networks.	bandwidth management;distributed algorithm;fairness measure;oml;overhead (computing);overlay network;router (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;smart environment;testbed;throughput	Ananth Rao;Ion Stoica	2005		10.1145/1067170.1067185	embedded system;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile device;computer network	Mobile	7.492953280924272	88.35184743645802	167913

In this paper, we propose a delay-sensitive vehicular routing protocol, which uses the intersections as anchors to establish optimal delay routing paths consisting of a list of intersections. The main feature of our protocol is the periodic estimation of the road segment delay expressed in the combination of average delay and delay variance using multi-hop vehicle relaying. As this estimation is local to road segments, we make use of ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) concept to discover end-to-end best delay paths from source to target intersection which is closest to the destination. Route setup process is achieved by reactive forward ants and backward ants, which are in charge of network exploration and pheromone dissemination respectively. Routing selection is implemented at each intersection to opportunistically choose best next intersection based on a pheromone routing table. A proactive route maintenance is initiated by source to update, expand and improve the routing information during data transmission period using periodic proactive ants sampling. In addition, we make use of simple carry and/or greedy forwarding technique to relay packets between adjacent intersections. The simulation results indicate that our protocol shows better communication performance compared with a basic geographical routing protocol (GPSR) and a min-delay routing protocol (CAR) in regard to delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and overhead.	ant colony optimization algorithms;channel capacity;end-to-end principle;geographic routing;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);multistage interconnection networks;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);proactive parallel suite;relay;routing table;sampling (signal processing);scalability;simulation	Guangyu Li;Lila Boukhatem	2013	2013 12th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (MED-HOC-NET)	10.1109/MedHocNet.2013.6767409	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;engineering;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.460008621327133	83.80543863695523	168182

The focus is on optimizing tradeoffs between the energy cost of spreading traffic and the improved spatial balance of energy burdens. We propose a simple scheme for multipath routing based on spatial relationships among nodes. Then, combining stochastic geometric and queueing models, we develop a continuum model for such networks, permitting an evaluation of different types of scenarios, i.e., with and without energy replenishing and storage capabilities. We propose a parameterized family of energy balancing strategies and study the spatial distributions of energy burdens based on their associated second-order statistics. Our analysis and simulations show the fundamental importance of the tradeoff explored in this paper, and how its optimization depends on the relative values of the energy reserves/storage, replenishing rates, and network load characteristics. For example, one of our results shows that the degree of spreading should roughly scale as the square root of the bits ċ meters load offered by a session. Simulation results confirm that proactive multipath routing decreases the probability of energy depletion by orders of magnitude versus that of a shortest path routing scheme when the initial energy reserve is high.	multipath routing	Seung Jun Baek;Gustavo de Veciana	2007	IEEE/ACM Trans.

During inter-vehicle communications, it is essential that emergency information be broadcast to surrounding vehicles. Emergency information such as emergency-vehicle-approach information and traffic accident information are needed by vehicles in a particular area. By limiting the broadcast direction, the proposed methods can provide broadcasts to a particular area and avoid mistakenly notifying other areas where the information is not needed. We developed a simulation and experimental system for the proposed method and confirmed that the information is broadcast to the desired area.	experimental system;simulation;vehicle information and communication system	Tadayuki Fukuhara;Takayuki Warabino;Takeo Ohseki;Kenji Saito;Keizo Sugiyama;Tomohiro Nishida;Kazuo Eguchi	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424866	wireless ad hoc network;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;global broadcast service;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer security;broadcasting;web server;computer network	Robotics	3.4818585325256266	87.94898456303481	168430

Constructing a mobile backbone can effectively improve the packet delivery performance of a mobile opportunistic network by excluding poor relay nodes and reducing packet collisions. However, it is highly challenging to construct an effective mobile backbone because of the absence of the quantitative relationship between the network performance and the selection of backbone nodes, and expositive search space. As nodes exhibit clear sociality observed in previous studies, We explicitly take such node sociality into account when computing the backbone for mobile opportunistic networks and we incrementally propose three algorithms for computing the mobile backbone. Trace-driven simulations have been conducted and simulation results demonstrate that the sociality-aware algorithms can achieve low delivery delay and high delivery ratio.	apollonian network;entity–relationship model;greedy algorithm;i/o request packet;internet backbone;network packet;network performance;relay;simulation;tracing (software)	Tong Liu;Yanmin Zhu;Ruobing Jiang;Bo Li	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831102	time complexity;algorithm design;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;backbone network;distributed computing;cluster analysis;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	2.8446127703977107	83.44322379344162	168493

However, most existing path planning schemes fail to cope with the challenges in post-disaster map environment due to its increased complexity and uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Random Walk based path Planner (HRWP). In HRWP, Regular Grid and Voronoi Diagram are used to model the map, and uncertain map segments are assigned uncertain cost using random variables. The hierarchical random walk is then designed to generate the optimal path using probabilistic accept-reject. In this way, results of HRWP can significantly reduce the risk of uncertainty and converge to the optimal path. Using a combination of analytical modeling and extensive simulations we show that HRWP outperforms existing path planer and mobility schemes, and performs well in complicated environments.	android;converge;hoc (programming language);mobile device;motion planning;regular grid;relay;simulation;voronoi diagram;ios	Xinyu Yang;Chaoxin Hu;Manli Fan;Benyuan Liu	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554703	disaster;simulation;mobile ad hoc network;any-angle path planning;computational geometry;computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;motion planning	Robotics	4.417227690940136	85.50924717562461	168906

We propose Time-Split, a very simple and distributed scheduling algorithm compatible with the conventional EDCA mode of access. Time-Split is equipped with a simple mechanism to remove off-path interference without knowledge of the interference graph. Furthermore, Time-Split limits time-line fragmentation by creating contiguous inactivity periods within a beacon interval that can be used for deep power saving. We compare the performance of Time-Split with a greedy scheduler which performs optimally over the tree formed by HWMP for traffic routed to/from the gateway. We show that Time-Split can achieve more than 90 % optimal throughput at a packet delivery ratio of almost 100 %. More importantly, we propose split-depth as a means to strike a balance between interference elimination and spectrum sharing. In addition, we introduce a multi-channel version of Time-Split improving connection acceptance ratio by about 15 % using a single radio interface. Furthermore, due to its contiguous deep sleep intervals, Time-Split can potentially provide up to 25 and 50 % energy savings compared to conventional EDCA with sleep capability and a greedy sleep scheduler, respectively.	scheduling (computing)	Mojtaba MalekpourShahraki;Hadi Barghi;Seyed Vahid Azhari;Saeed Asaiyan	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3347-0	real-time computing;telecommunications;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	8.661780285778159	87.0014812235593	169176

The Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) produced by Primary Users (PUs) on collocated Cognitive Users (CUs) along with Expected Transmission Time (ETT) among CUs is taken into account for cluster formation. The primary concern of the proposed work is to find a suitable method of cluster formation for efficient routing in CRAHN. The suggested algorithm is simulated in ns-3 . Through the observed results, values of some base parameters for efficient clustering are established.

What is even more, they have also shown that the range of a unidirectional link can exceed that of a bidirectional one by far. Still, most of todays routing protocols do not use them, they only eliminate their implications. Those protocols that do use unidirectional links introduce a lot of protocol overhead. In this paper we present Buckshot Routing, a robust, yet simple source routing protocol for dense wireless networks with lossy or unidirectional links, which reduces the overhead generated by route discovery and route maintenance significantly.	ansi escape code;distance-vector routing protocol;experiment;hyperlink;lossy compression;overhead (computing);simulation;source routing	David Peters;Reinhardt Karnapke;Jörg Nolte	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11723-7_18	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;wireless sensor network;supernetwork;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.842504877658504	82.46919446967709	170053
8b9090187125a9300bc36644879ac62f374b9529	simulating the effect of degraded wireless communications on emergent behavior		Most swarming algorithms require individual nodes to know the locations of their nearest-neighbor peers. Existing work assumes that this information is abundant and readily available, however, when wireless communications are used for data exchange, issues regarding dissemination arise. These include partial or complete data loss and an increased latency, significantly affecting the quality of the delivered service. In this paper, we show through extensive experimental analysis that swarm intelligent algorithms are vulnerable to degraded communication. To show how communication is affected in a contested environment, we introduce a local interaction statistic metric to capture emergence. Our analysis using agent-based simulation characterizes the decay of inherent emergence and swarm efficiency with increasing data loss and delay.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;algorithm;autocorrelation;coefficient;emergence;lossless compression;mesh networking;nearest-neighbor interpolation;network topology;quality of service;randomness;resultant;swarm;time series	Bradley Fraser;Robert Hunjet;Claudia Szabo	2017	2017 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)	10.1109/WSC.2017.8248117	swarm behaviour;simulation;computer science;latency (engineering);wireless;statistic;data exchange;data loss;algorithm design;distributed computing;swarming (honey bee)	Mobile	5.074042179955948	84.06712804525405	170180
558044d667f0f8ed9e86146c4703a7062d9df8c2	merging of dht-based logical networks in manets		We study the challenging problem of the network partitioning and merging in context with the mismatch problem and the resilience of the logical structure in distributed hash table (DHT)-based routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The existing DHT-based approaches for routing in MANETs do not consider the merging of logical networks, which occurs because of limited transmission range and mobility of nodes. In this paper, we identify that the mismatch problem is aggravated when logical networks are merged, which directly depends upon the shape of the logical structure in which nodes are arranged according to their logical identifier. To address this problem, we first propose a leader-based approach (LA) to detect and merge logical networks. In addition, we discuss the effectiveness of a three-dimensional logical space and three-dimensional logical structure when logical networks are merged. In three-dimensional logical space and three-dimensional logical structure, we take into account the physical intra-neighbour relationship of a node and interpret that relationship in terms of logical identifiers. Simulation results show that the proposed DHT-based protocol along with LA outperforms the existing DHT-based routing protocol in terms routing overhead, end-to-end delay, path-stretch values and packet delivery ratio.

54cc67d27edfb2ead8d0b29e71d11f2fcd42ea93	transient data delivery using fine-grained mobility data in spontaneous smartphone networks	markov predictor;mobility data;delay tolerant networks;overhead optimal	The commercial success of smartphones increases the feasibility of mobile ad hoc networking in daily life; we define such networks as spontaneous smartphone networks SSNs. Efficient data delivery in SSNs is challenging because of the low node density, ambiguous contact opportunities, and short message lifetime. The existing schemes attempt to select optimal relays via various cumulative metrics e.g., encounter history, social centrality, or contact distribution, whose effectiveness is ambiguous and suboptimal. In this paper, we introduce a Markov predictor-based transient delivery scheme that quantifies the regularity of small time scale movement for forwarding decisions. Unlike previous works, we utilized fine-grained mobility data to reduce errors of estimating contact opportunities and contact duration. On the basis of this forwarding strategy, we developed a multi-copy routing scheme. The evaluation using real traces indicates that the proposed approach outperforms compared alternatives in terms of delivery rate and cost.

9a70528a3bb685f5fe5f9a6ed9053d734e8ac12c	energy-efficient routing protocol based on probability in dtsn		Energy supply of nodes in a Delay Tolerant Sensor Network (DTSN) usually relies on batteries, and the energy consumption unbalance caused by complicated topology and intermittent communication links has been becoming an issue for routing protocol design. DTSN achieves opportunistic communications using the mobility of nodes, where nodes deliver messages by the mechanism of Storage-Carry-Forward. This paper proposes an Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol based on Probability in DTSN (a.b. EERPP), where each sensor node takes a number of neighbors as the node list of its potential receiver set. A node makes its routing decision according to the metric of the average energy consumption for a message arriving at the destination node, which is modeled based on the probability of a message successfully delivered from the source node to the destination node or dropped before arriving at the destination node. Simulation results and discussions show that EERPP algorithm achieves satisfactory energy efficiency, as well as acceptable delay in a large scale network, compared with some traditional protocols.	routing	Xiong Tang;Dan Sha;Yixiong Bian;Haiping Huang;Min Wu	2017		10.1007/978-981-10-8123-1_9	wireless sensor network;energy supply;computer network;energy consumption;efficient energy use;routing protocol;sensor node;computer science	EDA	7.693286879556003	81.81842046097951	171430
067715fb13a3d6398ab03c43ff0e388db560aff9	a review of routing protocols of underwater acoustic sensor networks from application perspective	routing protocol strategies;underwater acoustic sensor networks;application scenarios	Underwater acoustic communications are different from terrestrial radio communications in terms of limited acoustic channel capacity, long propagation delay and highly dynamic and asymmetrical underwater acoustic underwater channel as well as high transmission and reception power consumption of sensor nodes. These peculiar features make routing in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) quite different from that in terrestrial wireless networks. In this case, it is impossible to design just one or two routing protocols that can cost-effectively support all underwater application scenarios, and an optimal design must take into account each different favorable feature available in different scenarios to maximize routing performance, especially the characteristics of various network topologies. Therefore, in this paper, we review some typical routing protocols proposed for UASNs from application perspectives in terms of the adopted routing strategies and the feasibility of the proposed routing schemes, which is different from the existing reviews that are conducted mainly following the taxonomy for terrestrial wireless sensor networks.	acoustic cryptanalysis;channel capacity;network topology;optimal design;propagation delay;routing;software propagation;terrestrial television	Lu Qian;Shengming Jiang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems (ICCS)	10.1109/ICCS.2016.7833633	wireless routing protocol;routing domain;routing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	8.695683437241208	86.19653679524708	171500

The proposed protocol (named as EQ-MAC) consists of two sub-protocols: Classifier MAC (C-MAC), and Channel Access MAC (CA-MAC). C-MAC is responsible of classifying gathered data at sensor nodes based on its importance and then stores it in the appropriate queue of the node's queuing system. The CA-MAC is an energy efficient medium access mechanism that uses a hybrid approach of both scheduled and unscheduled schemes to gain a save in energy, and hence prolonging the network's lifetime. The save in energy achieved by CA-MAC is coming from the differentiation between control and data messages. Data messages are assigned scheduled slots with no contention (here we have to emphasize that slots are assigned only to those nodes which have data to send, this allows an efficient energy use of the TDMA slots), while short periodic control messages are assigned random access slots. To study the performance of the EQ-MAC protocol, several simulation experiments were conducted. EQ-MAC is compared with both Q-MAC and S-MAC protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that EQ-MAC outperforms the other two protocols and achieves a significant improvement in terms of energy expenditure. Under prioritized traffic, EQ-MAC is comparable to Q-MAC in average latency, while achieving less energy consumption.	access control;c-mac;cluster analysis;data redundancy;experiment;mac address;quality of service;random access;relational operator;self-organized criticality;sensor node;simulation;sleep mode	Bashir Yahya;Jalel Ben-Othman	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.31	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.126082543904259	82.93389778569804	171637

In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm which performs fair and periodic data collection from all energy harvesting sensor nodes. The goal of the proposed algorithm is to collect data effectively in the situation where the prediction accuracy of recharging profiles is low. In the proposed algorithm, tasks of sensing, reception and transmission for a sensor node are prioritized and scheduled according to the amount of harvested energy of the node. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by computer simulation. As for performance measures, we consider the average number of packets sent to the sink node per cycle for a node, the fairness index in terms of the node position. and the average transmission delay. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm increases the average number of packets sent to the sink node while it never degrades fairness index and the average transmission delay as compared with a conventional scheme especially when the amount of harvested energy is large.	algorithm;computer simulation;fairness measure;numerical method;scheduling (computing);sensor node	Akifumi Maeda;Shoji Kasahara;Yutaka Takahashi	2016		10.1145/3016032.3016054	real-time computing;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	9.575807343858493	82.21963205480434	172559

However, the intermittent connectivity nature of DTNs makes energy-efficient contact discovery a tough challenge. To save energy, a node should work in low-power mode most of the time since contacts with the other nodes may rarely happen. However, such a strategy will probably fail to detect many contacts with relatively short durations, leading to system performance degradation. In this paper, we consider a specific type of DTN, i.e., the pocket switched networks (PSN), in which the nodes' mobility pattern shows a strong social property. In a PSN, although the end-to-end path may be disconnected for the majority of time, several nodes periodically gather at certain hot spots and form well-connected clusters. Based on such mobility pattern, cooperation among nodes is utilized in our contact discovery design. The nodes that have already joined a cluster collaboratively wake up to discover new contacts. With local synchronization and complementary consideration of possible traffic congestion, both the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our cooperative duty cycling (CDC) greatly reduces the energy consumption while achieving comparable data delivery performance.	computer cluster;delay-tolerant networking;duty cycle;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;information exchange;low-power broadcasting;network congestion;power supply;routing;simulation	Shengbo Yang;Chai Kiat Yeo;Bu-Sung Lee	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2227865	synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	6.547301152505213	82.2239897725511	172640

At present, vehicular networks are still not considered to be very efficient because of their rapid topology changes and their highly dynamic structure. However, there has been ongoing and progressive research and development in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) [1] [2] [3] to support vehicle to vehicle communication, particularly in the area of routing in VANETs. In VANETs, routing schemes to reduced overhead and resource consumption is required to ensure successful message transfer within the network. The routing protocol proposed in this paper is based on a multi-hop transfer of a single message by discovering the most suitable vehicle within the transmission range instead of using single hop broadcast (flooding) scheme which results in high packet loss and collision rate. The simulation environment used for proposed algorithm is a tool which combines both network simulator and traffic simulator, known as NCTUns-6.0.	algorithm;elegant degradation;emulator;fastest;hoc (programming language);international standard serial number;john d. wiley;mobile computing;network packet;overhead (computing);protocol stack;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;velocity (software development);weitao yang	Muhammad Bilal;Pauline M.

2b041d29d5855d9b89833818eaabb45fcd53b5c1	evaluation of energy and buffer aware application mapping for networks-on-chip	noc simulation;application mapping;buffer utilization;self similar traffic	Networks-on-Chip (NoC) is a communication paradigm for Systems-on-Chip (SoC). NoC design flow contains many problems, one of which is called as application mapping problem, which is generally solved in the literature by considering minimization of the communication energy consumption only. Energy and Buffer Aware Application Mapping (EBAM) is a recently proposed method, which handles the application mapping issue as a joint optimization problem for minimizing the energy consumption and buffer utilization simultaneously. EBAM avoids possible high input loads on router buffers at the early mapping stage by using a priori traffic characteristics of the application. Self similarity is already an accepted model in local and wide area networks and many on-chip applications have also been proven to have self similar characteristics. EBAM therefore employs self similar traffic in its joint optimization process and a genetic algorithm is already proposed for its solution. This paper presents a simulation study that evaluates EBAM in terms of network parameters such as buffer utilization and end-to-end delay. For this, a self-similar traffic generator module is implemented first on a well known NoC simulator and then buffer utilization of routers and end-to-end delay under self similar traffic are observed. Simulation results show that the method enhances buffer utilization and end-to-end delay against a reasonable energy trade off. A routing protocol selection task follows the mapping stage in a typical NoC design flow hence our paper also presents a computational study that evaluates the effect of EBAM use on commonly encountered on-chip routing algorithms. Results reveal that simple XY routing protocol, compared to others, performs better on mappings obtained by EBAM, which indicates that the need for complicated routing protocols may be eliminated. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, it proposes the ad hoc network routing which considers both of power consumption and the amount of the battery remainder. To improve the availability of ad hoc networks, routing which considers both at the same time is needed though power consumption and the amount of the battery remainder have been separately examined in the research so far. We propose BPA-DSR (Battery and Power Aware enhancement to Dynamic Source Routing) which searches for the route by the flooding of two times. The path with large amount of the battery remainder is detected by the first flooding, and the location of the neighboring nodes of the route is computed from the received radio power at the same time. Each link of the route is divided into the power saving link and tuned up by the flooding of the second. Simulation results show that the amount of the battery remainder of the proposed method is better than other method (LP-DSR) which is aware of the power consumption. Power consumption of the proposed method is better than that of DSR though it is a little inferior to LP-DSR which detects the route of minimum power consumption. The number of hops of the detected route is suppressed to about 60% of LP-DSR.

202dce9932cb662afe48918e417191b6b9950f6d	on the tradeoff between altruism and selfishness in manet trust management	demand and pricing theory;trust management;selfishness;mobile ad hoc networks;altruism	Mobile ad hoc and sensor networks may consist of a mixture of nodes, some of which may be considered selfish due to a lack of cooperativeness in providing network services such as forwarding packets. In the literature, existing trust management protocols for mobile ad hoc networks advocate isolating selfish nodes as soon as they are detected. Further, altruistic behaviors are encouraged with incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we propose and analyze a trust management protocol for group communication systems where selfish nodes exist and system survivability is highly critical to mission execution. Rather than always encouraging altruistic behaviors, we consider the tradeoff between a node’s individual welfare (e.g., saving energy to prolong the node lifetime) vs. global welfare (e.g., achieving a given mission with sufficient service availability) and identify the best design condition of this behavior model to balance selfish vs. altruistic behaviors. With the system lifetime and the mission success probability as our trust-based reliability metric, we show that our behavior model that exploits the tradeoff between selfishness vs. altruism outperforms one that only encourages altruistic behaviors.

Hence, providing reliable and timely data delivery in this network in an energy-efficient way is challenging. Although there exist several solutions to solve these problems, they can handle either route failure or congestion or energy-efficient routing. Hence, to cope up with all the problems simultaneously, we propose a route failure and congestion-aware energy-efficient cross-layer design that spans the transport and network layer. In the transport layer, we introduce the concept of local packet buffering during link failure and congestion. As a result, the packet dropping rate of the network and energy consumption decreases. In the network layer, a routing protocol is proposed for selecting the energy-efficient path for data transmission. It uses the buffering mechanism in case of route maintenance. In addition, we employ a multilevel congestion detection and control mechanism at the source and intermediate nodes that can judiciously take the most appropriate decision for congestion control in the network proactively. The simulation results showed that the proposed cross-layer design provided better performance as compared with the state-of-the-art protocols.

This work studies power-aware routing so as to maximize the minimum remaining energy of all nodes after routing. This routing metric, referred to as Maximum-Residual Routing, aims at maintaining the minimum remaining energy as high as possible so as to delay the fist failure time of nodes in the network. In this paper, a polynomial-time optimal algorithm is proposed for Maximum-Residual Multicasting. We then show that Maximum-Residual Aggregating is $${\mathcal{NP}}$$ -hard and that, unless $${\mathcal{P = NP}},$$ its minimization version cannot be approximated within a ratio better than (2 ? ?) for any ? > 0. The proposed routing algorithm for Maximum-Residual Multicasting can be applied to existing routing protocols, especially those based on the link-state approach. The capability of the algorithm was evaluated by a series of experiments, for which we have very encouraging results in network lifetime and load balance.	hoc (programming language);multicast	Pi-Cheng Hsiu;Chin-Hsien Wu;Tei-Wei Kuo	2010	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-009-0163-4	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.31156466268538	82.38206731600765	173460

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.	central processing unit;computer science;computer simulation;decision table;depletion region;energy level;function overloading;hoc (programming language);information security;intrusion detection system;mobile device;online and offline;real-time clock;response time (technology)	Massimiliano Raciti;Jordi Cucurull-Juan;Simin Nadjm-Tehrani	2011	2011 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2011.6098216	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;engineering;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.4681722576199885	84.88586008558224	173867

In contrast to single-cost routing, where each path is characterized by a scalar, in multicost routing a vector of cost parameters is assigned to each link, from which the cost vectors of the paths are calculated. These parameters are combined according to an optimization function for selecting the optimal path. Up until now the performance of multicost routing in ad hoc networks has been evaluated either at a theoretical level or by assuming that nodes are static and have full knowledge of the network topology and nodes' state. In the present paper we assess the performance of multicost routing, based on energy-related parameters, in mobile ad hoc networks by embedding its logic in the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) algorithm, which is a well-known distributed routing algorithm. We compare the performance of the multicost-DSR algorithm to that of the original DSR algorithm under various node mobility scenarios. The results confirm that the multicost-DSR algorithm improves the performance of the network in comparison to the original DSR, by reducing energy consumption overall in the network, spreading energy consumption more uniformly across the network, and reducing the packet drop probability and delivery delay.	ansi escape code;algorithm;geforce 600 series;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;network packet;network topology;source routing	Christos A.

We analyze the performance with respect to the completion time, defined as the time for the message to reach a given portion of nodes, and the communication complexity, defined as the number of message forwarding per node. We analyze two natural flooding algorithms. First is a lazy algorithm where the message can be forwarded by a node only if it was first received by this node through a path shorter than the hop limit count. Second is a more complex protocol where each node forwards the message at a given time, if it could have been received by this node through a path shorter than the hop limit count. We derive exact asymptotics for the completion time and the communication complexity for large network size which reveal the effect of the hop limit count. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that both flooding algorithms perform near optimum and that the simpler (lazy) algorithm is only slightly worse than the other, more complicated algorithm. The results provide insights into performance of networked systems that use hop limits, for example, in the contexts of peer-to-peer systems and mobile ad-hoc networks.	algorithm;communication complexity;hoc (programming language);hop;lazy evaluation;peer-to-peer;time to live	Milan Vojnovic;Alexandre Proutière	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935249	wireless ad hoc network;algorithm design;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;markov process;mobile computing;computer network	Metrics	3.119902822705062	82.96390411472584	174958

Crelay exploits both the partial packets and the overhearing capabilities of wireless nodes, and uses an error correction code in packet forwarding. When a node overhears a partial packet from an upstream node, it estimates the number of errors in the packet and informs the upstream node. The upstream node calculates the number of parity bytes required to correct the errors and can usually send only a small amount parity bytes instead of sending the complete packet, hence improving the network efficiency. We propose a novel protocol for packet forwarding with partial packets and overhearing, which forwards individual packets and will work seamlessly with upper layers. We also propose a practical algorithm for finding the packet forwarding path. We implement Crelay within the Click modular router and our experiments show that it can significantly improve the performance of wireless networks.	algorithm;byte;error detection and correction;experiment;institute for operations research and the management sciences;network packet;relay;router (computing)	Zhenghao Zhang;Wei Hu;Jin Xie	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6504021	packet drop attack;ratio estimator;communications protocol;ring network;link state packet;greedy algorithm;wireless wan;packet analyzer;fast packet switching;network packet;packet generator;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;wireless network;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;packet forwarding;forward error correction;transmission delay;wi-fi array;packet loss;packet switch;burst switching;statistics;computer network	Mobile	6.669319720700445	86.71561657880258	175006

These simulations necessarily abstract away from reality in many ways. However, the impact of these abstractions on the results of the simulations has received only limited attention. Moreover, many studies on the accuracy of simulation have studied either the physical layer and per link effects or routing protocol effects. To the best of our knowledge, no other work has focused on the study of the simulation abstractions with respect to MAC protocol performance. In this paper we present the results of an experimental study of two often used abstractions in the simulation of WSN MAC protocols. We show that a simple SNRbased reception model can provide quite accurate results for metrics commonly used to evaluate MAC protocols. Furthermore we provide an analysis of what the main sources of deviation are and thereby how the simulations can be improved to provide even better results.	b-mac;experiment;network packet;quantum fluctuation;routing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;testbed;unit disk graph	Gertjan P.

It allows inter-vehicle communication in which their movement is restricted by a VANET mobility model and supported by some roadside base stations as fixed infrastructures. Multicasting provides different traffic information to a limited number of vehicle drivers by a parallel transmission. However, it represents a very important challenge in the application of vehicular ad hoc networks especially, in the case of the network scalability. In the applications of this sensitive field, it is very essential to transmit correct data anywhere and at any time. Consequently, the VANET routing protocols should be adapted appropriately and meet effectively the quality of service (QoS) requirements in an optimized multicast routing. In this paper, we propose a novel bee colony optimization algorithm called bees life algorithm (BLA) applied to solve the quality of service multicast routing problem (QoS-MRP) for vehicular ad hoc networks as NP-Complete problem with multiple constraints. It is considered as swarm-based algorithm which imitates closely the life of the colony. It follows the two important behaviors in the nature of bees which are the reproduction and the food foraging. BLA is applied to solve QoS-MRP with four objectives which are cost, delay, jitter, and bandwidth. It is also submitted to three constraints which are maximum allowed delay, maximum allowed jitter and minimum requested bandwidth. In order to evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of this realized proposal using C++ and integrated at the routing protocol level, a simulation study has been performed using the network simulator (NS2) based on a mobility model of VANET. The comparisons of the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperformed in an efficient way genetic algorithm (GA), bees algorithm (BA) and marriage in honey bees optimization (MBO) algorithm as state-of-the-art conventional metaheuristics applied to QoS-MRP problem with the same simulation parameters.

The results are analyzed and compared with the well-known Reference Broadcast Synchronization (RBS) protocol. The results show that CTS has better performance than RBS in high traffic flow scenarios.	algorithm;carpal tunnel syndrome;distributed computing;hoc (programming language);jam;network packet;scalability;simulation;software propagation;synchronization (computer science);whole earth 'lectronic link	Shizhun Wang;Anjum Pervez;Maziar Nekovee	2010	2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)		synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	4.676903370717719	86.66438552632793	175753

However, medium access control (MAC) layer requirements for communications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) vary because the network is usually optimized for specific applications. Thus, one particular standard will hardly be suitable for every possible application. Two general categories of MAC techniques exist: contention based and schedule based. This paper explains these two main approaches and includes examples of each one. The paper concludes with a unique performance analysis and comparison of benefits and limitations of each protocol with respect to WSNs.	access control;communications protocol;network topology;performance evaluation;requirement;schedule (computer science);sensor web;software deployment;transmitter	Joseph Kabara;Maria Calle	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/834784	telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Embedded	9.557960796906846	85.85745044791693	176199

Therefore, the willingness of nodes to relay messages for other nodes plays a significant role in the routing process. Moreover, since the resources in mobile devices are generally limited, carriers of mobile devices may be unwilling to relay messages for other nodes in order to conserve their scarce resources. Furthermore, recent studies on the impact of selfish behavior in DTNs show that the performance metrics (i.e., delivery ratio, delivery overhead, and delivery latency) are severely influenced if a major portion of the nodes is selfish. A number of strategies have been proposed to prevent the impact of selfish behavior. It is therefore necessary to give an overview of the representative strategies. In this paper, we first classify the different types of selfish behavior. The existing strategies for preventing selfish behavior are traditionally classified into three categories: barter-based, credit-based and reputation-based. We then survey some representative strategies in the literature belonging to each category. Finally, we conduct experiments to compare the performance of these strategies for preventing different types of selfish behavior.	experiment;mobile device;overhead (computing);relay;routing	Jingwei Miao;Omar Hasan;Sonia Ben Mokhtar;Lionel Brunie;Kangbin Yim	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2012.121	ecash;game theory;routing;mobile telephony;reputation;resource allocation;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	4.433803001496197	82.04775095080122	176506

Asynchronous MAC protocols are widely used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). An important drawback of these protocols is the sleep-delay phenomenon, which may impose high communication latency. In order to tackle this shortcoming, the concept of anycast, i.e., to explore opportunistic path redundancy is employed, instead of selecting a unique next hop. Existing approaches employ arbitrary rules to select the possible next relays. The mathematical model introduced in this work enables a better selection of next hop candidates based on packet size and network density, in order to minimize the sleep-delay. Along with the model, experimental results are presented validating the proposal.	access control;anycast;mathematical model;network packet;relay	Tales Heimfarth;João Carlos Giacomin;João Paulo de Araujo;Edison Pignaton de Freitas	2016		10.1145/2851613.2851856	anycast;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.251250605170478	82.77002008029835	176576

Some of the algorithms focus on setting up an event path and the nodes get the information by sending the queries to the event path. On the other hand some algorithms flood the event information from source node to its neighbors and from neighbors to the neighbors of neighbors and so on. The first type involves extra delay, and the second type consumes more power. In this paper we introduce a new protocol ‘MERCC’ which can handle multiple events at a single instance with power effective methodology. MERCC tries to retain the performance even in case of network congestion.

Although multicast routing algorithms could be efficient in many situations but their routing mechanism like as route request flooding packets likely results in poor performance in comparison to unicast routing algorithms. In this research, two efficient methods are proposed to improve the performance of On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP). The main proposed method tries to establish a small, efficient, and high-quality forwarding group. This is achieved by augmenting the Join Query packets with additional information such as speed, power level of node, and link bandwidths. Besides, the control overhead is further reduced by restricting the domain of control packet flooding (by restricting the domain of control packet flooding). The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme increases the packet delivery rate by up to 40%, while reducing average end-to-end delay and consumed power by about 35% and 45%, respectively.

869aa114a5fbff8caef29aab3acb17b69d5c1faf	on designing lightweight qos routing protocol for delay-sensitive wireless body area networks		Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning is critical and mandatory in any Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). Routing protocols for this kind of networks need to be very efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be developed as WBANs are wireless interconnection of resource constrained miniaturized sensors either implanted or worn in/on the body. Optimization of Delay QoS parameter is very important requirement of many WBAN applications, particularly those demanding real-time data delivery service. In this paper, a lightweight routing protocol called LRPD is proposed, which operates hop-by-hop to optimize end-to-end latency. The protocol is realized, and evaluated for performance comparison against existing protocols of same category. Comparative study demonstrates satisfactory performance improvements.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;hop-by-hop transport;interconnection;interrupt latency;low-power broadcasting;network topology;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time data;routing;sensor;simulation	M.

The lack of robust and efficient paradigms causes a reduction in the provision of quality of service (QoS) and additional energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce modular energy-efficient and robust paradigms that involve two archetypes: (1) the operational medium access control (O-MAC) hybrid protocol and (2) the pheromone termite (PT) model. The O-MAC protocol controls overhearing and congestion and increases the throughput, reduces the latency and extends the network lifetime. O-MAC uses an optimized data frame format that reduces the channel access time and provides faster data delivery over the medium. Furthermore, O-MAC uses a novel randomization function that avoids channel collisions. The PT model provides robust routing for single and multiple links and includes two new significant features: (1) determining the packet generation rate to avoid congestion and (2) pheromone sensitivity to determine the link capacity prior to sending the packets on each link. The state-of-the-art research in this work is based on improving both the QoS and energy efficiency. To determine the strength of O-MAC with the PT model; we have generated and simulated a disaster recovery scenario using a network simulator (ns-3.10) that monitors the activities of disaster recovery staff; hospital staff and disaster victims brought into the hospital. Moreover; the proposed paradigm can be used for general purpose applications. Finally; the QoS metrics of the O-MAC and PT paradigms are evaluated and compared with other known hybrid protocols involving the MAC and routing features. The simulation results indicate that O-MAC with PT produced better outcomes.	access control;access time;algorithm;anycast;departure - action;disaster recovery;duty cycle;frame (networking);hearing loss, high-frequency;isoptera;macrophage-1 antigen;marginal model;network congestion;network packet;neural network simulation;node - plant part;operand forwarding;pro tools;programming paradigm;protocols documentation;provisioning;quality of service;randomization function;retry;routing;semiconductor industry;termite-inspired robots;throughput;ubuntu;collision;pheromone biosynthetic process	Abdul Razaque;Khaled M.

6c21685469f421373938efb46273215015e2d8fd	performance analysis of reliable flooding in duty-cycle wireless sensor networks		Wireless sensor network WSN is an emerging technology widely applied in modern applications. The resource limitations and the peculiarity of broadcast communication have made traditional flooding methods suffering severe performance degradation if directly applied to duty-cycle WSNs in which each node auto-activates for a brief interval and stays dormant most of time. In this work, a theoretical performance analysis of acknowledgement ACK-based and non-acknowledgement NoACK-based transmission mechanisms is presented. The evaluation considers both a point-to-point model and a point-to-multipoint one. Furthermore, the opportunistic flooding algorithm, which considers the effects of both duty cycle and unreliable wireless links of WSN, is implemented and evaluated considering both the ACK-based and NoACK-based transmission mechanisms. A solid framework is proposed in order to optimise the flooding in duty-cycle WSNs according to the network requirements. Extensive simulations show that ACK-based and NoACK-based implementations produce a similar performance on the flooding delay, but with significantly different costs on the energy consumption.

In this paper, we address the problem of energy efficient reliable routing for wireless ad hoc networks in the presence of unreliable communication links or devices or lossy wireless link layers by integrating the power control techniques into the energy efficient routing. We consider both the case when the link layer implements a perfect reliability and the case when the reliability is implemented through the transport layer, e.g., TCP. We study the energy efficient unicast and multicast when the links are unreliable. Subsequently, we study how to perform power control (thus, controlling the reliability of each communication link) such that the unicast routings use the least power when the communication links are unreliable, while the power used by multicast is close to optimum. Extensive simulations have been conducted to study the power consumption, the end-to-end delay, and the network throughput of our proposed protocols compared with existing protocols.	end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);lossy compression;multicast;multipath routing;one-to-one (data model);simulation;throughput;unicast	Xiang-Yang Li;Yu Wang;Haiming Chen;Xiaowen Chu;Yanwei Wu;Yong Qi	2009	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2008.248	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;efficient energy use;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	8.602838664348871	85.61590909872852	178072

In DTNs, the mobile nodes are disconnected for significantly long periods of time. As a result, traditional routing protocols proposed for MANETs, which assume at least one steady path between pairs of source and destination nodes, are ineffective in DTNs. One approach to improve communication in DTNs is through gossip based protocols because these protocols do not rely on a fixed path. However, this approach suffers from poor delivery performance as it is dependent on opportunistic communication. Another approach is to control the movement of the mobile nodes and/or use special mobile nodes called ferry nodes. However, in some practical applications it is not possible to force the mobile nodes to change their trajectory and therefore it is desirable to have a more easily deployable and scalable protocol which does not depend on changing the trajectory of mobile nodes. In this thesis, we first review important challenges of DTNs and survey the existing applications of this domain. Furthermore, we provide a taxonomy of existing DTN routing protocols and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in the context of their assumptions and applicability in DTN applications. We propose a novel routing protocol called Tag Based Routing (TBR) for DTNs which overcomes some of the limitations of existing DTN routing protocols. In TBR, the forwarding opportunities are increased by augmenting the DTNs with easily deployable and independent stationary relay nodes. Specifically, we propose an approach where mobile nodes deposit/retrieve messages to/from known stationary passive locations in the geographic region, which have no attached battery and are thereby suitable for long term usage. Messages are delivered from a source by being deposited at one or more locations that are later visited by the destination. A proposed implementation of our approach using read/writable passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, one per point location, is considered in this work. Passive RFID technology is desirable because it operates wirelessly and without the need for attached power. We have conducted a comprehensive study of the performance of our protocol using simulations as well as analytical models under many different scenarios. We also compare our protocol with state-of-the-art approaches. As part of our study we present and implement a variety of mobility models as the delivery performance of DTN routing protocols is highly dependent on the mobile nodes’ mobility models. Our evaluation results show that our protocol is fault tolerant, high performance, and scalable, while it can achieve competitive message delivery performance in comparison to existing approaches in the literature. The performance of TBR is highly dependent on the location of passive relay points. Relay placement is NP-hard problem hence it makes it a more complicated issue in DTNs. In order to improve the performance of TBR we demonstrate several techniques for optimizing the stationary relay node placement, namely relay pruning, probability based relay distribution, and a genetic algorithm based optimization and we show their effect on the performance of the proposed protocol as well as comparing their effectiveness with the existing placement techniques in the literature. Our simulation results show that an optimized relay placement technique can significantly improve the performance of TBR in both message delivery rate and average message delay. Further, we show that our genetic algorithm based optimization placement technique provides the best solutions to this problem. Additionally, we propose efficient buffer management policies to increase the performance of our proposed protocol. Mobile nodes in TBR may store the messages for a long time in their buffer until they find a contact opportunity. Long term storage accompanied by message replication needs a high buffer overhead; specifically, passive relay nodes have a more limited buffer storage than mobile nodes which intensifies the buffer overhead. Therefore, using efficient buffer policies is necessary to decide which messages should be dropped in case of overflowing. We also show that traditional buffer management policies like drop-tail or drop-front fail to consider all relevant information in this context and are, thus, sub-optimal. Our simulation results show that our buffer management policies including queuing policies and forwarding strategies significantly improve the delivery performance of TBR. The last chapters of this dissertation focus on deriving analytical expressions to model the performance of TBR. Firstly, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol and provide mathematical equations to calculate the performance of the protocol. The proposed analytical model can overcome the burden of simulation based evaluations in terms of both time and resource complexities. Secondly, we derive an analytical model that enables us to evaluate the performance of relay placement techniques in DTNs. We then use the proposed analytical model to optimize the relay placement techniques. Thereby, we propose a number of semi-heuristics approaches which utilize our model to optimize the placement. Our simulation results show that our analytical based placement approaches outperform the simulation based approaches in terms of data delivery performance.

9116f228634d5443ea96cb3fae4256aedfad5c18	on exploiting hotspot and entropy for data forwarding in delay tolerant networks		Performance of data forwarding in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) benefits considerably if one can make use of human mobility in terms of social structures. However, it is difficult and time-consuming to calculate the centrality and similarity of nodes by using solutions for traditional social networks, this is mainly because of the transient node conta ct and the intermittently connected environment. In this work, we are interested in the following question: Can we explore some ot her stable social attributes to quantify the centrality and similarity of nodes? Taking GPS traces of human walks from the real world, we find that there exist two known phenomena. One is public hotspot, the other is personal hotspot. Motivatedby this observation, we present Hoten (hotspot and entropy), a novel routing metric to improve routing performance in DTNs. First, we use the relative entropy between the public hotspo ts and the personal hotspots to compute the centrality of nodes . Then we utilize the inverse symmetrized entropy of the perso nal hotspots between two nodes to compute the similarity betwee n them. Third, we exploit the entropy of personal hotspots of a node to estimate its personality. Besides, we propose a meth od to ascertain the optimized size of hotspot. Finally, we comp are our routing strategy with other state-of-the-art routing schemes through extensive trace-driven simulations, the results s how that Hoten largely outperforms other solutions, especially in t erms of combined overhead/packet delivery ratio and the average nu mber of hops per message.	centrality;existential quantification;global positioning system;java hotspot virtual machine;kullback–leibler divergence;metrics (networking);network packet;operand forwarding;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;social network;social structure;tracing (software)	Peiyan Yuan;Huadong Ma;Shaojie Tang	2012	CoRR		theoretical computer science;data mining;distributed computing	Mobile	3.7689598745844184	85.01568006184445	178773

In this paper, we introduce a novel node caching approach for constraining the route request protocol in ad hoc routing. We have implemented node caching enhancement AODV-NC of AODV which improves the original AODV in all three metrics - extensive simulations in NS-2 show average decrease by 90% in communication overhead as well as average decrease by 63% in the delay, and average increase by 20% in the delivery ratio. We have also proposed a new measure of fairness of ad hoc routing protocols which depends on distribution of the forwarding load among nodes. The AODV-NC protocols are shown to be unfair and make certain overused nodes exhaust their batteries prematurely. We also suggest a load-balancing scheme that improves fairness and lifetime of AODV-NC, sustaining considerable improvement in overhead, delivery ratio and delay over the standard AODV.	cache (computing);fairness measure;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Sunsook Jung;Nisar Hundewale;Alex Zelikovsky	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424821	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.0587268828808565	83.18561620669395	179949

Network performance can thus vary significantly under different mobility models, as well as from the variation in parameters of a given mobility model, such as node movement speed and number of nodes in the network. Hence, the efficiency of a network depends not only on its control protocols, but also on its topology. In this paper, we first compare the impact that mobility parameter variations produces on typical network metrics - routing packets generated, routing overhead and route discovery average delay - in networks with and without topology control. Results from experiments in a wireless network simulator show that, in networks with topology control using 2 or 3 hops for route discovery depending on the node degree, the number of routing packets decreases, therefore improving the operation and efficiency of the network. Based on these results, a local adaptive self-configuration LMST topology control was then proposed and analysed, producing better results as the network size increases.	algorithm;experiment;hoc (programming language);network performance;node (computer science);overhead (computing);routing;simulation;topology control	Luciana B.

Next, we utilize the cluster stretching mechanism which decreases the leaving frequency of cluster-members. As the number of leaving events is reduced, the cluster topology is more stable for high-layer applications. Finally, an extensive performance evaluation verifies our results under different system settings.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;dominating set;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;simulation	Khac Tiep Mai;Dongkun Shin;Hyunseung Choo	2009	2009 International Conference on Information Networking		wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	DB	3.1840094645043893	82.65090379787716	180497

Therefore, in this paper we present different routing protocols for multi-sink WSNs based on the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL). Our protocols use different routing metrics and objective functions (OFs). We use the available bandwidth, delay, MAC layer queue occupancy, and expected transmission count (ETX) as the tie-breaking metrics in conjunction with the shortest hop-count metric. Our OFs use the tie-breaking metrics on a greedy or end-to-end basis. Our simulation results demonstrate that the protocols based on the delay, buffer occupancy, and ETX metrics demonstrate best performance, increasing the packet delivery ratio by up to 25% and decreasing the number of retransmissions by up to 65%, compared to a version of the RPL protocol that only uses the hop-count metric. Another key insight is that, using the tie-breaking metrics on a greedy basis demonstrates a slight performance improvement compared to using the metrics on an end-to-end basis. Finally, our results also demonstrate that multiple sinks inside a WSN improve the RPL-based protocol performance.	etx (form factor);end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;expected transmission count;greedy algorithm;lossy compression;low-power broadcasting;network packet;routing;simulation	Muhammad Omer Farooq;Cormac J.

1682371ab95b639f745a0cc742a685edb9db5840	pradd: a path reliability-aware data delivery protocol for underwater acoustic sensor networks	path reliability;node movement;link transmission reliability;underwater acoustic sensor networks uasns	Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) are becoming increasingly promising to monitor aquatic environment. However, reliable data delivery remains challenging due to long propagation delay and high error-rate of underwater acoustic channel, limited energy and inherent mobility of sensor nodes. To address these issues, we propose a protocol called Path Reliability-Aware Data Delivery (PRADD) to improve data transfer reliability for delay tolerant underwater traffic. Data delivery reliability is significantly improved by selecting the next hop forwarder on-the-fly based on its link reliability, reachability to gateways and coverage probability through probabilistic estimation. Data forwarding solution is coupled with delay tolerant networking paradigm to improve delivery with reduced overhead. PRADD does not require active localization technique to estimate the updated location of a sensor node except its initial coarse location. The movement of an anchored node is exploited to estimate its coverage probability. Mobile message ferries are used to collect stored data from one or more nodes, called gateways. A strategy for gateway selection is devised to maximize their lifetime. Simulation results show that PRADD achieves significant performance improvement over competing protocols using low overhead and less energy.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Nusrat Nowsheen;Gour C.

Such being the case, this paper first analyzes this problem and proposes a routing interference optimization mechanism FCE based on distributed fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The fuzzy principle is introduced to the priority calculation of the node. In doing so, the fuzzy linear transformation principle and the maximum membership principle are used to classify the dynamic nature of candidate nodes and to select well-performed candidates from the optimal candidate nodes. In spite of the few number of those candidates, they are qualified to compete for the right of next-hop forwarding, such that the routing interference will become less probable and the data forwarding is rendered more efficient. Finally, through a simulation test, our method is verified effective.	interference (communication);optimization mechanism;routing	Xinchun Wang;Haishan Zhang;Mi Li;Ying Li	2017	iJOE		routing table;routing;transmission;static routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.849223568878852	82.17774015424328	180864

The main challenge facing a routing protocol is to cope with the dynamic environment of mobile ad hoc networks. The problem of finding best route between communication end points in such networks is an NP problem. Swarm algorithm is one of the methods used solve such a problem. However, copping with the dynamic environment will demand the use of a lot of training iterations. We present a new infrastructure where data packets are smart enough to guide themselves through best available route in the network. This approach uses distributed swarm learning approach which will minimize convergence time by using smart data packets. This will decrease the number of control packets in the network as well as it provides continues learning which in turn provides better reaction to changes in the network environment. The learning information is distributed throughout the nodes of the network. This information can be used and updated by successive packets in order to maintain and find better routes. This protocol is a hybrid Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and River formation dynamics (RFD) swarm algorithms protocol. ACO is used to set up multi-path routes to destination at the initialization, while RFD mainly used as a base algorithm for the routing protocol. RFD offers many advantages toward implementing this approach. The main two reasons of using RFD are the small amount of information that required to be added to the packets (12 bytes in our approach) and the main idea of the RFD algorithm which is based on one kind of agent called drop that moves from source to * Corresponding author. phone +447543386452, e-mail: saman.amin@brunel.ac.uk (Saman Hameed Amin). destination only. This will eliminate the need of feedback packets to update the network and offers a suitable solution to change data packet into smart packets. Simulation results shows improvement in the throughput and reduction in end to end delay and jitter compared to AODV and AntHocNet protocols.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;byte;email;hoc (programming language);iteration;np (complexity);network packet;routing;smart;simulation;swarm;swarm intelligence;throughput	Saman Hameed Amin;Hamed S.

Recent studies show that the energy consumed for routing data-packets in mobile ad hoc networks can be significantly reduced compared with the min-hop full-power routing protocols. One of the promising mechanisms proposed in literature to reduce the energy consumption is the transmission power control. In this paper, we define new routing metrics to strike a balance between the required power minimisation and batteries freshness consideration. We also define a new technique which allows the distribution of the routing task over nodes. Using these metrics and techniques we derive from DSR [2] a new power-aware and power-efficient routing protocol, whose performance is analysed by simulation in different situations of mobility and network load.	hoc (programming language);routing	Djamel Djenouri;Nadjib Badache	2006	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2006.009882	vehicular ad hoc network;policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile computing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.983339102873544	81.81908078403664	181442

Due to the rapidly-changing topologies, limited wireless communication spectrum, latency, and priorities of tasks, it is vitally important to have dynamic spectrum management between aircrafts and base station in airborne networks. Particularly, we encounter two major challenges: (1) uncertainty about channel quality, in terms of the long-term channel statistics and real-time channel states; (2) the dynamics and the possibly correlated nature of channel quality of different aircrafts. To address these two challenges, we propose a distributed framework for spectrum management in airborne networks, which includes: 1) channel quality prediction based on correlation of channel quality among aircrafts; 2) task scheduling in the aircraft. With real-world trace data, we conduct extensive experiments. Our simulation results show that our design can effectively optimize the channel utilization in airborne network.	airborne ranger;experiment;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Zhichuan Huang;David Corrigan;Sandeep Narayanan;Ting Zhu;Elizabeth S.

The energy saving is achieved by (1) merging several small flood messages into a larger one, and (2) limiting the scope of a flood message. Our simulation results show that, at the cost of an increased message forwarding delay, the proposed approach can substantially reduce flood messages energy consumption without increasing their delivery failure rates. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The proposed scheme associates the backward difference traffic moments with the sleep-time duration to tune the activity durations of a node for achieving optimal energy conservation and alleviating the uncontrolled energy consumption of wireless devices. Efficient routing protocol operation, as a matter of maximum energy conservation, maximum-possible routing paths establishments and minimum delays is obtained, by utilizing a signalling mechanism, developed based on a simulation scenario that includes a number of secondary communication nodes.

d36ebd43ceb96f78bfd4a29205f65e31ffaa4284	energy‐efficient management using a traffic‐oriented routing scheme for cognitive radio networks		This paper elaborates on a traffic manipulation routing scheme that associates the moments of the traffic, targeting the maximization of the energy conservation, as well as the effective resource management of the network nodes. The energy conservation is achieved through the data flow coordination, in association with the data traffic volume and the resource exchange, between the nodes that exploit radio spectrum access in cognitive radio networking architectures. The routing scheme that is proposed in this paper interrelates the backward difference of traffic moments for each node based on a series model, together with the sleep-time period, towards reflecting this measurement to the minimization of the nodes activity durations to achieve energy conservation. The effective operation of the routing scheme is achieved by exploiting a signalling mechanism that was adopted for the proper communication of the nodes over the available radio spectrum parts, such as the television white spaces. Simulation tests were conducted towards examining the validity of the proposed routing scheme via multiple performance evaluation experiments. Simulation results have shown the offered reliability and the efficiency of the proposed traffic-aware scheme, in reference to the efficient energy consumption of the networking nodes and the minimization of the delays.

It can be achieved by improving the efficiency of transmission by establishing coordinated communication across relay terminals. Complexity of interaction among accessing the medium is an erroneous source in relay. First an effective relay must be chosen under proper coordination among the entire network for excellent data broadcasting and delivery. Second requirement is to allocate proper time management schedules. The relaying technique is to minimize the energy consumption and to avoid data loss by mitigating packet drop. It is achieved by implementing NLORE protocol which aims at providing high energy conservation and improves the throughput. We use TDMA scheduling for managing the time slot. This scheduling aims at providing proper coordination in the network. Network coordination is necessary not just to reduce the packet drop but also to reduce retransmission of redundant data. NLORE and TDMA are implemented to work in hand with each other to meet the primary goal.	relay	S. Raj Barath;C.

0fe3fe1ad5db2f878e3f546bcdae6b221f638ca1	balanced multi-channel data collection in wireless sensor networks		Data collection is an essential task in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In data collection process, the sensor nodes transmit their readings to a common base station called Sink. To avoid a collision, it is necessary to use the appropriate scheduling algorithms for data transmission. On the other hand, multi-channel design is considered as a promising technique to reduce network interference and latency of data collection. This technique allows parallel transmissions on different frequency channels, thus time latency will be reduced. In this paper, we present a new scheduling method for multi-channel WSNs called Balanced Multi Channel Data Collection (Balanced MC-DC) Algorithm. The proposed protocol is based on using both Non-Overlapping Channels (NOC) and Partially Overlapping Channels (POC). It uses a new approach that optimizes the processes of tree construction, channel allocation, transmission scheduling and balancing simultaneously. Extensive simulations confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the existing algorithms in wireless sensor networks.	algorithm;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);network on a chip;network topology;scheduling (computing);simulation	Zahra Adelani;Ghasem Mirjalily;Milad HajMirzaei	2018	IJCNIS		distributed computing;computer network;wireless sensor network;data collection;latency (engineering);sink (computing);channel allocation schemes;data transmission;scheduling (computing);computer science;communication channel	Mobile	9.289968175317416	82.36551653518299	184466

This system uses only one aeronautical VHF channel with air-to-air radio relay system based on local mobile Ad-hoc networks. For access of all aircrafts in the system, a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) scheme is proposed to be used where each aircraft is assigned with one time slot during its presence in the system in order to transmit its own packet by itself or to be relayed its packets by neighbor aircrafts. These packets contain aircraft position, ID, relative direction and all of which are used to build a routing table at each aircraft. In addition, several algorithms for relaying packets and a scheme to reduce the packet-loss-ratio have been proposed. This system strengthens the reliability of oceanic aeronautical communication and increases situational awareness of all oceanic flights as an effective solution to operate more flights on the oceans but in higher safety.	advanced transportation controller;algorithm;backup;communications satellite;digital data;hoc (programming language);maximal set;network packet;numerical analysis;relay;routing table;xfig	Dac-Tu Ho;Shigeru Shimamoto	2009	2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems	10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.91	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	5.706077411045281	87.56867729833681	184695

However, there are great challenges to meet multi-objective transmission requirements in industrial monitoring WSNs. This paper proposes a Pareto based multi-optimization approach POCTP (Pareto Optimal Collection Tree Protocol) to ensure QoS (e.g. transmission throughput, delay, loss of packets). Unique Pareto route set based routing framework, including link quality estimator, routing setting up and routing engine, is put forwarded grounding on the collection tree protocol (CTP). Furthermore, comprehensive and reasonable hierarchical Petri net based verification model is set up and the behavior of the routing algorithm is illustrated. Then, the proposed optimization scheme is applied into an industrial monitoring scenario to optimize main performance measures of monitoring networks. Finally, the simulation results prove the correctness and scalability of the algorithm.

d535b89496ff395af24f7b4996cbe315142b9bcf	comprehensive performance analysis of rpl objective functions in iot networks		As the movement for a vast implementation of IoT networks is rapidly accelerating, so many researchers are working to analyze the performance of RPL, the widely-used routing protocol for wireless sensor networks. The analysis usually involves a small number of metrics studied under a limited number of scenarios. In this paper however, we provide a comprehensive study for the performance of the two objective functions used in RPL; MRHOF and OF0, using the Cooja simulator in Contiki operating system. Using static-grid and mobile-random topologies with 25, 49, and 81 sender nodes including one sink node. Each topology was tested with three transmission ranges of 11, 20, and 50 meters to simulate sparse, moderate and dense networks. The selected metrics are convergence time, changes in DoDAG tree structures, average churn in the network, Average Power Consumption, Average Listen Duty Cycle, Average Transmit Duty Cycle, Average received packets, average lost packets, average duplicate packets, and average hop count. In fixed networks, the results show that OF0 usually perform better than MRHOF in terms of Energy Consumption, Convergence Time in the Static-Grid Topology, Listen Duty Cycle, and Transmit Duty Cycle.

The routing protocol involved should use battery power efficiently for good system performance. For systems where node location information is available, this study proposes an on-demand routing protocol for choosing a route based on maximising the minimum node battery power and minimising the total transmission power required to reach the destination. In addition, the routing protocol proposed is able to restrict control packet flooding during route discovery and pre-empt link breakages because of node mobility. A power and mobility aware optimisation problem is first formulated. For an actual practical implementation, we present a heuristic scheme, Power and Mobility Aware Routing or PMAR protocol. PMAR performs almost as well as the proposed optimisation approach in static networks. In mobile networks, PMAR performs very well in terms of network lifetime, the number of data packets carried within the network lifetime and delay performance. It is shown to be energy efficient, effective in restricting control packet flooding and able to substantially reduce the network overheads caused by link breakages.	hoc (programming language);routing	Wesley Chee-Wah Tan;Sanjay K.

Moreover, when hidden terminals are present, collisions are even more noticeable since the vulnerability time is proportional to the long preamble duration. This effect reduces considerably the network performance as both the number of collisions and the resources spent in them are significant. The effects of hidden nodes in preamble sampling WSNs, in different case scenarios and under variable offered loads, are analyzed in this work. Results show that the impact of hidden terminals in the network performance is non-negligible, specially at medium to high loads. These results should be considered by MAC protocol designers in order to devise mechanisms to mitigate the hidden terminal problem. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

WSNs expect not only providing routing with high throughput but also achieving efficient energy saving. Network coding is one of the most promising techniques to reduce the energy consumption. By maximizing the encoding number, the message capacity per package can be extended to the most efficient condition. Thus, many researchers have focused their work on this field. Nevertheless, the packages sent by the outer nodes need to be temporary stored and delayed in order to maximize the encoding number. To find out the balance between inserting the delay time and maximizing the encoding number, a Converge-cast Scheme based on data collection rate prediction (CSRP) is proposed in this paper. To avoid producing the outdated information, a prediction method based on Modifying Index Curve Model is presented to deal with the dynamic data collection rate of every sensor in WSNs. Furthermore, a novel coding conditions based on CDS is proposed to increase the coding opportunity and to solve the collision problems. The corresponding analysis and experimental results indicate that the feasibility and efficiency of the CSRP is better than normal conditions without the prediction.	converge;linear network coding	Li Xu;Jing Zhang;Yang Xiang;Xinyi Huang	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3725-7	data collection;real-time computing;collision;throughput;linear network coding;computer network;computer science;wireless sensor network;energy consumption;dynamic data;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	9.233231703083035	81.85693754651143	186078

Although it is now a standard, the IEEE 802.11p protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) has known shortcomings. Dissemination is not reliable over distances higher than 300 m and congestion in the communication channel can lead to very low rates of safety messages delivery. Multi-hop routing and access channel techniques are well known approaches that were separately investigated to improve network effectiveness. However, achieving low end-to-end latency with multi-hop techniques is usually at the cost of lower data delivery rates, which in turn causes problems for the effectiveness of safety services embedded in vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a new dissemination and congestion avoidance scheme for safety messages over IEEE 802.11p VANETs. In order to ensure good delivery rates beyond 300 m, the approach propagates information over two hops while avoiding the resulting congestion by using a fully distributed asymmetrical transmit power adjustment technique. The scheme uses two time-dependent optimization-under-constraint processes to elect the best vehicle to act as a relay for data forwarding. The scheme can estimate the probability of reception rate (PRR), and adjust the forwarding distance to meet the minimum requirements of PRR and delivery distance to fit specific safety application requirements. The proposed solution, unlike previous dissemination techniques, works simultaneously on reducing congestion due to multi-hop relaying and on ensuring low end-to-end delay. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation and relaying scheme and its advantageous network performance compared to others, under various traffic constraints.	network congestion	Omar Chakroun;Soumaya Cherkaoui	2014	Vehicular Communications	10.1016/j.vehcom.2014.05.003	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Networks	5.5041689170011585	87.59537301336616	186553

In VANETs and MANETs, the topology of the network changes very often, therefore implementation of efficient routing protocols is very important problem. In MANETs, the Random Waypoint (RW) model is used as a simulation model for generating node mobility pattern. On the other hand, in VANETs, the mobility patterns of nodes is restricted along the roads, and is affected by the movement of neighbour nodes. In this paper, we present a simulation system for VANET called CAVENET (Cellular Automaton based Vehicular NETwork). In CAVENET, the mobility patterns of nodes are generated by an 1-dimensional cellular automata. We improved CAVENET and implemented some routing protocols. We investigated the performance of the implemented routing protocols by CAVENET. The simulation results have shown that DYMO protocol has better performance than AODV and OLSR protocols.	automata theory;cellular automaton;communications protocol;design review (u.s. government);goodput;hoc (programming language);matlab;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;read-write memory;simulation;software propagation;waypoint	Leonard Barolli;Gjergji Mino;Fatos Xhafa;Arjan Durresi;Akio Koyama	2010	2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops	10.1109/ICDCSW.2010.45	cellular automaton;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.1242246260771993	85.80401449963114	186778

This paper addresses the problem of finding an optimal path with guaranteed delivery of packets and low overhead. In this position-based routing, the physical position of the nodes is known through the use of GPS or some other types of positioning services. Each node knows its own position, one-hop neighbor position, and destination node position. Because of limited transmission range and limited energy, intermediate nodes take into participation and contribute to packet forwarding. This algorithm used a greedy forwarding approach to forward the packets toward destination and a clustering approach to save energy. Network area is divided into fixed size of zones, and a VIP node selects a best forwarding node in the next zone by using a directional routing (DIR) greedy approach. The objective is to deal with issues of network design and provide an optimal path without unnecessary transmission. We compare VIP routing algorithm with an existing routing algorithm. Both theoretical analysis and simulation result show an excellent performance under low node mobility.	best-effort delivery	Vipin Kumar;Sushil Kumar	2013		10.1007/978-81-322-1665-0_131	wireless sensor network;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	6.576819746845715	81.70179727423448	186782

To conserve energy, application-specific aggregation (fusion) of data reports from multiple sensors can be beneficial in reducing the amount of data flowing over the network. Furthermore, controlling the topology by scheduling the activity of nodes between active and sleep modes has often been used to uniformly distribute the energy consumption among all nodes by de-synchronizing their activities. We present an integrated analytical model to study the joint performance of in-network aggregation and topology control. We define performance metrics that capture the tradeoffs among delay, energy, and fidelity of the aggregation. Our results indicate that to achieve high fidelity levels under medium to high event reporting load, shorter and fatter aggregation/routing trees (toward the sink) offer the best delay-energy tradeoff as long as topology control is well coordinated with routing.	data aggregation;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor;sleep mode;topology control	Vijay Erramilli;Ibrahim Matta;Azer Bestavros	2004	2004 First Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2004.

We investigate the performance metrics in terms of the packet delivery ratio, the message reception ratio as well as the transmission cost. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate that our proposed IHO protocol significantly improves the packet delivery ratio and the overall message reception ratio.	broadcast domain;network packet;network performance;simulation	Sok-Ian Sou;Cheng-Hao Wu	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)	10.1109/ICICS.2015.7459880	communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;handover;operating system;computer security;server;computer network	Mobile	4.848001825367795	87.8993785230311	187232

That is because fixed probe interval of ETX cannot adapt the change of network environment. Through simulations we verify the problem of ETX and find the relationship between routing performance and network factor (data rate). Then we propose an optimization routing mechanism with variable probe interval based on ETX (vp-ETX). The probe interval of ETX will be changed according to the information of data rate which is acquired from the application layer. The results of simulations show that vp-ETX could change probe interval of nodes according to real-time network environment and vp-ETX performs better than ETX in specific scenario.	cloud computing;data rate units;etx (form factor);end-to-end principle;expected transmission count;mathematical optimization;metrics (networking);network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;routing;simulation;testbed;throughput;uncompressed video;vp/css;wireless mesh network	Weifeng Sun;Haotian Wang;Xiaomin Han;Tie Qiu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things(iThings), and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom)	10.1109/iThings.2014.47	wireless mesh network;data modeling;routing;throughput;real-time computing;computer science;base station;distributed computing;metrics;measurement;computer network	Embedded	7.7433942491221455	86.69342259115055	187836

The topology includes bi-directional roadways, left-turn lane, straight through lane, right-turn lane with traffic lights deployed at the intersections. Due to the multi-hop feature of data delivery and the limited range of radio transmission, the roadways’ topology and the switch operations of traffic lights will jointly affect the data delivery delay. By employing the queuing theory and analyzing the traffic lights operations, we propose the formulae of data delivery delay for different scenarios and extend the analysis to a more general scenario. We find that in the scenario of single intersection, the data delivery delay can be reduced by appropriately selecting the relay nodes. Specifically, in the case of green traffic light at the intersection, opposite lane vehicles can be used to reduce the delay, while for red traffic light, left-turn lane vehicles are used to reduce the delay in a similar approach, i.e., by using multi-hop transmission.

5f9938b63d589f8ecd0c92b2a59a9f46ee312ca3	a mobility-aware trust management scheme for emergency communication networks using dtn		In the aftermath of a disaster, collecting and disseminating critical information is very challenging. The damage to telecommunication infrastructures makes its extremely difficult to have an effective recovery and relief operation. In this paper, we consider the use of DTN as an alternative measure to temporarily disseminate emergency information in a post disaster scenario using the Post Disaster Model recommended by IETF. We consider internally motivated attacks where responder nodes are compromised thereby dropping packets forwarded to them. We design a Mobility-Aware Trust Management Scheme (MATMS) to mitigate this routing misbehaviour. We evaluate our proposed scheme through extensive simulations and compare our results with existing benchmarks schemes. Our results show that the use of adequate collaborative strategies can improve the performance of DTNs under attack taking into consideration the delivery probability and message delay from source node to the destination node.	delay-tolerant networking;trust management (managerial science)	Philip Michael Asuquo;Haitham S.

The performance of ad-hoc networks depends on the cooperative and trust nature of these devices or nodes. The initiator node has to rely on other intermediate nodes to relay the message to the destination node. In this paper, a trust management scheme for MANET environments is proposed, where trust value is utilized for establishing the communication link between the node that initiates the communication (initiator node) and the destination node. Graph theoretic approach is utilized in the proposed scheme to find the path and both direct trust and recommendation of the neighboring nodes are utilized for computing the trusted communication path. By this trust management scheme the highest trusted but minimum routing path is achieved from the initiator node to the destination node. This trust management scheme can be included in any efficient routing algorithm to achieve highest trusted but minimum routing path from the initiator node to the destination node.	algorithm;autonomous robot;computation;cryptography;hoc (programming language);mobile device;numerical analysis;relay;routing;scsi initiator and target;session (computer science);theory;trust management (information system);trusted path	Mohammad Ghulam Rahman	2011	The 17th Asia Pacific Conference on Communications	10.1109/APCC.2011.6152868	distributed computing;node;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.810908360310708	81.86621684548787	188320

When directional antennas are used, this process becomes more challenging since two neighboring nodes must be in transmit and receive states, respectively, pointing their antennas to each other simultaneously. Most of the proposed neighbor discovery algorithms only consider the synchronous system and cannot work efficiently in the asynchronous environment. However, asynchronous neighbor discovery algorithms are more practical and offer many potential advantages. In this paper, we first analyze a one-way handshake-based asynchronous neighbor discovery algorithm by introducing a mathematical model named “Problem of Coloring Balls.” Then, we extend it to a hybrid asynchronous algorithm that leads to a 24.4% decrease in the expected time of neighbor discovery. Compared with the synchronous algorithms, the asynchronous algorithms require approximately twice the time to complete the neighbor discovery process. Our proposed hybrid asynchronous algorithm performs better than both the two-way synchronous algorithm and the two-way asynchronous algorithm. We validate the practicality of our proposed asynchronous algorithms by OPNET simulations.	algorithm;average-case complexity;ball project;color;diagram;graph coloring;hoc (programming language);mathematical model;one-way function;simulation;synchronous circuit	Feng Tian;Bo Liu;Hao Cai;Haibo Zhou;Lin Gui	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2449335	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;algorithm design;synchronization;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor discovery protocol;computer science;directional antenna;theoretical computer science;asynchronous communication;distributed computing;approximation algorithm;computer network	EDA	10.02844052318002	82.59057246239539	188705

To the best of our knowledge, CHNP is the first multi-channel MAC protocol specially designed for industrial WSN applications, which pays special attention to the reliability performance, and makes comprehensive optimization on energy, delay, and throughput performance at the same time. The following contributions are made in CHNP: first, a novel MAC framework based on synchronized channel hopping mechanism is proposed, which provides a good platform to perform the comprehensive performance optimization; second, an effective interference domain division mechanism is designed to achieve higher performance; third, an adaptive transmission mechanism is designed, which can sidestep the bad channels and realize reliable communication even under harsh RF environment; last, a sniffing mechanism is provided to achieve low energy operation.

BeeAdHoc is a reactive source routing algorithm and it consumes less energy as compared to existing state-of-the-art routing algorithms because it utilizes less control packets to do routing. The results of our extensive simulation experiments show that BeeAdHoc consumes significantly less energy as compared to DSR, AODV, and DSDV, which are state-of-the-art routing algorithms, without making any compromise on traditional performance metrics (packet delivery ratio, delay and throughput).	ansi escape code;algorithm;experiment;hoc (programming language);network packet;simulation;source routing;throughput	Horst F.

Its performance depends on two key factors: the device mobility pattern,, the message transmission time. The mobility pattern determines the contact time, duration. If contact durations are shorter than the required transmission times, some messages will not get delivered,, the whole diffusion scheme will be seriously hampered. In this paper we evaluate the impact of message transmission times in epidemic diffusion processes. We demonstrate how, when certain conditions hold, forcing devices to stop moving to complete the data delivery process can improve their performance. We implemented this mobility model, called Forced Stop, in the ONE (Opportunistic Networking Environment) simulator,, we show that, for large message sizes, the diffusion performance is increased. These results can be a relevant indication to the designers of opportunistic networks applications that could integrate in their products strategies to inform the user about the need to temporarily stop to increase the overall data delivery.	gossip protocol	Jorge Herrera-Tapia;Enrique Hernández-Orallo;Pietro Manzoni;Andrés Tomás;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Juan-Carlos Cano	2016	2016 Intl IEEE Conferences on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP-SmartWorld.2016.0027	wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;mathematical model;computer network	Mobile	4.105227807417489	85.9496086547983	190092

Data collection in VANets is considered as an interesting application which aims at providing a safer, more efficient and more comfortable driving. In a previous study [8] we have proposed a Robust Clustered Data Gathering Protocol (CDGP), by using a Dynamic Space Division Multiple Access (D-SDMA) technique with a retransmission mechanism. However, CDGP provides a low collection efficiency given the large number of unused slots, which are wasted in a vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V). In this paper, we propose a new data collection protocol, which improves the data collection efficiency by using an enhanced Dynamic SDMA technique. Through simulation results we show that our new protocol enhances data collection efficiency and provides a reliable data collection.	cluster analysis;entity;hoc (programming language);retransmission (data networks);simulation;standard database management analysis;vehicle-to-vehicle	Bouziane Brik;Nasreddine Lagraa;Hadda Cherroun;Abderrahmane Lakas	2013	2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583705	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.507261912412249	87.59015222584111	190500
7dd1ca045bcaf25c116389793d2d25e62c873cf1	geographic routing with partial position information		Geographic routing protocols show good properties for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). They are stateless, local and scalable. However they require that each node of the network is aware of its own position. While it may be possible to equip each node with GPS receiver, even if it is costly, there are some issues and receiving a usable GPS signal may be difficult in some situations. For these reasons, we propose a geographic routing algorithm, called HGA, able to take advantages of position informations of nodes when available but also able to continue the routing in a more traditional way if position information is not available. We show with simulations that our algorithm offers an alternative solution to classical routing algorithm (non-geographic) and offers better performances for network with a density above 25 and more than 5% of nodes are aware of their position.	algorithm;gps signals;geographic routing;global positioning system;greedy algorithm;hercules graphics card;hop-by-hop transport;overhead (computing);performance;precedence effect;scalability;simulation;stateless protocol	Tony Ducrocq;Michaël Hauspie;Nathalie Mitton	2014		10.5220/0004872901650172	routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.96606908522774	81.77647722010381	190997

In this paper, we focus on the challenges faced when modelling the vehicular environment and the solutions adopted in the main simulation tools.

The SDFM learns vehicles' social characteristics in a distributed manner, and then transfers messages in a “Store-Carry-Forward” pattern. SDFM describes the sociality of a vehicle as centrality and community. Based on these two metrics, for each message, a vehicle forwards it to the vehicle with higher global centrality than itself till it meets a vehicle within the same community as the message's final destination, and then forwards the message to the vehicle with higher local centrality till it is finally delivered. The SDFM calculates vehicles' centralities by computing the mobile entropies of vehicles, and determines vehicles' communities by adopting a distributed K-Clique algorithm on recorded intermeeting time as well as meeting frequencies between vehicles. Experimental results show that, for civic moving vehicles, SDFM mechanism has significantly improved the message delivery ratio and the average delivery delay performances when compared with a social based routing protocol bubble rap which is designed for data forwarding in packet switch networks.	algorithm;attribute–value pair;centrality;dot-com bubble;end-to-end principle;network packet;operand forwarding;packet switching;performance;routing;vehicle-to-vehicle	Rui Tian;Zhenzhen Jiao;Guiyun Bian;Zhiqing Huang;Yibin Hou	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China (ChinaCom)	10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7498007	vehicular ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;social learning;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.447666037809078	84.2742291126426	192007

The Routing Protocol for Low power and lossy networks (RPL), which is standardized as an IPv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy networks, uses the trickle timer algorithm to handle changes in the network topology. However, this algorithm is not well adapted to dynamic environments. This paper enhances the trickle timer in order to fit with mobility requirements. Most of previous works have improved this algorithm without considering the random movement of nodes. In this work, the proposed timer algorithm takes into consideration the random trajectory of mobile nodes, pause time and node's velocity. It is also dynamically adjusted to prevent from node disconnections. The performance of the modified protocol is evaluated and compared with native RPL, MERPL and RPL with reverse Trickle. The results show that our protocol optimization offers better performance.	555 timer ic;algorithm;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;modulo operation;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);requirement;routing;simulation;velocity (software development)	Fatma Gara;Leila Ben Saad;Elyes Ben Hamida;Bernard Tourancheau;Rahma Ben Ayed	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577138	communications protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;network topology;computer network	Mobile	4.6211149309427055	82.10537631287545	193007

Reliability concept describes essentially the transmission characteristics of infrastructureless networks, such as packet loss probability, packet duplication, data misinsertion, and corruption of packets. Some other metrics nowadays, aggregate and contribute to the aggravation of end to end reliability. In this work a new scheme for end to end reliable file/resource sharing is studied, among mobile peer-topeer users. The proposed scheme uses the Hybrid Mobile Infostation System (HyMIS) to maintain and enhance the reliability of file/ resource sharing process among wireless devices. Under various storage constraints the epidemic backup node selection is adopted, merging the advantages of epidemic file dissemination through purely mobile Infostations, using the HyMIS architecture. Examination through simulation is performed, taking into account many newly introduced storage metrics, for the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme. These storage metrics are tuned into certain bounded values to enable high packet delivery ratio. Results show that this scheme under certain storage requirements offer a reliable and robust solution for sharing resources of any capacity in dynamic mobile peer-to-peer wireless environments. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This limitation has led to the crucial need for energy-aware protocols to produce an efficient network. In this paper, we propose an energy aware geographical multipath routing scheme for WSNs. The distance to the destination location, remaining battery capacity, and queue size of candidate sensor nodes in the local communication range are taken into consideration for next hop relay node selection, and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied for decision making. Simulation results show that this scheme can extend the network lifetime longer than the original geographical routing scheme which only considers distance to the destination location. Moreover, the proposed scheme can reduce the packet loss rate and link failure rate since the buffer capacity is considered.	analytical hierarchy;failure rate;multipath routing;network packet;relay;sensor;simulation	Xiaoling Wu;Jinsung Cho;Brian J. d'Auriol;Sungyoung Lee	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-75664-4_47	routing;analytic hierarchy process;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	7.470718725927664	81.72444564581319	193364

Several schemes have been proposed to mitigate this latency, but they are mainly optimized for light traffic loads. A WSN, however, could often experience bursty and high traffic loads, such as due to broadcast or convergecast traffic. In this paper, we present a new MAC protocol, called Demand Wakeup MAC (DW-MAC), that introduces a new low-overhead scheduling algorithm that allows nodes to wake up on demand during the Sleep period of an operational cycle and ensures that data transmissions do not collide at their intended receivers. This demand wakeup adaptively increases effective channel capacity during an operational cycle as traffic load increases, allowing DW-MAC to achieve low delivery latency under a wide range of traffic loads including both unicast and broadcast traffic. We compare DW-MAC with S-MAC (with and without adaptive listening) and with RMAC using ns-2 and show that DW-MAC outperforms these protocols, with increasing benefits as traffic load increases. For example, under high unicast traffic load, DW-MAC reduces delivery latency by 70% compared to S-MAC and RMAC, and uses only 50% of the energy consumed with S-MAC with adaptive listening. Under broadcast traffic, DW-MAC reduces latency by more than 50% on average while maintaining higher energy efficiency.	algorithm;broadcasting (networking);channel capacity;digimon world;dreamwidth;duty cycle;network packet;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);unicast	Yanjun Sun;Shu Du;Omer Gurewitz;David B.

Traffic in these applications exhibits a many-to-one pattern, in which multiple source nodes send sensing data to a single sink node. Since bandwidth and storage capacity is highly constrained in sensor networks, packet loss is inevitable when a great deal of traffic rushes to sink. Based on the observation that the packets are not equal in the serving of event detection, we propose to employ priority-based queue management method (PBQM) to improve packet delivery ratio of more important packets. We put forward three priority mapping schemes and evaluate the performance of PBQM method by simulation with Ns-2.	design review (u.s. government);network packet;one-to-many (data model);simulation;throughput	Xianglan Yin;Hua Chen;Yang Shen	2007	I.

Low duty cycle MAC conserves energy but at the same time it affects delivery ratio and latency. Use of multiple channels can improve the throughput and latency by alleviating the bandwidth limitations. This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of PW-MMAC (Predictive Wake up Multi-Channel MAC) protocol which addresses these challenges by coupling the benefits of multiple channels with adaptive duty cycling and predictive wake-up mechanism. PW-MMAC significantly improves energy efficiency and channel utilization by adapting dynamically to varying network conditions without the need of a dedicated control channel. Implemented in ns-2, PWMMAC shows significant improvement over other duty cycle MAC protocols. PW-MMAC achieves lowest duty cycle, 100% delivery ratio, and lowest packet delivery latency in different network scenarios in both multi-hop and single-hop clique, grid, and random networks.	access control;clique (graph theory);duty cycle;elegant degradation;flow network;interrupt latency;metal gear solid: peace walker;network packet;performance evaluation;pseudo-wire;pseudorandomness;rs-232;random number generation;throughput;uptime	Muhammad Bilal Saleemi;Shagufta Henna	2016	2016 UKSim-AMSS 18th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation (UKSim)	10.1109/UKSim.2016.40	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.97870264898427	84.65855296641608	193826

In this paper, we try to characterize the delay incurred by sensed packets traversing across the network. We derive the source and destination distance, hop count distribution under typical sensor traffic patterns. Then how various network parameters, such as the node density and the transmission range, impact on delay and delay distribution is investigated.

The proposed detection mechanism aims to accurately detect the failure of a cluster head in order to avoid unnecessary energy consumption caused by a mistaken detection. For this purpose, it allows each cluster member to independently detect the fault status of its cluster head and at the same time employs a distributed agreement protocol to reach an agreement on the fault status of the cluster head among multiple cluster members. The detection mechanism is based a TDMA MAC protocol used in the network and runs concurrently with normal network operation by periodically performing a distributed detection process at each cluster member. To reduce energy consumption, it makes use of the data periodically sent by a cluster head as the heartbeats for fault detection. A couple of forward and backward TDM frames are specially structured for enabling multiple cluster members to reach an agreement within two frames in each detection process. Moreover, a schedule generation algorithm is also proposed for a cluster head to generate the transmission schedule of the forward and backward frames. Through simulation results, we show that the proposed detection mechanism can achieve high detection accuracy under high packet loss rates in the harsh underwater environment, and can faster detect a cluster-head failure than a traditional fault detection mechanism.	algorithm;computer cluster;fault detection and isolation;network packet;sensor;simulation;toad data modeler	Pu Wang;Jun Zheng;Cheng Li	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.230	underwater acoustic communication;real-time computing;genetic algorithm;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;time division multiple access;fault detection and isolation;computer network	Robotics	9.178680063177314	81.75897988572598	194340

These routing protocols are designed principally for urban areas with high node density and fully connected networks and are not suitable for packet delivery in a sparse, partially connected VANET. In this article, we examine the challenges of VANETs in sparse network conditions, review alternatives including epidemic routing, and propose a border node-based routing protocol for partially connected VANETs. The BBR protocol can tolerate network partition due to low node density and high node mobility. The performance of epidemic routing and BBR are evaluated with a geographic and traffic information- based mobility model that captures typical highway conditions. The simulation results show that under rural network conditions, a limited flooding protocol such as BBR performs well and offers the advantage of not relying on a location service required by other protocols proposed for VANETs.	behavior-based robotics;communications protocol;hoc (programming language);ibm notes;location-based service;network block device;network packet;network partition;routing;simulation;sparse matrix;telecommunications network	Mingliu Zhang;Richard S.

Local routing protocols aim at decreasing the overhead of the routing process while exploring the route by choosing, in a greedy manner, one of the direct neighbors. On the contrary, global routing protocols choose the optimal route by exploring the whole network to the destination paying the flooding overhead cost. In this paper, we propose a primary user-aware <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""""abdelmessih-ieq1-2828104.gif""""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-hop routing scheme where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""""abdelmessih-ieq2-2828104.gif""""/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the discovery radius. This scheme can be plugged into any CRN routing protocol to adapt, in real time, to network dynamics like the number and activity of primary users. The aim of this scheme is to cover the gap between local and global routing protocols for CRNs. It is based on balancing the routing overhead and the route optimality, in terms of primary users avoidance, according to a user-defined utility function. We analytically derive the optimal discovery radius (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""""abdelmessih-ieq3-2828104.gif""""/> </alternatives></inline-formula>) that achieves this target.

In previous works, it has been shown that widening this path to create a corridor of forwarding nodes and applying OFDMA to split and merge the data as it travels through the corridor towards the destination node leads to considerable gains in achievable throughput compared to the case forwarding data along a unicast route. However, the problem of selecting potential nodes to act as forwarding nodes within the corridor has not been addressed in the literature, as in general a rather homogeneous network topology with equally spaced relay clusters per hop between source and destination node has been assumed. In this paper, a more realistic heterogeneous network is considered where the nodes in the area between source and destination are randomly distributed instead of being clustered with equal distance. A node selection scheme is presented which selects the forwarding nodes within the corridor based on a given unicast route between source and destination node. In simulations, it is shown that with the proposed node selection scheme, considerable throughput gains of up to 50 % compared to forwarding along unicast route can be achieved applying corridor-based routing in heterogeneous networks especially in sparse networks.	network topology;randomness;relay;routing;semantic network;simulation;sparse matrix;throughput;unicast	Alexander Kühne;Adrian Loch;Matthias Hollick;Anja Klein	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554877	routing table;routing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;packet forwarding;geographic routing;computer network;unicast	Mobile	6.01420542035178	86.14697983630411	195056

Several 3D position-based routing protocols were proposed to seek either delivery guarantee or energy-efficiency in 3D wireless networks. However, recent results [1,2] showed that there is no deterministic localized routing algorithm that guarantees either delivery of packets or energy-efficiency of its routes in 3D networks. In this paper, we focus on design of 3D greedy routing protocols which can guarantee delivery of packets and/or energy-efficiency of their paths with high probability in a randomly deployed 3D sensor network. In particular, we first study the asymptotic critical transmission radius for 3D greedy routing to ensure the packet delivery in large-scale random 3D sensor networks, then propose a refined 3D greedy routing protocol to achieve energy-efficiency of its paths with high probability. We also conduct extensive simulations to confirm our theoretical results. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient utilization of the energy is one of the most crucial issues in MANETs. Energy needs to be optimally utilized so that the nodes can perform their functionality satisfactorily. A node in MANET is a router as well, it could be difficult for a mobile node to sustain for a long time if it sends or receives data more often like in wired networks. Power failure of a mobile node not only affects the node itself but also its ability to forward the packets on behalf of others and thus overall network lifetime. Most of the studies in literature are based on topology-based routing protocols. This paper performs a comparative study of energy efficiency of some location-based and topology-based routing protocols using simulation. Different components of energy consumption are analyzed in different scenarios.	hoc (programming language);router (computing);routing;simulation	Ved Prakash;Brajesh Kumar;A. K.

bef9d9edd340eb09e2cda37cb7f4d4886a36fe66	a survey on position-based routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks (fanets)		Abstract The last decade has seen a growing interest in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for various applications and services. UAVs, or drones as referred to, have shown to be efficient in completing complex tasks when organized as ad hoc connected groups, thus forming a Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET). Although similar to Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) and Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET), FANETs have their own characteristics. One of the main difference is the fact that UAVs in general, but particularly when organized are FANETs, are mission-based, and their mobility models are often dictated by the purpose of their mission and the nature of the task they plan to accomplish. Therefore, routing protocols for FANETs should take into consideration the nature of the applications and services that the UAVs are deployed for, and factor in the mobility models. However, designing routing protocols for FANETs is not an easy task given the highly dynamic topology of FANETs and the flying constraints they are subjected to. Compared to topology-based routing, position-based routing demonstrated high efficiency and resilience to handle the high mobility of FANET nodes. To this end, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey of position-based routing protocols for FANETs with their various categories. We propose a classification and a taxonomy of these protocols, including a detailed description of the routing schemes used in each category. We propose a comparative study based on various criteria, and discuss the advantages and weaknesses of each protocol. Furthermore, new challenges for future research are presented, which introduce a new kind of coordination between UAVs and existing VANETs on the ground. The originality of this survey is that it complements the existing surveys on the same theme by providing more details on some aspects that have been addressed only ostensibly by other surveys in the literature.	geographic routing;hoc (programming language)	Omar Sami Oubbati;Abderrahmane Lakas;Fen Zhou;Mesut Günes;Mohamed Bachir Yagoubi	2017	Vehicular Communications	10.1016/j.vehcom.2017.10.003	optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc network;link-state routing protocol;computer network;wireless routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer science;routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	3.704201531394917	87.07629457679313	196243
31b3ed05cbbac8df2db6094dc721802cdc4c1a12	evaluating wireless reactive routing protocols with linear programming model for wireless ad-hoc networks		InWireless Ad-hoc Networks, nodes are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily, thus topology may change quickly and capriciously. In Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks, specially Wireless Multi-hop Networks provide users with facility of quick communication. In Wireless Multi-hop Networks, routing protocols with energy efficient and delay reduction techniques are needed to fulfill users’ demands. In this paper, we present Linear Programming models to assess and enhance reactive routing protocols. To practically examine constraints of respective Linear Programming models over reactive protocols, we select AODV, DSR and DYMO. It is deduced from analytical simulations of Linear Programming models in MATLAB that quick route repair reduces routing latency and optimizations of retransmission attempts results efficient energy utilization. To provide quick repair, we enhance AODV and DSR. To practically examine the efficiency of enhanced protocols in different scenarios of Wireless Multi-hop Networks, we conduct simulations using NS-2. From simulation results, enhanced DSR and AODV achieve efficient output by optimizing routing latencies and routing load in terms of retransmission attempts.	ansi escape code;hoc (programming language);ll parser;linear programming;matlab;maxima and minima;programming model;randomness;retransmission (data networks);routing;ruby document format;simulation;throughput	Nadeem Javaid;Manzoor Ilahi;R.

If not handled in an intelligent way, redundancy results in energy wasting because of (often unnecessary) redundant transmission and reception operations. We propose to take benefit from measurement redundancy to optimize the energy consumption and improve the end-to-end delay. We propose MR-LEACH (Measurement Redundancy aware LEACH) protocol, which is an extension to the well-known LEACH protocol to improve energy consumption in cluster-based WSNs. In addition to cluster formation according to LEACH protocol redundant nodes are grouped taking into account their redundancy and only a single node transmits data in each redundant group. This technique significantly improves the energy consumption and ensures a better end-to-end delay. Through intensive simulations, we discuss the performance of our approach and show how it outperforms the original LEACH protocol in terms of network lifetime and end-to-end delay.	end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;simulation;software deployment;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ibrahima Diane;Rahim Kacimi;Zoubir Mammeri;Ibrahima Niang	2013	6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)	10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548980	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	7.712756115153322	81.68764803337264	197917

Energy-aware routing schemes for wireless networks have spurred a great deal of recent research towards achieving this goal. Recently, an energy-aware routing protocol for MANETs was proposed by us, in which the energy load among nodes is balanced so that a minimum energy level is maintained and the resulting network lifetime is increased. In this paper, an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) inspired approach to EEAODR (so-called ACO-EEAODR) is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been made so far in this direction. The obtained simulation results show that the ACO-EEAODR outperforms the EEAODR scheme in terms of energy consumed and network lifetime performance metrics.	ant colony optimization algorithms;energy level;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);routing;simulation;swarm	Isaac Woungang;Mohammad S.

However, WAICs require extremely low failure probability for the flight certification of the safety-critical avionics applications. Existing industrial wireless networks are possible candidate technologies, since they are designed to meet the high reliability requirement of industrial automation within a harsh environment surrounded by metals. This letter provides a theoretical framework to compare the performance of representative industrial wireless networks against the system requirements of the flight certification. A mathematical model is proposed to evaluate the considered protocols in terms of the deadline missing probability per flight hour. Furthermore, the model is used to derive the maximum allowable packet loss probability while guaranteeing the flight certification.	automation;avionics;frequency band;mathematical model;network packet;requirement;system requirements	Pangun Park;Woohyuk Chang	2017	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2612188	embedded system;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;wireless site survey;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;packet loss;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	6.997413066071341	88.51420885229908	198006

Ideally, the broadcast process should be cancelled as soon as possible after a successful discovery, to avoid flooding the entire network. However, cancelling an ongoing broadcast is challenging and may increase the number of exchanged messages. In this paper, we compare the cancellation mechanisms used by BERS and BERS with new proposed cancellation approaches BCIR and BCIR. The formulation of a simplified analytical model and the simulation results show that: i) it is possible to reduce the number of retransmitted messages, without increasing the latency observed in BERS; and ii) BCIR is more energy efficient, which can contribute to extend the availability of mobile battery powered devices.	broadcast domain;simulation	Rui Lima;Carlos Baquero;Hugo Miranda	2013		10.1145/2480362.2480467	communications protocol;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	6.757742601827929	86.74841965735794	198193
9a612338db024a08eeb6d6f9cec0852e4ca4aaab	anatomizing the robustness of multichannel mac protocols for wsns: an evaluation under mac oriented design issues impacting qos		Abstract Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are single-channel based and mainly focus on energy-efficiency and scalability. Therefore, they may readily suffer from issues such as bandwidth insufficiency, interference, jamming and so on. With the deployment of dense sensor networks and the outset of multimedia technology, the intensity of the above-mentioned issues is further aggravated. To address those challenges, the researchers have employed multichannel technology in WSNs that focuses on increasing bandwidth/throughput while decreasing collision/congestion, delay, and energy consumption. For ascertaining a comprehensive exploration of multichannel technology in WSNs, this paper discusses in detail the important issues that are indispensable for providing high-performance and achieving Quality of Service (QoS) in multichannel WSNs. Further on, it evaluates a variety of multichannel MAC protocols under the stated design issues and classifies them into the categories Highly , Medium and Least-Robust , based upon aggregate-of-the-design-issues addressed by the corresponding multichannel MAC protocols for WSNs. Besides on the basis of channel access mechanism, each main category is sub-categorized into Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) , Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) , Composite and Other-Novel classes whereby the functionality of the MAC protocols belonging to each class is briefly discussed along with relevant pros u0026 cons. In addition to that, the survey delineates the implementation of the multichannel methodology in the emerging smart technologies of WSNs. In the end, future research directions are anticipated and a reasonable conclusion is put forth.		Waqas Rehan;Stefan Fischer;Maaz Rehan	2018	J.

The proposed algorithm aims at minimizing the identification delay, collision probabilities, and network overheads. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach and compared it to several reader collision solutions found in the literature such as NFRA, Dica and McMac. The results show that the proposed approach reduces reader collisions while minimizing the total interrogation time and the network overheads.	algorithm;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;run-time infrastructure (simulation);simulation	Christine Meguerditchian;Haïdar Safa;Wassim El-Hajj	2011	2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2011.6122220	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	8.581849854289459	87.84015933677729	198857

The proposed mobility model is inspired by the fish school, which takes into account several significant attractive/repulsive potential fields induced by the expected mobility, the tendency to avoid collisions, and the road constraints. With this model, we present a comprehensive approach for designing and analyzing the potential fields acting on connected vehicles. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, a theoretical analysis is also provided to show that the cooperative collision avoidance and stable constrained flocking of connected vehicles can be performed by using this model. The numerical experiments prove the effectiveness of the wireless communication on the safety and efficiency of connected vehicles.

c4ef3e42795df7f0b355e77fa642902e0fe06d63	network graph transformation providing fast calculation of paths for resilient routing		Protection of transmission against failures can be appropriately dealt with by alternative paths. However, common schemes (e.g., Bhandari's scheme) are characterized by a remarkable delay while determining the transmission paths. This in turn may have a serious impact on serving dynamic demands (characterized by relatively short duration time). As a remedy to this problem, we introduce an approach to pre-compute the sets of disjoint paths in advance to be able to start serving the demands once they have arrived. In particular, since the issue of establishing a set of node-disjoint paths is equivalent to the problem of determining the cheapest cycle in the network topology traversing the demand end nodes, we propose a generalization of this scheme assuming that any pair of node-disjoint paths can be obtained by means of merging a number of basic cycles defined for a network topology. The main contribution of this paper is the BCMP method of cheapest end-to-end cycles formation based on basic cycles, which, as verified for real network topologies, reduces up to 70% the time needed to establish node-disjoint paths in comparison with results obtained for the reference Bhandari's scheme.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;graph rewriting;network topology;norm (social);routing;simulation	Kanstantsin Myslitski;Jacek Rak;Lukasz Kuszner	2016	2016 8th International Workshop on Resilient Networks Design and Modeling (RNDM)	10.1109/RNDM.2016.7608293	routing;combinatorics;static routing;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;multipath routing	Arch	6.352828308223787	87.82380766356987	199395

Then, we investigate few MAC protocols devised for WBAN by emphasizing their salient features.

Mobility is one of the most characteristic in MANET, but it may cause the failure of a valid link. There are two repair mechanisms—local repair and source repair in Ad hoc on demand distance vector protocol (AODV). The source repair mechanisms will bring higher overhead and packet loss ratio. Local Repair is an effective way to rebuild a route to destination, but its performance decline when the destination is unreachable from local repair node. This paper proposes an improved repair mechanism (RE-AODV) based on the local repair scheme, which distinguishes different route request messages and route reply messages with Local_Repair and Dst_Answer flags, and process them with different priorities. The simulation results demonstrate that the network delivery ratio can be significantly improved by using the proposed repair scheme.	distance-vector routing protocol;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);simulation;unreachable memory	Xu Li;Qijing Feng;Shijie Li;Haiyang Ding	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.11.2467-2472	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.2350620661463085	83.51951383513159	199731
