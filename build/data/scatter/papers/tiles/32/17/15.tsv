A framework within which a number of location strategies can be placed is presented. Location-allocation models are improved in two ways: 1) the allocation rule is developed to more accurately reflect customer choice processe; and 2) the objective function is developed to incorporate future changes. Computational support for this framework is described.	computation;location-allocation;location-based service;loss function;optimization problem	John A. Keane;T. A. Ward	2002	IEEE Trans.

Perfect knowledge of a user's power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. It has been shown that an in-home energy storage system (such as a battery/inverter) that provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without inconvenience can also be used to hide a user's power usage pattern. A fundamental tradeoff exists between the costs saved and the degree of privacy achievable, and in this paper, the tradeoff achievable by a finite capacity battery assuming a zero tolerance for activity delay is studied using a Markov process model for user's demands and instantaneous electricity prices. Due to high computational complexity (continuous state-action space) of the stochastic control model, inner and upper bounds are presented on the optimal tradeoff. In particular, a class of battery charging policies based on minimizing revealing states is proposed to derive achievable privacy-cost savings tradeoff. The performance of this algorithm is compared with lower bounds derived using a greedy heuristic and upper bounds derived using an information theoretic rate distortion approach. The framework proposed is shown to be applicable even when users only desire partial information protection, such as presence/absence of activity or specific appliances they wish to hide. Numerical results based on real electricity and pricing data show that the proposed algorithm performs close to the upper bound demonstrating its efficacy.	battery charger;computational complexity theory;computer data storage;control system;distortion;greedy algorithm;heuristic;information security;marginal model;operating point;power inverter;privacy;process modeling;rate–distortion theory;requirement;stochastic control	Jiyun Yao;Parv Venkitasubramaniam	2014	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/CDC.2014.7039594	entropy;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;privacy;scheduling;random walk;utility;statistics	Embedded	3.293183287814649	2.995643025700668	149528
019bd664541906570449c41b8d1862e270da4725	minimal forecast horizons and a new planning procedure for the general dynamic lot sizing model: nervousness revisited	and sensitivity analysis;planning horizons;lot sizing;inventory production policies	We show for the general dynamic lot sizing model how minimal forecast horizons may be detected by a slight adaptation of an earlier 0(n log n) or 0(n) forward solution method for the model. A detailed numerical study indicates that minimal forecast horizons tend to be small, that is, include a small number of orders. We describe a new planning approach to ensure stability of the lot sizing decisions over an initial interval of time or stability horizon in those (relatively rare) cases where no planning horizon is detected or where the stability horizon extends beyond the planning horizon. To this end, we develop a heuristic, butfull horizon-based adaptation of the optimal lot sizing schedule, designed to minimize an upper bound for the worst-case optimality gap under the desired stability conditions. We also show how the basic horizon length n may be chosen to guarantee any prespecified positive optimality gap.	best, worst and average case;heuristic;numerical analysis	Awi Federgruen;Michal Tzur	1994	Operations Research	10.1287/opre.42.3.456	mathematical optimization;operations management;operations research	Robotics	3.9133540863523884	-2.0468778866115467	149905
3ddd6b32c5e4a01f35b1041a917956deed3520b1	the value of information and stochastic programming	value of information;stochastic programming	The problem of planning under uncertainty has many aspects; in this paper we consider the aspect that has to do with evaluating the state of information. We address ourselves to the question of how much better (i.e., how much more profitable) we could expect our plans to be if somehow we could know at planning time what the outcomes of the uncertain events will turn out to be. This expected increase in profitability is the “expected value of perfect information” and represents an upper bound to the amount of money that it would be worthwhile to spend in any survey or other investigation designed to provide that information beforehand. In many cases, the amount of calculation to compute an exact value is prohibitive. However, we derive bounds (estimates) for the value. Moreover, in the case of operations planning by linear or convex programming, we show how to evaluate these bounds as part of a post-optimal analysis.	stochastic programming	Mordecai Avriel;A. C.

Decisions are taken at different stages within the supply chain (Supply, Manufacturing & Distribution) and at different levels in the management hierarchy (Planning, Scheduling & Operations). They differ in business scope, time horizon & resolution, data certainty & accuracy, process detail and optimizing mechanism. Aligning each step of this complex process is critical to competitive advantage. Decision support tools must therefore be provided within a coherent framework. Including mechanisms which allow consistent economic and operational steering, taking due account of available (real-time) information on actual operations and market economics. At the strategic and global planning level for a network of manufacturing plants, decisions have to be taken on feedstock procurement & distribution, utilization of production capacities, utilization of modes of transport and demand allocation. Not only existing capabilities have to be considered but also new opportunities in all areas have to be evaluated. The resulting Mathematical Programming model is a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model: Integer aspects arise because of e.g. fixed costs / investment costs, tiered pricing and cargo costs. Non-linear relations are mainly caused by multiplication of quantityand economic-variables. In the presentation, the various strategic planning problem areas, the contents of the MINLP aspects and the implemented solution approach will be further elaborated. The use of such models during the aforementioned (strategic) decision taking process yields substantial benefits not only in economic terms but also in improved understanding of the interactions between the various components of the business.	automated planning and scheduling;coherence (physics);downstream (software development);interaction;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;procurement;programming model;real-time clock;scheduling (computing)	Winston Lasschuit;Nort Thijssen	2004	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2003.09.026	mathematical optimization;chemical industry;simulation;strategic planning;capacity utilization;systems engineering;engineering;management science;supply chain;competitive advantage;fixed cost	AI	9.500108964198997	-2.432090895212009	151456
52ebbab3deab1c76a941217742c6817776f6071a	a case study of maintenance service centre using simulation modelling approach	service centre;maintenance;servers;queuing theory;waiting time	A model is presented in this paper for maintenance service centers of electronic devices. This model is developed under the assumption that there are infinite customers having complaints in their appliances and limited number of service providers who will attend the complaints and take the appropriate action to rectify them. Service centers overcrowding represents a common characteristic that may affect the quality and efficiency of maintenance services. Analyzing the Service centers (SC) during the last one year we have observed a constant increasing of number of customers. For each SC it is a challenge to decrease the complaints’ waiting time, to provide timely repair and to improve the customer’s satisfaction. Long waiting times is the most important problem in customer’s satisfaction. We have asked many customers to get the idea of the most frequent problems, which are about the waiting time which is too long and the personnel which is insufficient. To manage these situations we will use queuing models which can provide reasonably accurate evaluations of our system’s performance. The results of this study can help us to understand the broader problem, the relationship between resources and waiting times, and to provide a solution to face the daily crisis.	simulation	Prachi Jain;Rashid Ali	2017	JoSSR	10.1007/s12927-017-0003-5	service provider;overcrowding;queueing theory;operations management;engineering;server	ECom	4.859325897749268	0.9018510717232561	151519

As the demand of Internet services and cloud computing keep increasing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations had been surging significantly. Such mass power consumption has brought heavy burden on IDC operators. Recently there are extensive research on power management for IDCs. However, one important challenge faced by IDC operators has been overlooked. How to handle the uncertainties in IDC operations is a challenging task. The uncertainties come from both the dynamic workload and time-varying electricity prices. In this paper, we systematically investigate the problem of minimizing the operation risk of IDCs against those uncertainties at the same time guaranteeing quality of service under deregulated electricity market environment. We propose a novel hedging scheme and model the operation risk minimization problem as a bilevel programming. We also design an optimal hedging algorithm. We conduct extensive evaluations based on real-life workload data from Google and electricity price data from deregulated electricity market for multiple IDC locations. Results show that our scheme can significantly reduce the operation risk by countering the uncertainties.	algorithm;cloud computing;data center;e-services;holism;load balancing (computing);power management;quality of service;real life;web service	Lei Rao;Xue Liu;Le Xie;Zhan Pang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2011.2159523	computer science;marketing;operations management;efficient energy use;bilevel optimization;forward contract;commerce	DB	2.896778940054835	2.721049338989448	151548

After the description of the protection system agai nst anomalous conditions, a brief failure mode anal ysis is performed in order to define the fault tree refe ring to compensator output voltage. An analytical model able to deal with non-exponential life and repair t ime distributions is developed, using semi-Markov processes and assuming stochastic independence for the components of the system under study. The mean time between failure ( MTBF) and the mean time to restoration ( MTTR) of the compensator output voltage are then calculated exactly. Finally a mechanical bypass switch, which connects the load to the mains directly during long failures , is taken into account in the MTBF calculation via a simple approximation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate t h results of the analytical model and of the approximation.	approximation;bypass switch;circuit restoration;comstock–needham system;failure cause;fault tree analysis;ibm power systems;markov property;mean time between failures;mean time to recovery;monte carlo method;reliability engineering;semiconductor industry;simulation;stochastic process;time complexity;ups (debugger)	Antonio Pievatolo;Ivan Valadè	2003	Rel.

93b23a86bbaf123d4ac0f4ab020560e36c7bb4a3	optimal replacement policy for a repairable system with deterioration based on a renewal-geometric process		The optimal replacement policy is proposed for a new maintenance model of a repairable deteriorating system to minimize the average cost rate throughout the system life cycle. It is assumed that the system undergoes deterioration with an increasing trend of deterioration probability after each repair. More specifically, a novel maintenance model is first presented based on a new defined renewal-geometric process, which splits the operation process into an early renewal process and a late geometric process to characterize such a special deterioration delay. Then, the average cost rate for the new model is formulated according to the renewal-reward theorem. Next, a theorem is presented to derive the theoretical relationships of optimal replacement policies for the geometric-process maintenance model and the new proposed model, respectively. Finally, numerical examples suggest that the optimum values can be determined to minimize the average cost rates.	numerical analysis;system lifecycle	Caiyun Niu;Xiaolin Liang;Bingfeng Ge;Xue Tian;Yingwu Chen	2016	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-016-2133-4	operations management	EDA	6.870964434166552	-1.1073082938260936	155837

The proportion of grade one units produced in a lot is a random variable assumed to follow the lognormal distribution. Demands for grade 2 may be filled with grade 1 product, but not vice versa. Assuming that demands for the two grades are known and constant, we develop a continuous review model in which cycles are defined as times when total inventory equals zero. Since grade 1 inventory may be depleted before total stock and shortages are not permitted, cycles may consist of multiple set-ups. We show that the optimal order-to-point, S, has a form similar to the EOQ.

A general heuristic can be driven from this proof that states: start with the most difficult task when dealing with complex problems. We also show that modularization and subassembly formation can reduce the cost saving effects of task sequencing. The paper illustrates the importance of considering task modularization prior to task sequencing for complex assemblies.	assembly language;computability;heuristic	Michael J.

7783e522ed2a682afa325ddd1f8815e2a0fddb57	simulation-based multiple automated guided vehicles considering charging and collision-free requirements in automatic warehouse		The deployment of automated guided vehicles in the automated warehouse has a great impact on the capacity in handling logistics activities. Simulation offers practical feedback and analytical solution at a designing stage of engineering applications. As for automated warehouse system, the optimal set of the combination of automated guided vehicles and workstations are highly depended on the size, dimensions, layout structure of the warehouse and working process. In this paper, the operations in the automatic warehouse were simulated to determine possible scenarios of the warehouse setting regarding the demand pattern of the packaging order. In the automatic warehouse, the racks are transferred by the automated guided vehicles to the workstations. The contribution of the study is that it not only considers the optimal number of AGV but also the optimal number of workstation for automatic warehouse. To estimate the possible setting with the highest order turn-over rate, varies scenarios were considered in the model. As a result, the estimated layout and warehouse setting were suggested.		C. K.

493c7c29697ce6b12554fa700cacfacc02fe101f	optimal hour-ahead bidding in the real-time electricity market with battery storage using approximate dynamic programming	hour ahead;energy storage;bidding;real time market;approximate dynamic programming	There is growing interest in the use of grid–level storage to smooth variations in supply that are likely to arise with increased use of wind and solar energy. Energy arbitrage, the process of buying, storing, and selling electricity to exploit variations in electricity spot prices, is becoming an important way of paying for expensive investments into grid–level storage. Independent system operators such as the NYISO (New York Independent System Operator) require that battery storage operators place bids into an hour–ahead market (although settlements may occur in increments as small as 5 minutes, which is considered near “real–time”). The operator has to place these bids without knowing the energy level in the battery at the beginning of the hour, while simultaneously accounting for the value of leftover energy at the end of the hour. The problem is formulated as a dynamic program. We describe and employ a convergent approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that exploits monotonicity of the value function to find a revenue–generating bidding policy; using optimal benchmarks, we empirically show the computational benefits of the algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a distribution–free variant of the ADP algorithm that does not require any knowledge of the distribution of the price process (and makes no assumptions regarding a specific real–time price model). We demonstrate that a policy trained on historical real–time price data from the NYISO using this distribution–free approach is indeed effective.	approximation algorithm;bellman equation;computation;computational resource;dynamic programming;energy level;fo (complexity);heuristic;iteration;iterative method;logic programming;markov decision process;material design;nl (complexity);optimization problem;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sysop;time complexity;usb on-the-go;monotone	Daniel R.

We present a stochastic optimization model of the power system which captures interactions of decisions at these two timescales through a novel state-variable formulation. The model also includes transmission constraints approximated by a linearized dc network, fast response operating reserves, and renewable generation. To tackle this high-dimensional multistage stochastic optimization problem, we present a sequential sampling method which we refer to as the stochastic dynamic linear programming. This algorithm is a dynamic extension of regularized two-stage stochastic decomposition for stagewise independent multistage stochastic linear programs, and is targeted at the class of problems where decisions are made at two different timescales. We compare our algorithm with the stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) which has been effectively applied in planning power systems operations. Our computational results show that our sequential Monte-Carlo approach provides prescriptive solutions and values which are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained from SDDP, while improving computational times significantly.	approximation algorithm;clustered file system;computation;dynamic programming;experiment;ibm power systems;interaction;linear programming formulation;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;multistage amplifier;online and offline;optimization problem;program optimization;sampling (signal processing);scalability;simulation;stochastic gradient descent;stochastic optimization;stochastic process;sysop	Harsha Gangammanavar;Suvrajeet Sen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2616881	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science	ML	4.4633260252948705	3.965485304778919	159106

Several studies indicate an average Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of around 55% in manufacturing industry. One major reason is machine downtime leading to substantial system losses culminating in production plans with unsatisfactory robustness. This paper discusses an approach to integrate maintenance strategies into a production planning approach using discrete event simulation. The aim is to investigate how and where in the planning process maintenance strategies can be integrated and how different maintenance strategies influence production performance and the overall robustness of production plans. The approach is exemplified in an automotive case study, integrating strategies for reactive maintenance in a simulation model to support decision making on how repair orders should be prioritized to increase production performance. The results show that introducing priority-based planning of maintenance activities has a potential to increase productivity by approximately 5%.	downtime;simulation	Maheshwaran Gopalakrishnan;Anders Skoogh;Christoph Laroque	2013	2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)		maintenance engineering;simulation;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;discrete event simulation;production engineering;manufacturing engineering	AI	9.224938550867527	1.4129477207204477	160138

As a result, there is little doubt that energy from wind will be a significant contribution to the electricity portfolio of the future. Due to the sensitivity of the network and the volatility of the wind resource, analysis of power system operations using expected wind generation is not representative of actual system operations. In order to account for this fundamental uncertainty in wind generation, a Monte Carlo simulation model is developed based on an Optimal Power Flow model, and tested on the IEEE 39-bus test system. The results of these simulations indicate that while the average cost of serving load decreases with increasing wind penetration, the reliability of the system is highly sensitive to the ability of other generators on the system to ramp production either up or down on very short timescales.	fossil;monte carlo method;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;volatility	C.

In order to complete the project by the desired date with a certain confidence, the variable times or branching probabilities should be designed appropriately. In this paper, we will propose a new planning method for the branching probabilities to realize the desired project duration. We usually represent project processes as stochastic networks, such as GERT. In realistic projects, we must analyze generalized complex GERT networks. In this case, analytical treatment is difficult because of the network complexity. Monte Carlo simulation is a practical technique for complex GERT networks. The project duration is determined based on the variable-time and the branching-probability for each arrow. By our former method, we can estimate the project duration efficiently by analyzing the times and probabilities by the combination use of Monte Carlo simulation and probability theory. However, the reverse problems are difficult to be solved; that is, it is difficult for us to find branching probabilities that can realize the desired project duration. We propose a planning method for branching probabilities to realize the desired project duration using genetic algorithm technique supported by Monte Carlo simulation.

13ab416860a808bab0bf953520447f763faed9ce	selective maintenance optimization when quality of imperfect maintenance actions are stochastic	reliability;preventive maintenance;selective maintenance;stochastic optimization	This paper addresses the selective maintenance optimization problem in a multi-component system, carrying out several missions with scheduled intermission breaks. To improve the probability of the system successfully completing the next mission, maintenance is performed on the system’s components during the break. Each component is assigned a list of eligible maintenance actions ranging from minimal repair, through intermediate imperfect maintenance actions, to replacement. The quality of a maintenance action is assumed to be stochastic, reflecting the degree of expertise of the repairman and the tools used to perform the maintenance action. This quality is thus treated as a random variable with an identified probability distribution. The selective maintenance problem aims thus at finding a cost-optimal subset of maintenance actions, to be performed on the system during the limited duration of the break, which guarantees that the pre-set minimum probability of successfully completing the next mission is attained. The fundamental constructs and the relevant parameters of this nonlinear and stochastic optimization problem are developed and thoroughly discussed. It is then put into practice for a series-parallel system and the added value of solving it as a stochastic problem is demonstrated on some test cases.	cost efficiency;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;series-parallel graph;stochastic optimization;stochastic process;test case	Abdelhakim Khatab;El Houssaine Aghezzaf	2016	Rel.

The system can fail due to two causes of failure: the failure due to accumulated wear and that due to the catastrophic failure. We analyze the dependence structure of the two competing failure modes. Based on these properties, we develop a maintenance strategy for such system and study the optimal maintenance policy which minimizes the long-run average cost rate.	optimal maintenance;tree accumulation	Ji Hwan Cha;Carmen Sangüesa;Inmaculada Torres Castro	2016	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2016.2570558	reliability engineering;real-time computing	Embedded	6.747439404341737	-1.142077304353194	164154

Here, the goal is to improve the efficiency of the system while reducing the cost of maintenance and risk of failure. Traditionally, asset management has been performed as time-based maintenance or corrective maintenance; however, in order to reduce the consequences of component failures on the operation of the overall system many plant managers have moved towards more advanced condition-based or reliability-centric maintenance techniques. Here, the asset manager would adopt a more proactive maintenance approach based on the condition of the component and its importance for the overall production plan. Although shutting down a process for maintenance purposes has long-term benefits, it may accrue costs associated with the lost revenue, inventory buildup or wasted labor. A solution is put forth in this paper that counteracts financial losses due to preventive maintenance with direct benefits gained from demand response (DR). Within this context, maintenance scheduling is coordinated with DR, which is used as a tool at the asset manger's disposal in order to offset these financial losses. A case study is presented for a sample industrial plant in order to further explain the design concepts.	floor and ceiling functions;physical plant;scheduling (computing)	Salman Mohagheghi;Neda Raji	2014	2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2014.6978371	proactive maintenance;reliability engineering;planned maintenance;systems engineering;operations management;computerized maintenance management system;monitoring maintenance lifecycle;business;predictive maintenance	Embedded	7.493613804870247	-1.4573988242540274	165020

In the Spanish case, this schedule includes two main concepts: energy production (to be actually produced) and secondary reserve (to maintain available). The generation company faces the problem of converting energy schedule into a power schedule, respecting the reserve schedule as well as technical constraints, and trying to accomplish different goals: to minimise the production costs, to obtain smooth shapes for the power schedules and to optimise eventual compensation in schedules. A weighted goal mixed integer programming model with a real-size application to deal with this problem is presented.	eventual consistency;goal programming;integer programming;linear programming;programming model	E.

The inventory is replenished according to an (s, S) policy and the lead time is assumed to follow a discrete phase-type distribution. The demands that occur during stock-out periods either enter a pool which has a finite capacity N(<∞) or leave the system with a predefined probability. Any demand that arrives when the pool is full and the inventory level is zero, is assumed to be lost. The demands in the pool are selected one by one, if the on-hand inventory level is above s+ 1, and the interval time between any two successive selections is assumed to have discrete phase-type distribution. The joint probability distribution of the number of customers in the pool and the inventory level is obtained in the steady state case. The measures of system performance in the steady state are derived and the total expected cost rate is also calculated. The results are illustrated numerically. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, a practical method is introduced for the selection of a suitable system elements maintenance strategy; moreover, to plan the preventive maintenance budget for the system elements, two methods are offered: the cost optimization method and the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. In the former method, a new model of system maintenance cost is offered. This model, based on system outage information, the elements maintenance costs are determined as functions of system reliability indices and preventive maintenance budget. The latter method, too, a new guideline is introduced for considering the cost and reliability criteria in the trend of preventive maintenance budget planning. In this method, the preventive maintenance budget for the elements is determined based on relative priority of elements with reliability criteria. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

6c58aa24cd6f91b76d794dcf4d99b88c5c932e17	energy consumption scheduling of hvac considering weather forecast error through the distributionally robust approach		In this paper, the distributionally robust optimization approach (DROA) is proposed to schedule the energy consumption of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system with consideration of the weather forecast error. The maximum interval of the outdoor temperature is partitioned into subintervals, and the proposed DROA constructs the ambiguity set of the probability distribution of the outdoor temperature based on the probabilistic information of these subintervals of historical weather data. The actual energy consumption will be adjusted according to the forecast error and the scheduled consumption in real time. The energy consumption scheduling of HVAC through the proposed DROA is formulated as a nonlinear problem with distributionally robust chance constraints. These constraints are reformulated to be linear and then the problem is solved via linear programming. Compared with the method that takes into account the weather forecast error based on the mean and the variance of historical data, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DROA effectively reduces the electricity cost with less computation time, and the electricity cost is reduced compared with the traditional robust method.

In day-ahead scheduling, with the distributional information of wind generation and energy demands, decisions on the optimal procurement of conventional energy supply and the day-ahead retail price are made; in real-time scheduling, with the realization of wind generation, the load of traditional energy users, the real-time prices are announced to manage the demand of opportunistic energy users so as to achieve system-wide reliability. Focusing on the case when the opportunistic energy users are persistent, i.e., they stay in the system until a real-time retail price is acceptable, we formulate the scheduling problem as a multi-timescale Markov decision process with special characteristics. We then show that it can be recast, explicitly, as a classic Markov decision process with continuous state and action spaces, the solution to which can be found via standard techniques.	ibm power systems;markov chain;markov decision process;markov model;persistence (computer science);procurement;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing)	Miao He;Sugumar Murugesan;Junshan Zhang	2011	2011 4th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2011.6135903	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;simulation;operations management;business	Embedded	3.3371290190821203	4.15138304959035	169802

A nite state Markov process describes the mission process. The age or deterioration process of the system is described by another nite state Markov process whose generator depends on the phases of the mission. We discuss optimal replacement and optimal repair problems and characterize the optimal policies under some monotonicity assumptions. We also provide numerical illustrations to demonstrate the structure of the optimal policies. Key words: Optimal maintenance, mission-based system, Markovian deterioration 1. Introduction Maintenance actions are vital for companies to increase reliability and availability of the production system and to decrease production costs. A signicant portion of the total work force of a company is employed in maintenance departments and a great amount of money is spent for maintenance by companies every year. Therefore, optimal maintenance problems which address the obvious trade-o¤ between maintenance costs and productivity are very important for both researchers and company managers. In this study, we analyze optimal replacement and repair problems for systems which are designed to perform missions consisting of di¤erent stages or phases. Such systems are called mission-based systems or phased-mission systems in the literature. The sequence and the duration of the phases can be deterministic or random, and all failure properties of the components as well as the conguration of the system change dramatically from phase to phase. These kind of systems were rst introduced as phased-mission systems by Esary and Ziehms (1975) and a vast literature has accumulated since then. There are various models that involve systems with repairable and non-repairable components with deterministic or random phase durations and sequences. We refer the reader to Veatch (1986), Kim and Park (1994), Mura and Bondavalli (2001) and references cited in these papers for di¤erent models. We assume that the mission process is a Markov process. In other words, the system under consideration performs a mission whose successive phases follow a Markov chain and all phase durations are exponentially distributed. We also assume that the system is subject to Markovian Corresponding Author.

In other words, the successive deterioration levels of the system follow a Markov chain and holding times in each deterioration level are exponentially distributed during any phase. The most important point is that the generator of the deterioration process of the system (the transition probability matrix and rates of the holding times) depends on the mission process. This implies that the deterioration process is a Markov process modulated by another Markov process (i.e., the mission process). We characterize optimal replacement and repair policies which minimize the expected total discounted cost by considering phase dependent maintenance costs and state occupancy costs. Optimal maintenance of systems subject to Markovian deterioration has been studied extensively in OR literature. One of the earliest and basic models where the deterioration process is described by a Markov chain is analyzed by Derman (1970). It is shown that the optimal policies minimizing both expected total discounted cost and expected average cost are controllimit type under some monotonicity assumptions on the costs and the deterioration process. In particular, there exists a critical deterioration level above which the optimal decision is replace and below which the optimal decision is do nothing. The same model with sate occupancy costs incurred each time that the system is inspected is analyzed by Kolesar (1966) and the optimality of a control-limit policy is proved. A similar model with state dependent replacement costs is analyzed in Kawai et al. (2002). A generalization of the model in Kolesar (1966) is analyzed in Wood (1988) by considering the case where the replacement action may fail with some probability and the occupancy costs are not paid during replacement. The analysis is done by applying uniformization techniques by which a continuous-time Markov decision process can be converted into an equivalent discrete-time Markov decision process. The optimal policy is control-limit type provided that model parameters satisfy some monotonicity conditions. Özekici and Günlük (1992) provide some su¢ cient conditions which make the lifetime of a system with Markovian deterioration increasing failure rate on average (IFRA), and also show that these conditions imply the optimality of a control-limit policy if the replacement cost does not depend on the deterioration level of the system. They also analyze optimal repair problems considering several di¤erent cost structures. In a related work, Özekici (1995) considers the maintenance problem of a device operating in a random environment and provides characterizations of optimal maintenance policies when the device ages intrinsically. In most of the literature, it is generally assumed that the system is working under a xed environment or phase. Therefore, this study extends this line of research by examining systems with Markovian deterioration modulated by an external mission process. For more information on optimal maintenance problems, the interested readers are referred to the surveys by Jardine and Buzacott (1985), Cho and Parlar (1991), Wang (2002), and Nicolai and Dekker (2007). In Section 2, we describe the stochastic structure of the mission and deterioration processes in detail. We analyze the optimal replacement problem in Section 3. In Section 4, the optimal repair problem is discussed and some special repair cost structures are further analyzed in Section 5. A number of illustrations are also provided in the Appendix. 2.

Our objective is to study the effect of an unforeseen extension of subcontracting duration on a production system provider of subcontracting services. We will study a system with a production unit M subject to corrective maintenance actions, a result of random breakdowns. We perform a preventive maintenance action (PM) for each time T. Corrective and preventive maintenance have random durations. A buffer stock S with a capacity h, is built up with a production rate U in order to satisfy the constant demand d of the principal costumer, such as U""""m""""a""""x>d. We note @a=U""""m""""a""""x-d, the maximum stock accumulation rate. In addition, the machine M is allocated to perform subcontracting tasks (ST) to a contractor production system, at each moment A""""1, for a useful duration A""""2, during which it is unavailable for our system. Thus, the machine must satisfy at the same time the constant demand (under a costumer-supplier relationship) and subcontracting tasks (under a contractor-subcontractor relationship). In this context, a mathematical model is developed to determine the impact of an unforeseen extension of subcontracting duration on the generated costs. We will determine the optimal values of T and h and we will discuss the impact of the extension of a ST with @q time units."""	production system (computer science)	Mohammed Dahane;Christian Clementz;Nidhal Rezg	2010	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2009.08.007	reliability engineering;preventive maintenance;inventory;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management;mathematical model;production system;satisfiability	SE	6.091608712188283	-1.2188605604027758	170716

The latter is a function of component age during a system’s operating life. Component aging is strongly affected by maintenance activities performed on the system. In this work, we consider two categories of maintenance activities: corrective maintenance (CM) and preventive maintenance (PM). Maintenance actions are characterized by their ability to reduce this age. PM consists of actions applied on components while they are operating, whereas CM actions occur when the component breaks down. In this paper, we expound a new method to integrate the effect of CM while planning for the PM policy. The proportional hazard function was used as a modeling tool for that purpose. Interesting results were obtained when comparison between policies that take into consideration the CM effect and those that do not is established. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast with the existing models in the literature, we take into account the supplier s availability in characterizing the lead time of a replenishment order. Assuming that the supplier s availability can be described by a continuous-time homogeneous Markov chain with two states (on and off) and that stockouts are lost, we derive the stationary distribution of the inventory level (stock-on-hand) under an (s, Q)type control policy. This probability distribution is then used to formulate an exact expression for the long-run average cost per unit time of operating the inventory system.

Two standard capacities of FOUPs are 25 and 13 wafers. This paper describes a simulation study designed to compare the performance of a factory employing different FOUP capacities. The main performance measure considered is work-in-process (WIP) and the resulting cycle time. Batching policy, order arrival rate, average order size, the Automated Material Handling System (AMHS) and the number of batch tools largely effect the performance of the models. Most of the empirical results show that the 25-wafer FOUP capacity provides a lower WIP level in a moderately loaded semiconductor factory.	digital modeling and fabrication;foup;material handling;queueing theory;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation;symposium on principles of database systems	Kranthi Mitra Adusumilli;Robert L.

Unless m is small, the computations quickly become unreasonable. By bounding the expected outdating function and using an approximate transfer function, we obtain an approximation of the original problem that can be computed as if the lifetime were r < m periods. When r = 2, it is demonstrated under reasonable assumptions that the appropriate function to be minimized each period is quasi-convex. We include computations that compare this approximation to both the optimal policy and a critical number approximation.	approximation	Steven Nahmias	1977	Operations Research	10.1287/opre.25.4.630	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;higher-order logic;mathematics;mathematical economics	DB	2.9733063999205465	-2.829630364254829	172760

For the systems under consideration, there is a one-for-one replenishment policy that is generally valid for relatively expensive, infrequently demanded, repairable items (Graves, 1985; Sherbrooke, 1986). Under this model, when the customer’s system fails, an item is removed and replaced to restore the system to full operational capability. Such a replacement can only be accomplished if a spare is available at the operational site at the time of system failure. The frequency under which this particular item is needed to restore system capability in any fixed interval of length t is defined as the expected item demand rate of item i at location l within echelon e, E1⁄2N i ðtÞ . As per Assumption 1, a homogeneous Poisson process describes the number of demands (system failures).	algorithm;computation;lateral computing;lateral thinking;operations research;row echelon form	David R.

This was counterintuitive since the operators already had significant idle time. Yet time studies confirmed that bottleneck equipment for which these operators were responsible was spending over 22% of its uptime idle solely due to lack of an operator. Analysis showed how this could be so: production equipment has a frequent and unpredictable need for operators, yet the operators must spend time away from the equipment tending to other demands of their jobs. A method of estimating the cost of this operator-induced throughput loss is described. The result shows how extremely profitable the hiring of extra operators is in such situations.

In the case of a bare die assembly, it is often highly desirable to use either Known Good Die (KGD) or die that have been burned-in and tested to the same level of quality and reliability as their packaged die equivalents. However, performing full bare die burn-in and test may not always be cost-effective. This paper examines the question of whether it is always necessary to use KGD to produce a cost-effective multichip module (MCM) of acceptable quality. A process-flow based cost model is used to compare the cost and quality of MCMs assembled with KGD to MCMs assembled with die that have received wafer-level test only. In addition to test effectiveness at the wafer, die, and module level, factors that are considered include die complexity (size and I/O), number of die per MCM, the cost of producing the KGD, and rework costs and effectiveness. The cost model captures inputs from wafer fabrication through MCM assembly and rework. Monte Carlo simulation is used to account for uncertainty in the input data. The resulting sensitivity analyses give final MCM cost and quality as a function of the various factors for both KGD and die that have received wafer-level test only.		Cynthia F. Murphy;Magdy S.

J. Oper. Res. 171(2):557–566, 2006) presented a production-inventory system for deteriorating items with demand rate being a linearly ramp type function of time and production rate being proportional to the demand rate. The two models without shortages and with shortages were discussed. Both models were studied assuming that the time point at which the demand is stabilized occurs before the production stopping time. In this paper, we complete this model by considering that: (a) for the model with no shortages; the demand rate is stabilized after the production stopping time and (b) for the model with shortages; the demand rate is stabilized after the production stopping time or after the time when the inventory level reaches zero or after the production restarting time. In addition, we extend the work of Manna and Chaudhuri (Eur. J. Oper. Res. 171(2):557–566, 2006) assuming a general function of time for the variable part of the demand rate.	emoticon;inventory theory;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability	Konstantina Skouri;Ioannis Konstantaras;Swapan Kumar Manna;K.

Essentially, the design of sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes is an optimization problem with several constraints, usually related to the quality levels required by the producer and the consumer. An optimal acceptance sampling plan is developed in this paper for the Weibull distribution with unknown scale parameter. The proposed plan combines grouping of items, sudden death testing in each group and progressive group removals, and its decision criterion is based on the uniformly most powerful life test. A mixed integer programming problem is first solved for determining the minimum number of failures required and the corresponding acceptance constant. The optimal number of groups is then obtained by minimizing a balanced estimation of the expected test cost. Excellent approximately optimal solutions are also provided in closed-forms. The sampling plan is considerably flexible and allows to save experimental time and cost. In general, our methodology achieves solutions that are quite robust to small variations in the Weibull shape parameter. A numerical example about a manufacturing process of gyroscopes is included for illustration.	mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing)	Arturo J. Fernández;Carlos J.

Shortages are permitted and a fraction of them is backlogged. Capacity and service level are limitations of the production system. It is assumed that preventive maintenance can be performed when the inventory level is positive or negative. Indeed two different scenarios are modeled and according to the comparisons between their costs, a new scenario according to the best time of preventive maintenance is investigated and modeled. The aim of this research is to determine the best time for preventive maintenance, production and back-ordered quantities of each item and common cycle length, such that the expected total cost is minimized. The objective function of the final proposed model is proved to be convex and closed-form optimal solutions are derived. Two numerical examples based on a real application of the proposed model in a turning manufactory with only one computer numerical control machine applied to lathe metal plates to different sizes are used to illustrate the applicability of extended model and proposed solution method.	scrum (software development)	Ata Allah Taleizadeh	2018	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-017-2563-7	mathematics;mathematical optimization;total cost;economic shortage;economic production quantity;rework;preventive maintenance;inventory control;service level	AI	8.70090716751068	0.5055169093810961	175615

Under a certain cost function that takes into account the trade-o¤ between the transferal set-up costs, the proportional holding and unsatisfied demand costs, the control policy of ‘‘when’’ and ‘‘how much’’ to transfer is restricted to the case of clearings under conditions of sporadic review. The objective is to find the optimal production rate or the optimal rate of the clearing process in heavy tra‰c in both locations. The purpose of this study is two-fold: we are interested both in the performance analysis of the relevant cost functionals and also in optimization and sensitivity analysis.	inventory theory;loss function;mathematical optimization	Oded Berman;Dmitry Krass;David Perry	2003	Math.

For such systems, warranty cost is subject to all the factors including system configuration, quality of each component and the extent of failure dependence among components. In this paper, a model is developed based on renewing free-replacement warranty by considering failure interaction among components. It is assumed that whenever a component (subsystem) fails, it can induce a failure of one or more of the remaining components (subsystems). Cost models for series and parallel system configurations are presented, followed by numerical examples with sensitivity analysis. The results show that, compared with series systems, warranty cost for parallel systems is more sensitive to failure interaction.	complex systems;failure cause;numerical analysis;system configuration	Bin Liu;Jun Wu;Min Xie	2015	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2015.01.030	operations management	SE	7.703323571079415	-1.055272687246116	176172

Items in stock are assumed to belong to one of a finite number of quality classes that are ordered in such a way that Class 1 contains the best quality and the last class contains the pre-perishable quality. By the end of each epoch, items in each inventory class either stay in the same class or lose quality and move to a lower class. The movement between classes is not observed. Samples are drawn from the inventory and based on the observations of these samples, optimal estimates for the number of items in each quality classes are derived.	epoch (reference date);inventory theory;recursion (computer science);sampling (signal processing)	Lakhdar Aggoun;Lakdere Benkherouf;Ali Benmerzouga	2003	JAMDS	10.1155/S1173912603000208	inventory control;optimal estimation;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;simulation;economics;operations management;mathematics;hidden markov model	ML	4.904331352255987	-0.9929299012537404	176291

Inadequate assignment of gates may result in flight delays that happen in airport operations and must be taken into account. Here, we are using the original algorithm, based on Markov decision process (MDP) to solve the gate assignment problem (GAP) under uncertainty; we include stochastic parameters that depend on probabilities to express fluctuations in flight operations. The use of MDP for modeling will provide for airport controllers a robust solution for the GAP that takes in consideration possible flight delays. This paper gives the corresponding model, which includes strict constraints of the GAP and other soft constraints like choice preferences of gates. We give experimental results on a sample of real data to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.	algorithm;assignment problem;iteration;iterative method;markov chain;markov decision process;simulation;stochastic modelling (insurance)	Oussama Aoun;Abdellatif El Afia	2014	2014 International Conference on Logistics Operations Management	10.1109/GOL.2014.6887445	markov decision process;mathematical optimization;simulation;partially observable markov decision process;engineering;operations management;markov model	EDA	9.497468037694903	-0.807410714766106	176417
dd0713481e302247089726fede7a8353d9f091d6	incorporating risk in field services operational planning process		This paper presents a model for the risk minimisation objective in the Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem (SVRP). In the studied variant of SVRP, service times and travel times are subject to stochastic events, and a time window is constraining the start time for service task. Required skill levels and task priorities increase the complexity of this problem. Most previous research uses a chance-constrained approach to the problem and their objectives are related to traditional routing costs whilst a different approach was taken in this paper. The risk of missing a task is defined as the probability that the technician assigned to the task arrives at the customer site later than the time window. The problem studied in this paper is to generate a schedule that minimises the maximum of risks and sum of risks over all the tasks considering the effect of skill levels and task priorities. The stochastic duration of each task is supposed to follow a known normal distribution. However, the distribution of the start time of the service at a customer site will not be normally distributed due to time window constraints. A method is proposed and tested to approximate the start time distribution as normal. Moreover, a linear model can be obtained assuming identical variance of task durations. Additionally Simulated Annealing method was applied to solve the problem. Results of this work have been applied to an industrial case of SVRP where field engineering individuals drive to customer sites to provide time-constrained services. This original approach gives a robust schedule and allows organisations to pay more attention to increasing customer satisfaction and become more competitive in the market.

When the number of such calls is contractually limited, then the issue of optimally dispatching the calls must be addressed. In this paper, an algorithm for optimally dispatching interruptible and curtailable I/C service options is developed within a stochastic dynamic programming SDP framework. The solution yields thresholds for calling load curtailments as a function of: 1 the number of days remaining in the period, 2 the available number of interruptions, and 3 the level of uncertainty regarding future price and cost fluctuations. The SDP approach also provides a framework for optimally designing the I/C program parameters. An illustration of the dispatching routine is provided using data from Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation NMPC. The algorithm developed in the paper is currently being employed by NMPC as part of its I/C program for industrial and commercial customers.		Douglas W. Caves;Joseph A.

In these models, the decision-making horizon can be partitioned into intervals, called slow scale cycles, of N +1 epochs. The transition law and reward function are time-homogeneous over the first N epochs of each slow scale cycle, but distinct at the final epoch. The motivation for such models is in applications where decisions of different nature are taken at different time scales, i.e., many “low-level” decisions are made between less frequent “high-level” ones. For the PTMDP model, we consider the problem of optimizing the expected discounted reward when rewards devalue by a discount factor at the beginning of each slow scale cycle. When N is large, initially stationary policies (i.s.p.’s) are natural candidates for optimal policies. Similar to turnpike policies, an initially stationary policy uses the same decision rule for some large number of epochs in each slow scale cycle, followed by a relatively short planning horizon of time-varying decision rules. In this paper, we characterize the form of the optimal value as a function of N , establish conditions ensuring the existence of near-optimal i.s.p.’s, and characterize their structure. Our analysis deals separately with the cases where the time-homogeneous part of the system has state-dependent and state-independent optimal average reward. As we illustrate, the results in these two distinct cases are qualitatively different.	aperiodic graph;epoch (reference date);high- and low-level;level of detail;like button;list of code lyoko episodes;markov chain;markov decision process;optimization problem;quasiperiodicity;reinforcement learning;scalability;stationary process	Matthew W.

A novel forward-moving quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation technique in conjunction with backward-moving dynamic programming is introduced. At any time, when commitment decision can be made, it is relied upon the present realization of electricity and fuel prices. The decision whether to turn the unit “on” or “off” is equivalent in term of expected profit, when the electricity and fuel prices are on the “locus” or known as indifference locus (IL). The identification of the ILs is a crucial step in unit asset valuation method. A least-squares polynomial based technique to approximate the continuous path of ILs was used to further improve the simulation speed without compromising its accuracy. The quasi-Monte Carlo coupled with least-squares polynomial for constructing ILs represent a new approach to solve unit asset valuation problem. Testing and model verification were performed. They indicate that the proposed technique is significantly faster while producing accurate results. It reduces the computational burden by more than 3,000 times while results are of a 0.13% error level.	24-hour clock;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;dynamic programming;locus;least squares;monte carlo method;polynomial;quantum monte carlo;quasi-monte carlo method;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;recursion;speedup;time complexity;value (ethics)	Nur Sisworahardjo	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021556	financial management;econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	SE	4.451344559473261	2.8223466211920534	178998
8479eb8f40b0cad8b79cea30e17a7503b28c58cc	periodic and sequential preventive maintenance policies over a finite planning horizon with a dynamic failure law	periodic maintenance;finite horizon;optimization;sequential maintenance	The purpose of this study is to propose and model periodic and sequential preventive maintenance policies for a system that performs various missions over a finite planning horizon. Each mission can have different characteristics that depend on operational and environmental conditions. These proposed preventive maintenance policies are defined and modeled mathematically. The study of these two policies is based on a dynamic system failure law that takes into account the different missions performed. The first step is to determine the optimal business plan to achieve, i.e. the set of missions to perform in order to maximize the profit of missions minus maintenance costs. Thus, for each plan, we determine the maintenance planning considering two policies. The first preventive maintenance policy is periodic and the objective is to determine the optimal number of preventive maintenance to achieve. For the second policy, namely sequential, we calculate the optimal number of preventive maintenance intervals and the duration of these different intervals.	dynamical system;fitts's law;genetic algorithm;great deluge algorithm;metaheuristic;numerical analysis;proportional hazards model;weatherstar	Jérémie Schutz;Nidhal Rezg;Jean-Baptiste Léger	2011	J.

In ToU modalities, a set of different tariffs for different hours of the day and/or seasons of the year is defined at the beginning of a given horizon, and then kept constant until its end. While designing ToU tariffs, one of the most significant sources of uncertainty to be considered relates to price-elasticities of demand. We propose an approach for ToU tariff design based in quadratically constrained quadratic programming and stochastic optimization techniques, addressing these uncertainties and dealing with various aspects of tariff design from the point of view of the regulator/regulated utility.	expected shortfall;hash table;load (computing);loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program;riskmetrics;robust optimization;sampling (signal processing);stochastic optimization;value at risk	Rafael de Sa Ferreira;Luiz Augusto N.

In most real-life production processes, generation of defective items and breakdowns of manufacturing equipment are inevitable. In this study, random defective rate is assumed and all manufactured items are screened. The perfect quality, reworkable and scrap items are identified and separated; failure-in-rework is assumed. The system is also subject to random machine breakdown; and when it occurs, the AR policy is adopted. Under such policy, the production of the interrupted lot will be immediately resumed when the machine is restored. Mathematical modeling and derivation of the production-inventory cost functions for both systems with/without breakdowns are presented. The renewal reward theorem is used to cope with the variable cycle length when integrating cost functions. The long-run average cost per unit time is obtained. Theorems on convexity and on bounds of production run time are proposed and proved. A recursive searching algorithm is developed for locating the optimal run time that minimizes the expected production-inventory costs. A numerical example with sensitivity analysis is provided to give insight into the optimal operational control of such an unreliable system.	mathematical optimization;production system (computer science);rework (electronics)	Singa Wang Chiu	2010	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2009.03.016	inventory control;planning;simulation;systems modeling;internationalization and localization;optimal control;convexity;computer science;mathematical model;production function;mathematics;scheduling;production system;autoregressive model;operations research;sensitivity analysis;regression analysis;statistics;recursion;search algorithm	AI	6.4062637295181855	-2.1422189491606862	180199

High-priority lots have shorter cycle times, tighter target due dates, and higher margins than normal lots. This article presents a dispatching rule for on-time delivery of high-priority lots with low tardiness for normal lots. The proposed dispatching rule uses the concept of reservation, which refers to the provisional allocation of capacity for high-priority lots. The reservation policy has been applied to ensure capacity for high-priority lots in real FABs. The reservations of high-priority lots may cause considerable tardiness of normal lots. To cope with the problem, the proposed dispatching rule considers tool utilization as well as the on-time delivery of high-priority lots. Also, we introduce the concept of reservation depth to control the influence level of the reservation. The proposed dispatching rule has been implemented and outperforms conventional dispatching rules and convention...	wafer (electronics)	Yong H. Chung;Jeong C. Seo;Chong Man Kim;Byung H. Kim;Sang C.

With the limitation of infrastructure, probe data from individual vehicles is an attractive alternative to inductive loop detectors as a mean to collect traffic data for traffic flow modelling. This paper investigates the optimal deployment strategy of probe vehicles. Data assimilation technique, Newtonian relaxation method, is used to incorporate probe data into macroscopic traffic flow model, and synthetic traffic is used to study the optimization problem. The tradeoff between the quality of traffic density estimation and operation cost of probing are investigating using multi-objective genetic algorithm. The results indicates that it is possible to decrease probe data for congested traffic with negligible degradation on the quality of traffic status estimation.	data assimilation;elegant degradation;genetic algorithm;kalman filter;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimization problem;relaxation (approximation);sensor;software deployment;synthetic intelligence;vii	Kang-Ching Chu;Kazuhiro Saitou	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2013.6654046	traffic generation model;control engineering;simulation;floating car data;engineering;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;traffic flow;transport engineering	Metrics	7.2287318508871605	3.368075480412335	181245

The demand distribution is presented as a piecewise cumulative load curve and each subsystem is allowed to consist of parallel redundant components of not more than three types. The system uses binary capacitated components chosen from a list of available products to provide redundancy so as to increase system performance and reliability. The components are characterized by their feeding capacity, reliability and cost. A system that consists of elements with different reliability and productivity parameters has the capacity strongly dependent upon the selection of constituent components. A binomial probability based method to compute exact system reliability index is suggested. To analyze the problem and suggest an optimal/near-optimal system structure, an ant colony optimization algorithm has been presented. The solution approach consists of a series of simple steps as used in early ant colony optimization algorithms dealing with other optimization problems and offers straightforward analysis. Four multi-state system design problems have been solved for illustration. Two problems are taken from the literature and solved to compare the algorithm with the other existing methods. The other two problems are based upon randomly generated data. The results show that the method can be appealing to many researchers with regard to the time efficiency and yet without compromising over the solution quality.	algorithm;ant colony;heuristic;mpeg transport stream;optimal design;series-parallel graph;software release life cycle;systems design	Vikas K.

The preventive replacement using new items are performed at T, 2T,… regardless of the age and the states of the operating items. At failure, the failed item is replaced by a used one whose age is x. Two analytical models are proposed to determine the optimal couple (T*, x*), which minimizes the total expected cost per unit of time over an infinite span or maximizes the steady state availability of the item. The residual lifetime must be greater or equal to some proportion γ of the replacement cycle of length T. Optimal strategies are derived for an item whose lifetime is distributed according to Gamma (λ, 2). The proposed replacement strategy seems quite performant and easy to implement.

Computationally, this is complex and hence, the researchers have adopted Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to transform the model into a single-level maximisation problem. However, the profit maximisation problem with KKT optimality conditions poses great challenge to the classical optimisation algorithms. The problem has become more complex after the inclusion of transmission constraints. This paper simplifies the profit maximisation problem as a minimisation function, in which the transmission constraints, the operating limits and the ISO market clearing functions are considered with no KKT optimality conditions. The derived function is solved using group search optimiser (GSO), a robust population-based optimisation algorithm.

The problem of interest is to design a control strategy off-line with no knowledge of the demand realization. Such a control strategy regulates the flow on-line as a function of the realized demand. We address both the case of systems without and with buffers. The main novelty in this work is that we consider a convex cost which is a function of the long-run average-flow and average-demand. We distinguish a worst-case scenario where the demand is the worst-one from a deterministic scenario where the demand has a neutral behavior. The resulting strategies are called min-max or deterministically optimal respectively. The main contribution are constructive methods to design either min-max or deterministically optimal strategies. We prove that while the min-max optimal strategy is memoryless, i.e., it is a piece-wise affine function of the current demand, deterministically optimal strategy must keep memory of the average flow up to the current time.

The rolling horizon planning is modeled using stochastic demands. The goal is to determine a cost allocation for this problem using the Shapley value. The game-theoretic formulation of the problem is provided and structural properties are investigated. To compute the value of the characteristic function of this game, an optimization problem formulated as a stochastic dynamic program is introduced. Due to high computational effort of stochastic dynamic programming and calculation of the Shapley value, a tailor-made solution procedure is developed. This procedure combines methods of approximate dynamic programming to find an approximate value of the characteristic function and an estimation algorithm for the Shapley value. The developed computational study tests the computational performance of the solution procedure.	travelling salesman problem	Alf Kimms;Igor Kozeletskyi	2016	EURO J.

00381185db483667c326848db70d27efca3911c0	competitive analysis of online revenue management with hierarchical resources		Abstract This paper studies an online revenue management problem of accepting and assigning two classes of customers to two levels of resources with capacity constraints. A customeru0027s request may be either accepted or rejected immediately upon its arrival without the information of further demand. One class of customers can be served either by a low-level resource at the resourceu0027s regular price, or by a high-level resource at the customeru0027s reservation price. Another class of customers can be served by either level of resource at the regular price of the corresponding resource. Given the capacities of both levels of resources, the objective is to accept appropriate customers and assign them to appropriate resources so as to maximize the total revenue. From the perspective of competitive analysis, we derive an upper bound of competitive ratio for the problem and develop an optimal online strategy whose competitive ratio matches the upper bound.

To overcome the existing block replacement policies' drawbacks, i.e., it is rather wasteful if a preventive replacement happens just after a failure replacement, in our developed policy, a replacement service for a failure is provided when there are a threshold number of failed components occurring. We also take into consideration the downtime period of each failed component using the order statistics for lifetime and age distributions for k-out-of-n systems. Several numerical examples are discussed to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology derived in this paper.	downtime;numerical analysis;numerical method	Minjae Park;Hoang Pham	2012	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans	10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2162499	maintenance engineering;order statistic;mathematics;statistics	Embedded	6.931898277584175	-1.1550312434238001	184343

A state-of-the-world decomposition approach is introduced that solves the dynamic probabilistic generation expansion problem using simple static deterministic solution techniques. The main problem is decomposed into a set of static deterministic problems. Each problem represents a distinct state-of-the-world (i.e., a time and outcome scenario) and is solved individually using a new dynamic programming procedure. The problems are linked through Lagrange multipliers that are determined iteratively and that can be interpreted as “shadow” fixed costs. Consequently, one difficult problem is replaced with many easy ones. The solution obtained represents the minimum discounted expected cost generation expansion plan. It reflects the importance of future conditions in current decisions and the utility's ability to respond to the resolution of uncertainties over time.		Adam B. Borison;Peter A. Morris;Shmuel S.

A key feature of the problem is that the demand for the vast majority of items is intermittent and lumpy, thus not allowing the use of the usual normal or Poisson distributions. The paper describes the solutions given to several practical problems in the course of developing an easy-to-use yet effective and all-encompassing inventory control system. Emphasis is placed on the accurate modeling of demand by means of a gamma distribution with a probability mass at zero or a package Poisson distribution for very-slow-moving items. Using those models and simple quantitative tools we develop an efficient procedure for approximate but quite accurate determination of the base stock levels that achieve the desired fill rates in the proposed periodic review system. We briefly describe the computerized implementation of the new system and the very encouraging results.	inventory	George Nenes;Sofia Panagiotidou;George Tagaras	2010	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2009.12.022	supply chain management;simulation;economics;marketing;operations management;mathematics;greek;operations research;statistics	Robotics	5.468531959224491	-2.3877233314877815	185439

(integrated scheduling of production and transportation operations with stage-dependent inventory costs and due dates considerations)		Increasing global competition in the business world and heightened expectations of customers have forced companies to consider not only the pricing or product quality, but reliability and timeliness of the deliveries as well. In manufacturing-centric industries such as automotive and electronics, distribution and inventory costs constitute the second and third largest cost components following the production costs. Therefore, industrial and logistics companies need to continuously search for ways to lower the inventory level and distribution cost. This trend has created a closer interaction between the different stages of a supply chain, and increased the practical usefulness of the integrated models. This thesis considers two categories of integrated scheduling problems. One is Integrated Scheduling of Production-Distribution-Inventory problems (ISPDI problems) and the other is Integrated Scheduling of Production-Inventory-Distribution-Inventory problems (ISPIDI problems). Jobs are first processed on a single machine in the production stage, and then delivered to a pre-specified customer by a capacitated transporter. Each job has a distinct due date, and must be delivered to customer before this due date. Each production batch requires a setup cost and a setup time before the first job of this batch is processed. Each round trip between the factory and customer requires a delivery cost as well as a delivery time. Moreover, it is assumed that a job which is completed before its departure date or delivered to the customer before its due date will incur a corresponding inventory cost. Our objective is to minimize the total cost involving setup, inventory and delivery costs while guaranteeing a certain customer service level. For ISPDI problems, we firstly provide a mixed integer programming model for the case of multi-product, single-stage situation, and develop an improved Genetic algorithm (GA) for solving it. Then, we extend this model to a single-product, multi-stage model, and provide two		Deyun Wang	2012				AI	9.923987709379908	2.594385206156968	186059

Four methods can be applied to solve the above model, which are chance constrained programming, robust optimization, deterministic programming, and bid-price control. In the chance constrained programming method, the stochastic constraints are converted into deterministic equivalent forms. In the robust optimization method, the model is transformed into a goal programming formulations with a scenario-based description of problem data. In the deterministic programming method, the stochastic demand variable is directly replaced with the mean value or expected value of demand. In the bid-price control, the rules for accepting cruise products are proposed. Further, to consider time-variable demand and increase the profit, a dynamic capacity allocation model for cruise two-dimensional revenue management is put forward by applying Markov Decision Process. Then the accept/reject optimal policies for a booking request of cruise products are obtained. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the capacity in the cruise line industry is two-dimensional, that is, the number of cabins and lifeboat seats can both affect availability of cruise products; (2) the demand for all kinds of cruise products is uncertain and the uncertainty can be coped with four solution methods; (3) the characteristics of the cruise industry and time-variable demand have to be incorporated into the static and dynamic capacity allocation models to maximize the expected revenue of the cruise line.	goal programming;integer programming;management system;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;robust optimization	Bingzhou Li	2010	JDCTA		yield management;revenue assurance;revenue model;computer science	DB	5.745946313710522	-0.8120508865066655	186521

Since it is in reality impractical for system operators to control large numbers of customers with deferrable demand directly, aggregators will in all likelihood be responsible for managing the individual sources of deferrable demand using instructions provided by a system operator. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of deferrable demand when 1) the aggregators act as clients to the system operator and receive physical charge/discharge instructions for managing deferrable demand (i.e. Centralized control), with 2) the aggregators follow their own interests and submit bids for purchasing energy into the wholesale auction using projected prices provided by the system operator (i.e. Hierarchical control). The analysis uses a stochastic form of multi-period Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) in a simulation using a reduction of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) network for representative days. This model treats potential wind generation and load as stochastic inputs and determines the optimum daily profiles of dispatch and demand for different realizations of hourly wind generation and load. Ramping capacity is acquired to ensure that transitions from the realizations in one hour to the next hour, as well as contingencies, can be supported. The results show that if aggregators receive stochastic forecasts of energy prices for the next 24 hours, their optimum strategy for minimizing the expected cost of their purchases from the grid is to determine a high threshold price for discharging and a low threshold price for charging, and as a result, they provide ramping services as well as benefitting from day/night price arbitrage. However, the results are sensitive to the form of the price forecasts.	centralized computing;clustered file system;discharger;dynamic dispatch;homeomorphism (graph theory);news aggregator;purchasing;simulation;smoothing;stochastic process;sysop;the daily telegraph	Hao Lu;Wooyoung Jeon;Timothy D.

To meet important operational requirements, modern high capacity conveyor systems are equipped with medium voltage variable-speed induction motor drives. The reliability and service continuity of such drives play a critical role for the entire conveyors availability. This work proposes a way to significantly improve the availability of the conveyor systems by using fault-resilient medium voltage AC drives. Based on recent studies and authors experience, it is shown in this paper how the drive conveyor downtime can be dramatically reduced after an internal short-circuit, keeping the overall cost-to-repair to a minimum and avoiding financial losses that can reach several million dollars.	belt machine;continuous operation;downtime;requirement;scott continuity	Anderson V.

The first is storage, which smooths the fluctuations of the renewable energy generation across time. The second is the concept of distributed generation combined with cooperation by exchanging energy among the distributed sources. This technique leads to energy aggregation from diverse sources, which averages out the variation in the energy production across space. The trade-off present between the two techniques is analyzed, and the optimal combination of storage and cooperation to achieve a certain grid performance is investigated. The problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the time average cost of energy exchange within the grid. First, an analytical model of the optimal cost is provided by investigating the steady state of the system for some specific scenarios. Then, an algorithm to solve the cost minimization problem using the technique of Lyapunov optimization is developed. The algorithm is implemented on the renewable energy data provided by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) of the United States. The results show that in the presence of limited storage devices, the grid can benefit greatly from cooperation, whereas in the presence of large storage, cooperation does not yield much benefit.	algorithm;load shedding;lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;randomized algorithm;stationary process;steady state;stochastic optimization	Subhash Lakshminarayana;Tony Q.

The model introduces the structure of the general marked point processes MPP. This kind of model allows us to take account of more general distributions of interarrival times than usual jump-diffusion models. In particular, stock price variations can be correlated with the times of transactions. Thus, the investors can decide to trade according to the history of market values and the sizes of price variations can also depend on the past times of transactions. By using the special decomposition of predictable processes, with respect to a marked point process, the determination of all risk-neutral probabilities is detailed. Derivative prices are calculated in this context with different basic examples.	point process	Jean-Luc Prigent	2001	Math. Oper.

Because of their deployment in critical applications, the dependability modeling and analysis of Multiple-Phased Systems is a task of primary relevance. The phased behavior makes the analysis of Multiple-Phased Systems extremely complex. This paper describes the modeling methodology and the solution procedure implemented in DEEM, a dependability modeling and evaluation tool specifically tailored for Multiple Phased Systems. It also describes its use for the solution of representative MPS problems. DEEM relies upon Deterministic and Stochastic Petri Nets as the modeling formalism, and on Markov Regenerative Processes for the model solution. When compared to existing general-purpose tools based on similar formalisms, DEEM offers advantages on both the modeling side (sub-models neatly model the phase-dependent behaviors of MPS), and on the evaluation side (a specialized algorithm allows a considerable reduction of the solution cost and time). Thus, DEEM is able to deal with all the scenarios of MPS which have been analytically treated in the literature, at a cost which is comparable with that of the cheapest ones, completely solving the issues posed by the phased-behavior of MPS."""	algorithm;dependability;general-purpose modeling;markov chain;relevance;semantics (computer science);software deployment;stochastic petri net	Andrea Bondavalli;Silvano Chiaradonna;Felicita Di Giandomenico;Ivan Mura	2004	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2004.837709	maintenance engineering;reliability engineering;verification;stochastic petri net;reliability theory;systems engineering;engineering;reliability;dependability;mathematics;markov process;petri net;educational assessment;statistics	Embedded	7.207408619045735	0.7351691953688098	190659

The studied context is a supply chain dedicated to the mass production of highly diversified products, which is common in the automotive industry. The Material Requirement Planning (MRP) approach is adapted for the monitoring of this chain; however, the distance between the production units leads to mix between production to stock and production to order for the component of interest. To prevent stock-out propagation along the downstream part of the supply chain, use of an emergency supply is triggered prior to its occurrence. The definition of the optimal safety stock and the associated optimal stock-out risk, are based on a monoperiod model that considers the cost of a safety stock and the costs incurred by the emergency supply (transportation and production). The analytical solutions that are dependent on these costs are illustrated in this study.	approximation;continuation;downstream (software development);media redundancy protocol;numerical analysis;policy-based design;procurement;safety stock;software propagation	Vincent Giard;Mustapha Sali	2013		10.3182/20130619-3-RU-3018.00187	supply chain risk management;marketing;operations management;business;commerce	NLP	9.525309670392899	-2.7162643385487573	192854

When insufficient samples are available to estimate distribution functions of the lifetimes and the repair times, it is rational to invite some experts to evaluate the belief degrees. Uncertainty theory is a branch of mathematics for modelling belief degrees. In this paper, the lifetimes and the repair times of typical repairable systems are assumed to be uncertain variables. Based on the above-mentioned assumptions, the uncertain reliability mathematical models of simple repairable series systems, simple repairable parallel systems, simple repairable series-parallel systems, and simple repairable parallel–series systems are established, respectively. The reliability indices, such as steady state availability, steady state failure frequency, mean up time, and mean down time, are proposed. Finally, some numerical examples are given for illustration.

The problem of scheduling the PEV battery charging is modeled as a Markov decision process with unknown transition probabilities. A fitted Qiteration batch reinforcement learning algorithm with kernel-based approximation of the value iteration is proposed for learning the transition dynamics and solving the charging problem. The solution is obtained based on the knowledge of the true day-ahead electricity prices and predicted prices for the second day ahead. Simulation results using true pricing data demonstrate cost savings of 8%-40% for the consumer.	algorithm;approximation;battery charger;iteration;markov chain;markov decision process;plug-in (computing);reinforcement learning;scheduling (computing);simulation	Adriana Chis;Jarmo Lundén;Visa Koivunen	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178338	pricing;mathematical optimization;kernel;simulation;computer science;mathematics;approximation algorithm	Robotics	4.483002773844889	3.011087246807702	196080
cd658e1db6f6e0abc969270c72577832c36bd2c7	product driven systems facing unexpected perturbations: how operational research models and approaches can be useful?		Production planning and control and more generally taking a decision in the context of production systems often consider that input information are known, static and predictable. However, uncertainties on data and perturbations are recorded in the genetic of every production system. For instance, it is impossible to know exactly the level of the demand for a product, the availability of resources, etc. Dealing with this issue raises the question of the ability to take robust decisions against uncertainty (off-line) or the ability to be flexible (on-line). This paper proposes to analyse how Product Driven Systems—as reactive systems against unpredicted perturbations—can be part of operational research solution process against perturbations. Moreover, an overview of models and approaches for dealing with uncertainty in Operational Research is given and a first proposition is made to apply these elements into PDS as decision-making-against-perturbations engines.	operations research	Alexis Aubry;Hind Bril;André Thomas;Mireille Jacomino	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-51100-9_23	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;operations management	Robotics	9.885180542776762	2.492710049732345	196650

Finally we present a method to determine the fill rate.	markov chain;stationary process;stochastic matrix	Thomas DuBois;Georges Allaert;Frank Witlox	2013	Oper. Res.

We introduce a new design of bucket brigades to reduce unproductive travel. Under the new design, each worker works on one side of an aisle when he proceeds in one direction and works on the other side when he proceeds in the reverse direction. We propose simple rules for workers to share work under the new design and find a sufficient condition for the system to self-balance. Numerical examples suggest that the improvement in throughput by the new design can be as large as 30%. Even with a 20% reduction in labor, the new design can still increase throughput by 7%.	bucket sort;bucket-brigade device;production system (computer science);throughput	Yun Fong Lim	2011	Operations Research	10.1287/opre.1110.0958	dynamical systems theory;simulation;operations management;operations research	HCI	4.827065664730511	0.5361262886372385	197263

Developing an FCV with high reliability is an important goal for automobile factories and research institutions. Other key factors required by FCVs include mass production and customer approval. An FCV is a complex mechanism composed of many subsystems. During the development of the overall vehicle, steps should be taken to ensure that every subsystem is reliable. However, such development must also consider costs, which must be kept as low as possible. To ensure the reliability of FCV while operating under conditions that demand minimal cost, a genetic algorithm is employed to reallocate the reliability of the overall vehicle system. First, the growth factor of the reliability–feasibility of each subsystem is determined according to the complexity, importance, and technological level of the FCV subsystems. The FCV cost model is then established on the basis of such parameters as subsystem cost, reliability–feasibility growth factor, initial reliability, limit reliability, and so on. A genetic algorithm is then used to compute for the reliability of FCV subsystems. The rationality of reliability reallocation is verified according to the subsystem importance coefficient. This method considers the benefits for both enterprises and customers by applying principles of engineering and conducting a reliability study.

For the first class of customers, the company then (1) has an option to accept or reject him/her (admission control), or (2) decides on an offering price (pricing control). The second-class (sideline) customers are only served if no first-class customers are in the system, and this yields the sideline profit. In this paper, we discuss both admission control and pricing control problems within an identical framework, and we examine the properties of the optimal policies to maximize the total expected present discounted net profits. We show that when the sideline profit is large, the optimal policies may not be monotone in the number of first-class customers in the system.

The warranty period offered by the manufacturer/dealer has been progressively increasing since the beginning of the 20th Century. Currently, a large number of products are being sold with long-term warranty policies in the form of extended warranty, warranty for used products, service contracts and lifetime warranty policies. Lifetime warranties are relatively a new concept. The modelling of failures during the warranty period and the costs for such policies are complex since the lifespan in these policies are not defined well and it is often difficult to tell about life measures for the longer period of coverage due to usage pattern/maintenance activities undertaken and uncertainties of costs over the period. This paper focuses on defining lifetime, developing lifetime warranty policies and models for predicting failures and estimating costs for lifetime warranty policies.

This paper discusses an inspection model that is established under an assumption that the plant item's state can be classified into four states corresponding to a three-stage failure process. The failed state is always observed immediately, but the other three states, namely normal, minor defective and severe defective, can only be identified by an inspection. The durations of the normal, minor defective and severe defective states constitute a three-stage failure process. This assumption is actually motivated by real world observations where the plant state is often classified by a three colour scheme, e.g., green, yellow and red corresponding to the three states before failure. The three-stage failure concept proposed is an extension to the delay time concept where the plant failure process is divided into a two-stage process. However such extension provides more modelling options than the two-stage model and is a step closer to reality since a binary description of the plat item's state is restrictive. By formulating the probabilities of defective state identification and failure, we are able to establish a model to optimise the inspection interval with respect to a criterion function of interest. A real world example is presented to show the applicability of the model.		Wenbin Wang	2011	Rel. Eng. & Sys.
