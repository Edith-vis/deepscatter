Accordingly, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is nowadays considered a relevant learning criterion, accommodating imbalanced data, misclassification costs and noisy data. We show how a genetic algorithm-based optimization of the AUC criterion can be exploited for impact studies and sensitivity analysis. The approach is illustrated on the Atherosclerosis Identification problem, PKDD 2002 Challenge.	data mining	Michèle Sebag;Jérôme Azé;Noël Lucas	2003		10.1109/ICDM.2003.1250996	unsupervised learning;genetic algorithm;computer science;online machine learning;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;generalization error	ML	9.349252611627838	-39.87077031340515	199793

We first construct privacy-preserving ID3 decision trees using differentially private sum queries. Our experiments show that for many data sets a reasonable privacy guarantee can only be obtained via this method at a steep cost of accuracy in predictions. We then present a differentially private decision tree ensemble algorithm using the random decision tree approach. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach yields good prediction accuracy even when the size of the datasets is small. We also present a differentially private algorithm for the situation in which new data is periodically appended to an existing database. Our experiments show that our differentially private random decision tree classifier handles data updates in a way that maintains the same level of privacy guarantee.	algorithm;decision tree;differential privacy;experiment	Geetha Jagannathan;Krishnan Pillaipakkamnatt;Rebecca N.
