4c3f121c9025cb3ceedb18b89ddfa0deb150bf76	the evolution of paired fins	vertebrate appendage phylogeny development archipterygium	The Archipterygium is Gegenbaur’s most lasting contribution to the study of vertebrate limb evolution. This transformational hypothesis of gill arches to limb girdles, rays to fins, and proposal of a vertebrate fin-limb groundplan, is generally treated as a flawed alternative to the more widely accepted lateral fin-fold hypothesis of vertebrate limb evolution. When compared to the phylogenetic distribution and diversity of fins and limbs, both hypotheses fail. Dermal skeletal lateral folds, spines and keels originate repeatedly in vertebrate evolution, but paired fins with girdles originate at pectoral level and are anteroposteriorly restricted. Pelvic fins emerge later in phylogeny; pectoral and pelvic appendages primitively differ. Endoskeletal girdles never exhibit characteristics of gill arches. The emergent sequence of paired fin evolution depends upon phylogenetic hypotheses within which extant agnathan interrelationships are uncertain; positions of jawless fossil fish along the gnathostome stem are insecure; the fossil data set is patchy. However, certain features of the data set are robust. This has prompted a reconsideration of Gegenbaur’s hypothesized arch-girdle relationship, and an iterative homology between scapulocoracoid and extrabranchial cartilages is suggested. No transformation of arch to girdle is necessarily implied, but some signal of developmental relatedness is predicted.	cladistics;emergence;evolution;fossil;homology (biology);iterative method;lateral thinking;phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;robustness (computer science)	Michael I.

90d446e3cc3f0a23d9318c260f0480f985c68aa0	identification of novel inhibitor against endonuclease subunit of influenza ph1n1 polymerase: a combined molecular docking, molecular dynamics, mmpbsa, qmmm and adme studies to combat influenza a viruses	adme prediction;endonuclease;influenza h1n1;molecular docking;molecular dynamics	The influenza H1N1 virus is the causative agent of the flu pandemic in the world. Due to the shortage of effective means of control, it is remained the serious threats to public and avian health. To battle the surge of viral outbreaks, new treatments are crucially needed. The viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for transcription and replication of the RNA genome, is comprised of subunits PA, PB1 and PB2. PA has endonuclease activity and is a well known target for inhibitor and drug design. In the current study, we employed molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD), MMPBSA, QMMM and ADME studies to find and propose an inhibitor among 11,873 structures against PA. Our molecular docking, MD, MMPBSA and QMMM studies showed that ZINC15340668 has ideal characteristics as a potent PA inhibitor, and can be used in experimental phase and further development. Also, ADME prediction demonstrated that all physico-chemical parameters are within the acceptable range defined for human use. Molecular mechanism based study revealed that upon inhibitor binding; the flexibility of PA backbone is increased. This observation demonstrates the plasticity of PA active site, and it should be noticed in drug design against PA Influenza A viruses. In the final phase of the study, the efficiency of our proposed hit was tested computationally against mutant drug resistant I38T_PA. Our results exhibited that the hit inhibits the I38T_PA in different manner with high potency.	adme study;aves;boat dock;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;drug design;influenza a virus;internet backbone;molecular dynamics;murine sarcoma viruses;pa-risc;pancrelipase;qm/mm;rna;thrombocytopenia;transcription (software);vertebral column;virus diseases;endonuclease	Seyed Sajad Mohseni;Fariborz Nasri;Kambiz Davari;Sako Mirzaie;Atousa Moradzadegan;Fatemeh Abdi;Farhad Farzaneh	2018	Computational biology and chemistry	10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2018.08.005		Comp.	8.361916999575921	-61.56581030164547	118411
4cae9b655bb847049d4a592c6da3c676be2cda5e	an explanation of biphasic characters of mrna translocation in the ribosome	protein synthesis;translation;translocation;ribosome;hybrid state	Translocation is an essential step in the elongation cycle of protein synthesis in which mRNA that is coupled with tRNAs by codon-anticodon interaction is moved through the ribosome. It has been well documented that the kinetics of mRNA translocation generally shows biphasic character. However, the physical basis of the phenomenon is unclear. Here, to explain the phenomenon we consider two models. In one model (Model I), besides the classical non-rotated and rotated conformations of the ribosome there also exists an intermediate conformation between the two classical conformations. The mRNA translocation occurs via proceeding from the rotated (hybrid) pretranslocation to intermediate to non-rotated posttranslocation state. In another model (Model II), only the classical non-rotated and rotated conformations are considered. Before EF-G binding, the ribosomal complex is in either the classical non-rotated or rotated (hybrid) pretranslocation state, with the equilibrium with each other. EF-G can bind to both states and then the mRNA translocation occurs via proceeding either directly from the hybrid to non-rotated posttranslocation state or from the non-rotated pretranslocation to hybrid to non-rotated posttranslocation state. Analytical studies showed that Model I is unable to explain the biphasic character of mRNA translocation. By contrast, Model II can not only provide a good explanation of the biphasic character of mRNA translocation but also explain the kinetics of the reverse ribosomal rotation from the rotated to non-rotated conformation, which can be fit to a single exponential. Thus, Model II could be the appropriate one for the kinetic pathway of mRNA translocation.	anticodon;codon (nucleotide sequence);document completion status - documented;entity framework;gene regulatory network;kinetics internet protocol;personality character;protein biosynthesis;ribosomes;exponential	Zhanfeng Wang	2014	Bio Systems	10.1016/j.biosystems.2014.01.009	translation;biology;molecular biology;chromosomal translocation;ribosome;genetics;protein biosynthesis	ECom	7.60605653498126	-64.47554739281829	118621
bac3fc50400415868fe3d46f94197f2445b330d5	genome-wide identification and evolutionary analysis of b7-h3	exon duplication;gene structure;phylogenetic analysis	B7-H3 is an immune co-stimulatory molecule of the B7 family that contains a set of immunoglobulin-V (IgV) and immunoglobulin-C (IgC) domains. To explore the evolutionary process of B7-H3 gene, we conducted a genome-wide structure and phylogenetic analysis of B7-H3 genes in currently sequenced genomes. On the basis of the available data, 17 mammalian B7-H3 genes were predicted to have tandemly duplicated 4Ig domains. The analysis of gene structure and phylogenesis reveal that these 4IgB7-H3 genes resulted from domain duplication. Nevertheless, no difference in function has been observed between the two isoforms. It is more likely that domain duplication in 4IgB7-H3 leads to functional redundancy.

The model is based on Hill regulation functions and uses ordinary differential equations. The network response to a trigger of D-xylose is considered and stability analysis is performed. The activating, repressive feedback, and the combined effect of the two feedbacks on the network behavior are analyzed. Simulation and systems analysis showed significant influence of activating and repressing feedback on metabolite expression profiles. The dynamics of the D-xylose input function has an important effect on the profiles of the individual metabolite concentrations. Variation of the time delay in the feedback loop has no significant effect on the pattern of the response. The stability and existence of oscillatory behavior depends on which proteins are involved in the feedback loop. The dynamics in the regulation properties of the network are dictated mainly by the transcription and translation degradation rate parameters, and by the D-xylose consumption profile. This holds true with and without feedback in the network. Feedback was found to significantly influence the expression dynamics of genes and proteins. Feedback increases the metabolite abundance, changes the steady state values, alters the time trajectories and affects the response oscillatory behavior and stability conditions. The modeling approach provides insight into network behavioral dynamics particularly for small-sized networks. The analysis of the network dynamics has provided useful information for experimental design for future in vitro experimental work.	aspergillus;broadcast delay;design of experiments;elegant degradation;feedback;in vitro [publication type];machine translation;regulon;simulation;steady state;transcription (software);xylose	Jimmy Omony;Leo H. de Graaff;Gerrit van Straten;Anton J.

Identifying which host proteins and complexes come into physical contact with the viral proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how HIV rewires the host’s cellular machinery during the course of infection. Here we report the use of affinity tagging and purification mass spectrometry to determine systematically the physical interactions of all 18 HIV-1 proteins and polyproteins with host proteins in two different human cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat). Using a quantitative scoring system that we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497 HIV–human protein–protein interactions involving 435 individual human proteins, with ∼40% of the interactions being identified in both cell types. We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. This host protein is one of eleven identified in this analysis that act to inhibit HIV replication. This data set facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery is manipulated during the course of HIV infection.	conserved sequence;cultured cell line;endopeptidases;fundamental interaction;hiv infections;hiv protease;immunologic deficiency syndromes;peptide initiation factors;polyproteins;primates;processor affinity;prokaryotic initiation factor-3;purification of quantum state;self-replicating machine;transcription initiation;translation initiation;viral proteins;cell type	Stefanie Jäger;Peter Cimermancic;Natali Gulbahce;Jeffrey R.

Phylogenetic studies have been performed to investigate the relationships of the V. cholerae populations in worldwide. In this study, phylogenetic relationship between V. cholerae isolates from Iran and other regions of the world was determined, based on three housekeeping genes analysis. Results for Iranian strains showed that congruency of asd and hlyA phylogenetic trees were remarkably higher than recA tree. Iranian strains displayed 2-3%, 1-14% and 3-5% deference in asd, hlyA and recA nucleotide sequences, respectively. Sequence similarity degrees were variable between Iranian and other region's strains. Furthermore, the non-congruence in the phylogeny of the pathogenic clones in cladograms is probably due to horizontal gene transfer. Finally, results of this study suggest that monitoring of surface waters for housekeeping genes of V. cholerae in the cholera endemic areas may be valuable for forecasting the expected cholera outbreaks.	categorization;cholera vaccine;cladogram;congruence of squares;gene transfer, horizontal;genes, housekeeping;iranian.com;nucleotides;phase ii/iii trial;phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;pierre robin syndrome;population;projections and predictions;science;trees (plant);vibrio cholerae ab:acnc:pt:ser:qn;vibrio cholerae toxin ag:prthr:pt:isolate:ord;water;gram	Tayebeh Farhadi;Navid Nezafat;Younes Ghasemi	2015	International journal of computational biology and drug design	10.1504/IJCBDD.2015.068789	biology;forecasting;bioinformatics;housekeeping gene;horizontal gene transfer;microbiology;genetics;phylogenetics	Comp.	3.752939529458958	-64.62266543785947	120624

This discrete behavior causes significant quantities of intrinsic noise. In some cases, mechanisms exist in the system to repress this noise. With different parameters, the same mechanisms may amplify the noise. By examining the properties of how noise is transmitted through the system, one can gather significant information about the system and aid researchers to identify system properties. In this paper, we consider a few simple analytical schemes to identify the parameters of gene transcription and translation processes with feedback regulation. While protein distributions can be measured with fluorescent protein tagging and flow cytometry, it is much more difficult to measure the quantities of messenger RNAs in a single cell. We show that with the right experimental procedures involving measurements of proteins alone, one can identify transcription and translation parameters.	experiment;gene regulatory network;image noise;initial condition;systems biology;transcription (software);transient noise;triplet state	Brian Munsky;Mustafa Khammash	2008	2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2008.4739095	stochastic process;rna;bioinformatics;mathematics	Comp.	7.208436133227821	-65.48616242375185	120671

Functional loss of two isoforms (CK1-α/ε) has been shown to activate the carcinogenic pathway which involves the stabilization of of cytoplasmic β-catenin. Development of anticancer therapeutics is very laborious task and depends upon the structural and conformational details of the target. This study focuses on, how the structural dynamics and conformational changes of two CK1 isoforms are synchronized in carcinogenic pathway. The conformational dynamics in kinases is the responsible for their action as has been supported by the molecular docking experiments.		Surya Pratap Singh;Dwijendra K.

As the most plausible mechanism, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids in the prebiotic sea caused spontaneous and effective optical resolution through self crystallization, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid has never occurred without the aid of an optically active molecule. This hypothesis is based on recrystallization of a mixture of D,L-amino acids in the presence of excess of D,L-asparagine (Asn). The enantiomeric excess (ee) of each amino acid in the resulting crystals indicates that crystallization of co-existing amino acids with the configuration same as that of Asn took place, although it was incidental whether the enrichment occurred in Lor D-amino acids. In addition, the resulting ee was sufficiently high (up to 100%) to account for the predominance of L-amino acids on the earth.	biosphere;gene ontology term enrichment;offset binary;optical rotation;spontaneous order	Shosuke Kojo	2010	Symmetry	10.3390/sym2021022	amino acid;enantioselective synthesis;homochirality;crystallization;enantiomeric excess;optical resolution;physics	Theory	5.609174763842182	-64.00538484695257	121032

There is evidence tha t, on one hand, classical alignment procedures only roughly reflect the evoluti nary processes and, on the other hand, that they cause structural changes in the p roteins’ surfaces. We first demonstrate how to identify alignment gaps that have been introduced by evolution to a statistical significant degree, by means of a n ovel, sound statistical framework, based on pair hidden Markov models (HMMs). Secon d, we examine paralogous protein pairs in E. coli, obtained by computatio n of classical global alignments. Distinguishing between indel and non-indel pa irs, ccording to our novel statistics, revealed that, despite having the same se quence identity, indel pairs are significantly less functionally similar than nonindel pairs, as measured by recently suggested GO based functional distances. This s ugge ts that indels cause more severe functional changes than other types of seq uence variation and that indel statistics should be taken into additional accou nt to assess functional similarity between paralogous protein pairs.	hidden markov model;homology (biology);markov chain;sequence homology	Raheleh Salari;Alexander Schönhuth;Fereydoun Hormozdiari;Artem Cherkasov;Süleyman Cenk Sahinalp	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87361-7_28	biology;functional divergence;computer science;bioinformatics;structural change;mathematics;statistical significance;markov model;genetics;hidden markov model;statistics	Comp.	3.536982320225175	-61.33850962383537	121592
f3b5defaa458e58cf49681b5552c3fb16ca70174	a kinetic mechanism for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors based on multiple allosteric transitions	transition state;monod wyman changeux;resting state;kinetic model;functional properties;serveur institutionnel;nicotinic acetylcholine receptor;single channel;archive institutionnelle;open access;trans membrane;archive ouverte unige;dose response;cybertheses;kinetics;institutional repository	 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are transmembrane oligomeric proteins that mediate interconversions between open and closed channel states under the control of neurotransmitters. Fast in vitro chemical kinetics and in vivo electrophysiological recordings are consistent with the following multi-step scheme. Upon binding of agonists, receptor molecules in the closed but activatable resting state (the Basal state, B) undergo rapid transitions to states of higher affinities with either open channels (the Active state, A) or closed channels (the initial Inactivatable and fully Desensitized states, I and D). In order to represent the functional properties of such receptors, we have developed a kinetic model that links conformational interconversion rates to agonist binding and extends the general principles of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric transitions. The crucial assumption is that the linkage is controlled by the position of the interconversion transition states on a hypothetical linear reaction coordinate. Application of the model to the peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) accounts for the main properties of ligand-gating, including single-channel events, and several new relationships are predicted. Kinetic simulations reveal errors inherent in using the dose-response analysis, but justify its application under defined conditions. The model predicts that (in order to overcome the intrinsic stability of the B state and to produce the appropriate cooperativity) channel activation is driven by an A state with a Kd in the 50 nM range, hence some 140-fold stronger than the apparent affinity of the open state deduced previously. According to the model, recovery from the desensitized states may occur via rapid transit through the A state with minimal channel opening, thus without necessarily undergoing a distinct recovery pathway, as assumed in the standard ‘cyclic’ model. Transitions to the desensitized states by low concentration ‘pre-pulses’ are predicted to occur without significant channel opening, but equilibrium values of IC50 can be obtained only with long pre-pulse times. Predictions are also made concerning allosteric effectors and their possible role in coincidence detection. In terms of future developments, the analysis presented here provides a physical basis for constructing more biologically realistic models of synaptic modulation that may be applied to artificial neural networks.	acetylcholine;artificial neural network;assumed;basal (phylogenetics);chemical kinetics (discipline);cholinergic receptors;gene regulatory network;gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor;inhibitory concentration 50;kinetics internet protocol;ligands;linkage (software);modulation;nicotinic receptors;numerous;peripheral;processor affinity;reaction coordinate;rest;resting state fmri;synaptic package manager;video-in video-out;genetic linkage	Stuart J.

To decipher the mechanism underlying the formation of tau aggregates, we developed a novel approach for constructing models of natively unfolded proteins. The method, energy-minima mapping and weighting (EMW), samples local energy minima of subsequences within a natively unfolded protein and then constructs ensembles from these energetically favorable conformations that are consistent with a given set of experimental data. A unique feature of the method is that it does not strive to generate a single ensemble that represents the unfolded state. Instead we construct a number of candidate ensembles, each of which agrees with a given set of experimental constraints, and focus our analysis on local structural features that are present in all of the independently generated ensembles. Using EMW we generated ensembles that are consistent with chemical shift measurements obtained on tau constructs. Thirty models were constructed for the second microtubule binding repeat (MTBR2) in wild-type (WT) tau and a DeltaK280 mutant, which is found in some forms of frontotemporal dementia. By focusing on structural features that are preserved across all ensembles, we find that the aggregation-initiating sequence, PHF6*, prefers an extended conformation in both the WT and DeltaK280 sequences. In addition, we find that residue K280 can adopt a loop/turn conformation in WT MTBR2 and that deletion of this residue, which can adopt nonextended states, leads to an increase in locally extended conformations near the C-terminus of PHF6*. As an increased preference for extended states near the C-terminus of PHF6* may facilitate the propagation of beta-structure downstream from PHF6*, these results explain how a deletion at position 280 can promote the formation of tau aggregates.	alzheimer's disease;biologic preservation;brain;decipher prostate cancer test;deletion mutation;dementia;downstream (software development);electrokinetically modified water;intrinsically disordered proteins;maxima and minima;microtubules;phf6 gene;patients;software propagation;tau-leaping	Austin Huang;Collin M.

b6263aaaee7b921570adb40d7ebcba9068ac3dd8	identification of antipsychotic drug fluspirilene as a potential p53-mdm2 inhibitor: a combined computational and experimental study	p53-mdm2;docking;prime/mm-gbsa;molecular dynamics;colon cancer	The inhibition of tumor suppressor p53 protein due to its direct interaction with oncogenic murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein, plays a central role in almost 50 % of all human tumor cells. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of the p53-binding pocket on MDM2, leading to p53 activation, presents an important therapeutic target against these cancers expressing wild-type p53. In this context, the present study utilized an integrated virtual and experimental screening approach to screen a database of approved drugs for potential p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors. Specifically, using an ensemble rigid-receptor docking approach with four MDM2 protein crystal structures, six drug molecules were identified as possible p53-MDM2 inhibitors. These drug molecules were then subjected to further molecular modeling investigation through flexible-receptor docking followed by Prime/MM-GBSA binding energy analysis. These studies identified fluspirilene, an approved antipsychotic drug, as a top hit with MDM2 binding mode and energy similar to that of a native MDM2 crystal ligand. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested stable binding of fluspirilene to the p53-binding pocket on MDM2 protein. The experimental testing of fluspirilene showed significant growth inhibition of human colon tumor cells in a p53-dependent manner. Fluspirilene also inhibited growth of several other human tumor cell lines in the NCI60 cell line panel. Taken together, these computational and experimental data suggest a potentially novel role of fluspirilene in inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction. It is noteworthy here that fluspirilene has a long history of safe human use, thus presenting immediate clinical potential as a cancer therapeutic. Furthermore, fluspirilene could also serve as a structurally-novel lead molecule for the development of more potent, small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitors against several types of cancer. Importantly, the combined computational and experimental screening protocol presented in this study may also prove useful for screening other commercially-available compound databases for identification of novel, small molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitors.

df30fea1d9f4c107b4c41337bd1283c5ad7c5704	mining of randomly generated molecular fragment populations uncovers activity-specific fragment hierarchies		We introduce a methodology to analyze random molecular fragment populations and determine conditional probability relationships between fragments. Random fragment profiles are generated for an arbitrary set of molecules, and each observed fragment is assigned a frequency vector. An algorithm is designed to compare frequency vectors and derive dependencies of fragment occurrence. Using calculated dependency values, random fragment populations can be organized in graphs that capture their relationships and make it possible to map fragment pathways of biologically active molecules. For sets of molecules having similar activity, unique fragment signatures are identified. The analysis reveals that random fragment profiles contain compound class-specific information and provides evidence for the existence of activity-specific fragment hierarchies.	algorithm;fragment identifier;personnameuse - assigned;population;type signature	José Batista;Jürgen Bajorath	2007	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci700108q	bioinformatics;hierarchy;conditional probability;graph;computer science	ML	3.9073276310133047	-60.35761307230222	123826

The combinatorial theory of RNA structures and the dynamic programming algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction are extended here to incorporate G-quadruplexes using a simple but plausible energy model. With preliminary energy parameters we find that the overwhelming majority of putative quadruplex-forming sequences in the human genome are likely to fold into canonical secondary structures instead.	algorithm;dynamic programming;protein structure prediction	Ronny Lorenz;Stephan H.

Selection used to be considered as the only directional process among the evolutionary mechanisms. In fact the mutational pressure is also “directional” which means that the rates of particular nucleotide substitutions tend to produce a DNA molecule with a specific nucleotide composition. Using Monte Carlo simulations we have shown that the genetic code plays the central role in buffering the effect of mutations and that all three elements are optimised in the generation of the genetic diversity in such a way that deleterious effects of mutations are substantially reduced. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

b195477b0b5a5a8aaf99aff6ab3b8e4aa063e7b9	cash: a constructing comprehensive splice site method for detecting alternative splicing events		RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) can generate millions of reads to provide clues for analyzing novel or abnormal alternative splicing (AS) events in cells. However, current methods for exploring AS events are still far from being satisfactory. Here, we present Comprehensive AS Hunting (CASH), which constructs comprehensive splice sites including known and novel AS sites in cells, and identifies differentially AS events between cells. We illuminated the versatility of CASH on RNA-seq data from a wide range of species and also on simulated in silico data, validated the advantages of CASH over other AS predictors and exhibited novel differentially AS events. Moreover, we used CASH to identify SRSF10-regulated AS events and investigated the evolution of SRSF10-regulated splicing. The results showed that SRSF10-regulated splicing events are highly evolvable from chickens, mice to humans. However, SRSF10-regulated splicing model was observed to be immutable, in which SRSF10 binding to cassette exon promotes exon inclusion while binding to downstream exon induces exon skipping. Altogether, CASH can significantly improve the detection of AS events and facilitate the study of AS regulation and function in cells; the SRSF10 data first demonstrate a flexibility of SRSF10 with their regulated splicing events but an immutability of SRSF10-regulated splicing model to produce opposite AS outcomes in vertebrates.	alternative splicing;base sequence;biological evolution;biopolymer sequencing;compact cassette;downstream (software development);event-driven soa;exons;immutable object;rna splicing;srsf10 gene;sensor;sequence number;splice (system call)	Wenwu Wu;Jie Zong;Ning Wei;Jian Cheng;Xuexia Zhou;Yuanming Cheng;Dai Chen;Qinghua Guo;Bo Zhang;Ying Feng	2018	Briefings in bioinformatics	10.1093/bib/bbx034	bioinformatics;world wide web;genetics	Comp.	5.796452039525066	-62.15499783050411	124372

Even the smallest disturbances in the orchestration of circadian gene expression patterns among different tissues can result in functional asynchrony, at the organism level, and may to contribute to a wide range of physiologic disorders. It has been reported that as many as 5%-10% of transcribed genes in peripheral tissues follow a circadian expression pattern. We have conducted a comprehensive study of circadian gene expression on a large dataset representing three different peripheral tissues. The data have been produced in a large-scale microarray experiment covering replicate daily cycles in murine white and brown adipose tissues as well as in liver. We have applied three alternative algorithmic approaches to identify circadian oscillation in time series expression profiles. Analyses of our own data indicate that the expression of at least 7% to 21% of active genes in mouse liver, and in white and brown adipose tissues follow a daily oscillatory pattern. Indeed, analysis of data from other laboratories suggests that the percentage of genes with an oscillatory pattern may approach 50% in the liver. For the rest of the genes, oscillation appears to be obscured by stochastic noise. Our phase classification and computer simulation studies based on multiple datasets indicate no detectable boundary between oscillating and non-oscillating fractions of genes. We conclude that greater attention should be given to the potential influence of circadian mechanisms on any biological pathway related to metabolism and obesity.	adipose tissue;asynchrony (computer programming);body tissue;computer simulation;gene expression;gene regulatory network;laboratory;microarray;obesity;peripheral;self-replicating machine;silo (dataset);sleep disorders, circadian rhythm;time series;nervous system disorder	Andrey A.

In the reported investigation, genome analysis of a major opportunistic fungus Rhizopus oryzae was undertaken to identify gene or protein sequences that may serve as targets for therapeutic interventions. Using database of essential genes six proteins were identified. These proteins are implicated in metabolic/cellular pathways, which are more likely to be crucial for target organism's viability.

The scientific community faces an ongoing challenge in the analysis of these rich data sources to more accurately characterize biological processes that have been perturbed at the mechanistic level. Here, a new approach is built on previous methodologies in which high-throughput data was interpreted using prior biological knowledge of cause and effect relationships. These relationships are structured into network models that describe specific biological processes, such as inflammatory signaling or cell cycle progression. This enables quantitative assessment of network perturbation in response to a given stimulus. Four complementary methods were devised to quantify treatment-induced activity changes in processes described by network models. In addition, companion statistics were developed to qualify significance and specificity of the results. This approach is called Network Perturbation Amplitude (NPA) scoring because the amplitudes of treatment-induced perturbations are computed for biological network models. The NPA methods were tested on two transcriptomic data sets: normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells treated with the pro-inflammatory signaling mediator TNFα, and HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with the CDK cell cycle inhibitor R547. Each data set was scored against network models representing different aspects of inflammatory signaling and cell cycle progression, and these scores were compared with independent measures of pathway activity in NHBE cells to verify the approach. The NPA scoring method successfully quantified the amplitude of TNFα-induced perturbation for each network model when compared against NF-κB nuclear localization and cell number. In addition, the degree and specificity to which CDK-inhibition affected cell cycle and inflammatory signaling were meaningfully determined. The NPA scoring method leverages high-throughput measurements and a priori literature-derived knowledge in the form of network models to characterize the activity change for a broad collection of biological processes at high-resolution. Applications of this framework include comparative assessment of the biological impact caused by environmental factors, toxic substances, or drug treatments.	biological factors;biological processes;biological network;cdk inhibitor r547;causal filter;causality;cell cycle progression;cellular phone;colon carcinoma;colon classification;colonic neoplasms;color gradient;face;gene regulatory network;high-throughput computing;image resolution;mediator brand of benfluorex hydrochloride;network model;neural oscillation;poisons;printer working group;score;sensitivity and specificity;throughput;cancer cell;substance	Florian Martin;Ty M.

Unlike the corresponding diesters of thymidine, these two compounds are diastereoisomers. Their affinity for phosphodiesterases types I and II were investigated. Both analogues were hydrolysed very slowly by snake venom phosphodiesterase but their affinity for the enzyme was similar to that of the p-nitrophenyl ester of thymidine 5'-monophosphate of which they were both competitive inhibitors with Ki approximately Km. Neither compound was hydrolysed by spleen phosphodiesterase but both competitively inhibited the p-nitrophenyl ester of thymidine 3'-monophosphate, with Ki's slightly higher than the Km. Although for each enzyme the Ki of the correct analogue phosphodiester (i.e. the 5'-derivative for snake venom and the 3'-derivative for spleen) was the lower, the absolute specificity seen for the normal substrates had been lost.	4-nitrophenylphosphatase;analog;binary prefix;esters;ng-nitroarginine methyl ester;nucleoside analogs;nucleosides;potassium iodide;processor affinity;sensitivity and specificity;snake venoms;spleen tissue;thymidine;toxicofera;phosphodiester;phosphoric diester hydrolase	A.

Since the mutational pressure is asymmetric – different for each of the two DNA strands, and the coding sequences are also asymmetric, the mutagenic effect depends on the topology of the coding sequence on the chromosome. While the direct effect of the directional mutational pressure on the codon usage is predictable, the effect on the amino-acid composition depends on the degeneracy of the genetic code, initial composition of the protein sequence and codon usage. Assuming additional degeneracy of information connected with the structure of amino-acids, we have found that the best strategy for the evolution of some genes in the B. burgdorferi genome is to change the mutational pressure by inversions, which corresponds to changing the substitution matrix to the mirror one. It mimics the behavior of a stock market player who can gain by investing only in two stock sets even if during that time both sets have lost.	degeneracy (graph theory);experiment;monte carlo method;simulation;stochastic process;substitution matrix	Malgorzata Dudkiewicz;Pawel Mackiewicz;Aleksandra Nowicka;Maria Kowalczuk;Dorota Mackiewicz;Natalia Polak;Kamila Smolarczyk;Miroslaw R.

The extended model including a positive regulatory element, most likely auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6, reproduces the observed experimental data most convincingly. The extension is shown to be consistent with the original model and contains very sensitive processes which may serve as potential intervention targets.	broadcast delay;gene regulatory network;microgram per liter;regulatory sequences, nucleic acid;scientific publication;signal transduction pathways;traf6 gene;therapeutic radiology procedure	Johannes Witt;Sandra Barisic;Oliver Sawodny;Michael Ederer;Dagmar Kulms;Thomas Sauter	2011		10.1186/1687-4153-2011-3	biology;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;mathematical model;il1b;biological engineering;operations research;systems biology	Metrics	8.477720713562585	-65.1508566213255	126188

While examining over 800,000 DNA variants in wild isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans, we made a discovery that the proportions of variant types are not constant across the C. elegans genome. The variant proportion is defined as the fraction of a specific variant type (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or indel) within a broader set of variants (e.g. all variants or all non-SNPs). The proportions of most variant types show a correlation with the recombination rate. These correlations can be explained as a result of a concerted action of two mutation mechanisms, which we named Morgan and Sanger mechanisms. The two proposed mechanisms act according to the distinct components of the recombination rate, specifically the genetic and physical distance. Regression analysis was used to explore the characteristics and contributions of the two mutation mechanisms. According to our model, ~20-40% of all mutations in C. elegans wild populations are derived from programmed meiotic double strand breaks, which precede chromosomal crossovers and thus may be the point of origin for the Morgan mechanism. A substantial part of the known correlation between the recombination rate and variant distribution appears to be caused by the mutations generated by the Morgan mechanism. Mathematically integrating the mutation model with background selection model gives a more complete depiction of how the variant landscape is shaped in C. elegans. Similar analysis should be possible in other species by examining the correlation between the recombination rate and variant landscape within the context of our mutation model.	genetic algorithm;hereditary diseases;indel mutation;morgan;name;nitroprusside;nucleotides;population;rbfox1 gene;single nucleotide polymorphism;single-chain antibodies;strand (programming language);unc13b gene	Hoyon Hwang;Jiou Wang	2017		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005369	mutation;biology;natural selection;recombinant dna;bioinformatics;linear regression;sequence analysis;genetics;regression analysis	PL	3.8803239642329084	-61.89339199958829	126379

Bioinformatic analyses of mammalian genomes were undertaken using known human STS and ARS amino acid sequences to study the evolution of these genes and proteins encoded on eutherian and marsupial genomes. Several domain regions and key residues were conserved including signal peptides, active site residues, metal (Ca2+) and substrate binding sequences, transmembranes and N-glycosylation sites. Phylogenetic analyses describe the relationships and potential origins of these genes during mammalian evolution. Primate ARSH enzymes lacked signal peptide sequences which may influence their biological functions.

These RNAs are functional important in many biological processes. Their biological functions are highly related to their interaction partners. RNA-RNA interactions are one of the possibilities. It is desired to use computational methods to study and predict the interaction partners of non-coding RNAs. Most recent programs for RNA-RNA interaction prediction programs are based on Turner Energy Model. Some papers show that the free energy of RNA-structures is lower than random sequences but it is not statistically significant. It shows that we may need to modify the energy model for different RNA structures applications. In this paper, we first study the RNA-RNA interaction pattern using experimental validated RNA-RNA interaction data, which are extracted from sRNATarBase. We study the sRNA-mRNA interaction data and extract some features of the RNA-RNA interaction patterns. Then we combine these features about interaction sites into the Turner Energy Model. We develop a genetic algorithm based program RIPGA to solve the RNA-RNA interaction prediction problem. We use genetic algorithm because the RNA-RNA interaction prediction is NP-hard and we are interested to find out good suboptimal solutions. We use an sRNA-mRNA interaction dataset to evaluate the performance of the modified energy model and compare the results with two state-of-the-art programs. The comparison of the original model and the modified model shows that the modified energy model has better performance in both sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Comparing RIPGA with state-of-the-art programs, RIPGA have better sensitivity and comparable positive predictive value.	genetic algorithm;interaction design pattern;interaction energy;logic programming;value (computer science)	Kwan-Yau Cheung;Kwok-Kit Tong;Kin-Hong Lee;Kwong-Sak Leung	2013	2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)	10.1109/CIBCB.2013.6595401	biology;biochemistry;rna;genetic algorithm;computer science;bioinformatics;genetics;molecular biophysics	Comp.	9.226512427622099	-59.77892333247267	126829

Sites undergoing RNA editing evolve at a higher rate than sites not modified by the process. As a result, editing sites strongly affect the evolution of plant mitochondrial genomes, representing an important source of sequence variability and potentially informative characters. To date no clear and convincing evidence has established whether or not editing sites really affect the topology of reconstructed phylogenetic trees. For this reason, we investigated here the effect of RNA editing on the tree building process of twenty different plant mitochondrial gene sequences and by means of computer simulations. Based on our simulation study we suggest that the editing ‘noise’ in tree topology inference is mainly manifested at the cDNA level. In particular, editing sites tend to confuse tree topologies when artificial genomic and cDNA sequences are generated shorter than 500 bp and with an editing percentage higher than 5.0%. Similar results have been also obtained with genuine plant mitochondrial genes. In this latter instance, indeed, the topology incongruence increases when the editing percentage goes up from about 3.0 to 14.0%. However, when the average gene length is higher than 1,000 bp (rps3, matR and atp1) no differences in the comparison between inferred genomic and cDNA topologies could be detected. Our findings by the here reported in silico and in vivo computer simulation system seem to strongly suggest that editing sites contribute in the generation of misleading phylogenetic trees if the analyzed mitochondrial gene sequence is highly edited (higher than 3.0%) and reduced in length (shorter than 500 bp). In the current lack of direct experimental evidence the results presented here encourage, thus, the use of genomic mitochondrial rather than cDNA sequences for reconstructing phylogenetic events in land plants.	amino acids;anatomy, regional;codon (nucleotide sequence);computer simulation;dna, complementary;genome;genome, mitochondrial;inference;information;personality character;phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;rna editing;rna, mitochondrial;spatial variability;transcription, genetic;tree network;trees (plant);video-in video-out	Ernesto Picardi;Carla Quagliariello	2008	BMC Bioinformatics	10.1186/1471-2105-9-S2-S14	computer simulation;biology;phylogenetic tree;rna;amino acid;mitochondrial dna;dna microarray;bioinformatics;rna editing;genetics	Comp.	4.128026812764007	-60.396548877211835	127048

Several members of this family are known to cause disease in animals and human. In particular there are several lines of evidence for involvement in human cancer and autoimmune conditions. Although this group of viruses has been investigated intensively for several decades molecular mechanisms and roles in the development of associated diseases are not yet fully understood. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology allow to incorporate current knowledge with high throughput Omics data to analyze them in the context of molecular networks. Among the applications of this development, effects of pathogen proteins and non-coding RNAs can be more readily understood by viewing their human targets in their functional-dependency network. Combination of generated networks with disease specific transcriptomics data allows to analyze the effect of pathogen proteins in the context of medically relevant phenomena. Additional enrichment with drug-target information allows generating new hypotheses for drug re-use or drug repositioning of currently available drugs to treat herpes virus associated diseases. Here we show publicly available Epstein-Barr virus data in the context of a meta-network which combines a proprietary human interaction network (omicsNET), drug-target networks, host-pathogen networks and orthology networks. EBV, a clinically relevant human Lymphocryptovirus, is of high immunological interest also due to its potential to bias natural immune responses by establishing (life-long) latent infection in memory B-cells. We thereby exemplify implications of a Systems view for better understanding of pathogen mode of action. Our work towards a methodological basis for selection of drugs which could be of interest in the treatment of this class of pathogens is presented. While investigating options for development of novel therapies we place particular focus on the application potentials of Systems Biology for selection of candidate vaccine targets in light of chronic infections not amenable to classical vaccination strategies.	bioinformatics;dna computing;exemplification;functional dependency;gene ontology term enrichment;interaction network;omics;systems biology;throughput	Andreas Heinzel;Johannes Söllner;Suszan Szathmary	2010		10.1145/1854776.1854898	high-throughput screening;biology;interpersonal relationship;targeted drug delivery;immune system;pathology;molecular mechanics;biological classification;toxicology;computer science;bioinformatics;virology;non-coding rna;functional dependency;immunology;genetics;systems biology;mode of action	Comp.	6.822062177346913	-60.32674288745847	127072
f4b5858517c9a5bd0f2a3b5d49d3e1eddc3a4f83	prediction of functional types of ligands for g protein-coupled receptors with dynamically discriminable states embedded in low dimension		In principle, the differential dynamics of a protein perturbed by various ligands should be able to reflect ligands’ different functions. However, in the field of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the phenomenon of conformational heterogeneity, i.e., the sharing of conformations traversed by differently liganded receptors, poses a challenge for delineating ligand’s action on perturbing protein dynamics. In a previous work, we have conduct multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the agonists- and antagonists-bound human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) starting from an intermediate state conformation to maximize the sensitivity of ligand-perturbed dynamics. Conformational heterogeneity can be visualized directly by the Markov state model (MSM) analysis, which is a two-stage procedure first by performing clustering based on conformational similarity to form microstates and then kinetic lumping based on state inter-convertibility to aggregate microstates into macrostates. To delineate the geometric properties of these macrostates, we embedded them onto the low dimensional space constructed with a non-linear dimensionality reduction scheme. While the crystal structures of the G-protein coupled receptor in different states (fully active, intermediate, inactive) can be projected onto divisible regions in the first two dimensions of the isomap embedding, conformations from three “purer” states (agonist-enriched, apo-enriched, antagonist-enriched) cannot be very clearly separated with this two-dimensional embedding. Dimensionality higher than two may still be needed to specify dynamically discriminable states even with nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques.	embedded system	Yu-Hsuan Chen;Jung-Hsin Lin	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16480-9_60	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology	Logic	8.832480002194924	-64.19875430405882	127165

In consequence, glycosylation is usually studied after decomposition of the intact proteins to the proteolytic peptide level. However, by this approach all information about the combination of the different glycopeptides in the intact protein is lost. In this study we have, therefore, attempted to combine the results of glycan identification after tryptic digestion with molecular mass measurements on the intact glycoproteins. Despite the extremely high number of possible combinations of the glycans identified in the tryptic peptides by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (> 1000 for hCGα and > 10.000 for hCG-β), the mass spectra of intact hCG-α and CG-β revealed only a limited number of glycoforms present in hCG preparations from pools of pregnancy urines. Peak annotations for hCG-α  were performed with the help of an algorithm that generates a database containing all possible modifications of the proteins (inclusive possible artificial modifications such as oxidation or truncation) and subsequent searches for combinations fitting the mass difference between the polypeptide backbone and the measured molecular masses. Fourteen different glycoforms of CG-α, including methionine-oxidized and N-terminally truncated forms, were readily identified. For hCG-β, however, the relatively high mass accuracy of ± 5 Da was still insufficient to unambiguously assign the possible combinations of posttranslational modifications. Finally, the mass spectrometric fingerprints of the intact molecules were shown to be very useful for the characterization of glycosylation patterns in different CG preparations.

The model accounts for the promoter open complex formation and includes alternative pathways to elongation, namely pausing, arrest, misincorporation and editing, pyrophosphorolysis, and premature termination. We confront the dynamics of this detailed model with a single-step multi-delayed stochastic model and with measurements of expression of a repressed gene at the single molecule level. At low expression rates both models match the experiments but, at higher rates the two models differ significantly, with consequences to cell-to-cell phenotypic variability. The alternative pathway reactions, due to, for example, causing polymerases to collide more often on the template, are the cause for the difference in dynamical behaviors. Next, we confront the model with measurements of the transcriptional dynamics at the single RNA level of an induced gene and show that RNA production, besides its bursting dynamics, also exhibits pulses (2 or more RNAs produced in intervals smaller than the smallest interval between initiations). The distribution of occurrences and amplitudes of pulses match the experimental measurements. This pulsing and the noise at the elongation stage are shown to play a role in the dynamics of a genetic switch.	clinical use template;exhibits as topic;experiment;gene regulatory network;heart rate variability;medical transcription;nucleotides;numerous;rna;transcription (software);transcription, genetic	Andre S.

A challenge for any system is to filter the signal from the corrupting noise. This task is particularly acute for the signal transduction network that mediates bacterial chemotaxis, because the signals are subtle, the noise arising from stochastic fluctuations is substantial, and the system is effectively acting as a differentiator which amplifies noise. Here, we investigated the filtering properties of this biological system. Through simulation, we first show that the cutoff frequency has a dramatic effect on the chemotactic efficiency of the cell. Then, using a mathematical model to describe the signal, noise, and system, we formulated and solved an optimal filtering problem to determine the cutoff frequency that bests separates the low-frequency signal from the high-frequency noise. There was good agreement between the theory, simulations, and published experimental data. Finally, we propose that an elegant implementation of the optimal filter in combination with a differentiator can be achieved via an integral control system. This paper furnishes a simple quantitative framework for interpreting many of the key notions about bacterial chemotaxis, and, more generally, it highlights the constraints on biological systems imposed by noise.	biological system;chemotaxis;control system;differentiator;filter (signal processing);mathematical model;noise (electronics);scientific publication;signal transduction;simulation;stochastic process;transduction (machine learning)	Burton W.

However, this remains a partial view, and little is known how duplicated genes diverge in non-coding regions, which can play an important role in the evolutionary preservation of duplicated genes. Here we compared the evolutionary rates of different parts of of duplicated genes in the human and mouse genomes, including 5'-UTRs, coding regions, 3'-UTRs, and 500 bps upstream and downstram of the untranslated regions. Results show that compared to orthologous genes, the ratios of the genetic distance of noncoding regions such as UTRs and upstream and downstream regions vs. synonymous substitutions tend to be smaller in paralogous genes, suggesting that synonymous substitutions benefit more greatly from relaxed selective constraints than noncoding regions. Moreover, we also examined the most frequent types of rate comparison among different genic regions in both orthologs and paralogs and found that the ranks of the most frequent types of rate comparison differ little between human paralogs and mouse paralogs, but differ greatly from those in orthologs, suggesting that duplication enables changes of evolutionary dynamics along different parts of genes. We also classified duplicated genes into three categories based on their chromosomal locations, tandem duplicates, intra-chromosomal duplicates, and inter-chromosomal duplicates. Results show that in both the human and mouse, selective constraint (measured by  K   a  / K   s  ) on intra-chromosomal duplicates tends to be much lower than that on tandem duplicates, which in turn is significantly lower than that on inter-chromosomal duplicates. This shows that genomic location is an important factor in determining the evolutionary divergence of duplicated genes.	homology (biology);sequence homology	Deng Pan;Liqing Zhang	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85984-0_116	genetic distance;bioinformatics;evolutionary dynamics;untranslated region;tandem exon duplication	Theory	4.069634320254642	-61.93437265245649	128020

The formation of biofilm, for example, allows persisting in times of external stresses, e.g. induced by antibiotics or a lack of nutrients. Adhesive curli fibers, the major extracellular matrix components in Escherichia coli biofilms, exhibit heterogeneous expression in isogenic cells exposed to identical external conditions. The dynamical mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity remain poorly understood. In this work, we elucidate the potential role of post-translational bistability as a source for this heterogeneity. We introduce a structured modelling workflow combining logical network topology analysis with time-continuous deterministic and stochastic modelling. The aim is to evaluate the topological structure of the underlying signalling network and to identify and analyse model parameterisations that satisfy observations from a set of genetic knockout experiments. Our work supports the hypothesis that the phenotypic heterogeneity of curli expression in biofilm cells is induced by bistable regulation at the post-translational level. Stochastic modelling suggests diverse noise-induced switching behaviours between the stable states, depending on the expression levels of the c-di-GMP-producing (diguanylate cyclases, DGCs) and -degrading (phosphodiesterases, PDEs) enzymes and reveals the quantitative difference in stable c-di-GMP levels between distinct phenotypes. The most dominant type of behaviour is characterised by a fast switching from curli-off to curli-on with a slow switching in the reverse direction and the second most dominant type is a long-term differentiation into curli-on or curli-off cells. This behaviour may implicate an intrinsic feature of the system allowing for a fast adaptive response (curli-on) versus a slow transition to the curli-off state, in line with experimental observations. The combination of logical and continuous modelling enables a thorough analysis of different determinants of bistable regulation, i.e. network topology and biochemical kinetics, and allows for an incorporation of experimental data from heterogeneous sources. Our approach yields a mechanistic explanation for the phenotypic heterogeneity of curli fiber expression. Furthermore, the presented work provides a detailed insight into the interactions between the multiple DGC- and PDE-type enzymes and the role of c-di-GMP in dynamical regulation of cellular decisions.	3',5'-cyclic-gmp phosphodiesterases;anatomy, regional;bistability;experiment;extracellular matrix;gnu multiple precision arithmetic library;genetic heterogeneity;genetic translation process;interaction;kinetics internet protocol;knockout;microbial biofilms;network topology;nutrients;phenotype;stochastic modelling (insurance);thyristor;tissue fiber;biological signaling;curli;phosphoric diester hydrolase	Kaveh Yousef;Adam Streck;Christof Schütte;Heike Siebert;Regine Hengge;Max von Kleist	2015		10.1186/s12918-015-0183-x	biology;bioinformatics;bacteriology;microbiology;biofilm;genetics;systems biology	ML	7.338695676889271	-64.34851896799236	128853

Results were as follows: 1.5 mmol/L oleic oil had an inhibiting effect on the cell viability; oleic oil could induce the goose hepatocytic steatosis and the increase of TG content and lipid droplet. Oleic oil all could increase the mRNA level of PPAR ; 0.5 mmol/L oleic oil could increase the mRNA level of PPAR , but 1.0 mmol/L and 1.5 mmol/L oleic oil had no evident effect. Conclusion: in the model of oleic oil induced goose hepatocytic steatosis, the change of PPAR and PPAR expression level is favor of the balance of lipids metabolism in hepatocytes, and this may be related to the capability of keeping normal physiological function in the hepatic steatosis in waterfowl.

2009940d3eb8ef524823c10848447fd65d54f3cf	rna interference and register machines (extended abstract)		RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism whereby small RNAs (siRNAs) directly control gene expression without assistance from proteins. This mechanism consists of interactions between RNAs and small RNAs both of which may be single or double stranded. The target of the mechanism is mRNA to be degraded or aberrated, while the initiator is double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to be cleaved into siRNAs. Observing the digital nature of RNAi, we represent RNAi as a Minsky register machine such that (i) The two registers hold single and double stranded RNAs respectively, and (ii) Machine’s instructions are interpreted by interactions of enzyme (Dicer), siRNA (with RISC complex) and polymerization (RdRp) to the appropriate registers. Interpreting RNAi as a computational structure, we can investigate the computational meaning of RNAi, especially its complexity. Initially, the machine is configured as a Chemical Ground Form (CGF), which generates incorrect jumps. To remedy this problem, the system is remodeled as recursive RNAi, in which siRNA targets not only mRNA but also the machine instructional analogues of Dicer and RISC. Finally, probabilistic termination is investigated in the recursive RNAi system.	interaction;interference (communication);recursion;register machine;scsi initiator and target	Masahiro Hamano	2012		10.4204/EPTCS.100.8	bioinformatics;small interfering rna	PL	5.805816811617215	-61.53319068411033	129198

We use a computational method to analyze promoters from a given genome. Our approach is based on a physical model at the mesoscopic level of protein-DNA interaction based on the influence of DNA local conformation on the dynamics of a general particle along the chain. Following the proposed model, the joined dynamics of the protein particle and the DNA portion of interest, only characterized by its base pair sequence, is simulated. The simulation output is analyzed by generating and analyzing the Free Energy Landscape of the system. In order to prove the capacity of prediction of our computational method we have analyzed nine promoters of Anabaena PCC 7120. We are able to identify the transcription starting site of each of the promoters as the most populated macrostate in the dynamics. The developed procedure allows also to characterize promoter macrostates in terms of thermo-statistical magnitudes (free energy and entropy), with valuable biological implications. Our results agree with independent previous experimental results. Thus, our methods appear as a powerful complementary tool for identifying protein binding sites in promoter sequences.	base pairing;benzalkonium chloride 1.3 mg/ml topical foam;binding sites;mesoscopic physics;population;portable c compiler;propionic acidemia;protein–dna interaction;simulation;transcription (software);cyanobacterial symbiont my2 (host: mycale sp.);dna binding;free energy;promoter	Rafael Tapia-Rojo;Juan José Mazo;José Ángel Hernández;María Luisa Peleato;María F.

These molecules freely diffuse from the environment into the cell. The circuit detects acyl-homoserine lactone ligand molecules, determines if the molecular concentration falls within two prespecified thresholds, and reports the outcome with a fluorescent protein. In the analysis of the circuit and the description of preliminary experimental results, we demonstrate how to adjust the concentration band thresholds by altering the kinetic properties of specific genetic elements, such as ribosome binding site efficiencies or dna-binding protein affinities to their operators.	artificial gene synthesis;gene regulatory network;interaction;sensor;signal processing;simulation;synthetic intelligence;telecommunications link	Subhayu Basu;David K.

The translation product of this mRNA in micrococcal nuclease treated reticulocyte lysate was identified as AFP by specific immunoprecipitation, SDS-gel electrophoresis and tryptic digestion analysis. DNA complimentary to AFP mRNA was synthesized with avian meyloblastosis virus RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. This AFP cDNA was used as a probe to quantitate AFP mRNA in the developing rat liver and to compare the complexity and diversity of AFP mRNA derived from the normal rat liver and Morris hepatoma 7777. We found that the amount of functional AFP mRNA is decreasing during liver development. There is very little, if any, AFP mRNA in the adult rat liver. A high degree of homology between the AFP mRNA sequences of yolk sac and hepatoma was also found.	2',5'-oligoadenylate;apple filing protocol;aves;cellulose;chromatography, affinity;dec alpha;dna, complementary;gel electrophoresis (lab technique);homologous gene;homology (biology);liver carcinoma;liver diseases;lysate;micrococcal nuclease;murine sarcoma viruses;oligo primer analysis software;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis;processor affinity;protein digestion (research activity);rna;reticulocytes;tryptic digestion;yolk sac	J.

This method involves selection of variants of the protein which retain function, followed by statistical analysis comparing expected and observed mutation frequencies of each residue. Resultant mutability indices for each residue are averaged across a specified window of codons to identify hypomutable regions of the protein. As originally described, the effect of changes to the length of this averaging window was not fully eludicated. In addition, it was unclear when sufficient functional variants had been examined to conclude that residues conserved in all variants have important functional roles. We demonstrate that the length of averaging window dramatically affects identification of individual hypomutable regions and delineation of region boundaries. Accordingly, we devised a region-independent chi-square analysis that eliminates loss of information incurred during window averaging and removes the arbitrary assignment of window length. We also present a method to estimate the probability that conserved residues have not been mutated simply by chance. In addition, we describe an improved estimation of the expected mutation frequency. Overall, these methods significantly extend the analysis of unigenic evolution data over existing methods to allow comprehensive, unbiased identification of domains and possibly even individual residues that are essential for protein function.	codon (nucleotide sequence);evolution;genome encoded entity;hearing loss, high-frequency;immutable object;randomness;resultant;staphylococcal protein a;window function	Colleen D.

0b558f4e8ce0d29a4f5c596486b86663c39b2cc5	the hasp motif: a new type of rna tertiary interactions		RNA structural motifs are recurrent structural elements occurring in RNA molecules. They play essential roles in consolidating RNA tertiary structures and in binding proteins. Recently, we discovered a new type of RNA structural motif, namely the hasp motif, from 27 RNA molecules. The hasp motif comprises three nucleotides which form a structure similar to a hasp. Two consecutive nucleotides in the motif come from a double helix and the third one comes from a remote stand. The hasp motif makes two helices approach each other, which leads to RNA structure folding. All the identified hasp motifs reveal a consensus structural pattern although their sequences are not conserved. Hasp motifs are observed to reside both inside and on the surface of RNA molecules. Those inside RNA molecules help consolidate RNA tertiary structures while the others locating on the surface are evidenced to interact with proteins. The wide existence of hasp motifs indicates that hasp motifs are quite essential in both keeping RNA structures’ stableness and helping RNA perform their functions in biological processes.	interaction;name binding;sequence motif;strand (programming language);structural pattern	Ying Shen;Lin Zhang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-63312-1_39	rna;pattern recognition;dna-binding protein;nucleotide;motif (music);artificial intelligence;helix;computer science;nucleic acid structure;structural motif;bioinformatics	Comp.	5.40170967458039	-62.659008031294455	130307

Therefore, managing the speed and allocation of resources is subject to tight control. From bacteria to humans, clusters of relatively rare tRNA codons at the N'-terminal of mRNAs have been implicated in attenuating the process of ribosome allocation, and consequently the translation rate in a broad range of organisms. The current interpretation of """"slow"""" tRNA codons does not distinguish between protein translations mediated by free- or endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound ribosomes. We demonstrate that proteins translated by free- or ER-bound ribosomes exhibit different overall properties in terms of their translation efficiency and speed in yeast, fly, plant, worm, bovine and human. We note that only secreted or membranous proteins with a Signal peptide (SP) are specified by segments of """"slow"""" tRNA at the N'-terminal, followed by abundant codons that are considered """"fast."""" Such profiles apply to 3100 proteins of the human proteome that are composed of secreted and signal peptide (SP)-assisted membranous proteins. Remarkably, the bulks of the proteins (12,000), or membranous proteins lacking SP (3400), do not have such a pattern. Alternation of """"fast"""" and """"slow"""" codons was found also in proteins that translocate to mitochondria through transit peptides (TP). The differential clusters of tRNA adapted codons is not restricted to the N'-terminal of transcripts. Specifically, Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are unified by clusters of low adapted tRNAs codons at the C'-termini. Furthermore, selection of amino acids types and specific codons was shown as the driving force which establishes the translation demands for the secretory proteome. We postulate that """"hard-coded"""" signals within the secretory proteome assist the steps of protein maturation and folding. Specifically, """"speed control"""" signals for delaying the translation of a nascent protein fulfill the co- and post-translational stages such as membrane translocation, proteins processing and folding."""	allocation;amino acids;biologic development;cattle;cell secretion;codon (nucleotide sequence);endoplasmic reticulum;erdős–rényi model;genetic translation process;glycosylphosphatidylinositols;hard coding;language translations;peptide phi;proteome;ribosomes;signal peptides;tissue membrane;transcript;protein maturation	Shelly Mahlab;Michal Linial	2014		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003294	biology;biochemistry;molecular biology;bioinformatics;proteome;genetics	Comp.	5.077304342605786	-62.509597804031074	130424

The ligands have between four (dimethylsulphoxide) and eleven (5-diethylamino-2-pentanone) non-hydrogen atoms, and an affinity for FKBP ranging from 20 to 0.2 mM. The conformations of the FKBP/ligand complex saved along multiple trajectories (50 runs at 310 K for each ligand) are grouped according to a set of intermolecular distances into nodes of a network, and the direct transitions between them are the links. The network analysis reveals that the bound state consists of several subbasins, i.e., binding modes characterized by distinct intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. The dissociation kinetics show a simple (i.e., single-exponential) time dependence because the unbinding barrier is much higher than the barriers between subbasins in the bound state. The unbinding transition state is made up of heterogeneous positions and orientations of the ligand in the FKBP active site, which correspond to multiple pathways of dissociation. For the six small ligands of FKBP, the weaker the binding affinity the closer to the bound state (along the intermolecular distance) are the transition state structures, which is a new manifestation of Hammond behavior. Experimental approaches to the study of fragment binding to proteins have limitations in temporal and spatial resolution. Our network analysis of the unbinding simulations of small inhibitors from an enzyme paints a clear picture of the free energy landscape (both thermodynamics and kinetics) of ligand unbinding.	benzalkonium chloride 1.3 mg/ml topical foam;bound state;dimethyl sulfoxide;distance;genetic heterogeneity;hydrogen;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;ligands;molecular dynamics;processor affinity;rem sleep behavior disorder;simulation;social network analysis;spontaneous order;tacrolimus binding proteins;thermodynamics;exponential;free energy	Danzhi Huang;Amedeo Caflisch	2011		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002002	protein folding;biochemistry;enzyme;water;plasma protein binding;molecular dynamics;image resolution;bound state;network analysis;active site;transition state;ligand;hydrogen bond;binding protein;kinetics	Comp.	8.852444439384918	-64.16387960577295	130587

Two main pathways are involved. One pathway depends on the genes SHORTROOT and SCARECROW and the other depends on the PLETHORA genes, which have been proposed to constitute the auxin readouts. Recent evidence suggests that a regulatory circuit, composed of WOX5 and CLE40, also contributes to the SCN maintenance. Yet, we still do not understand how the niche is dynamically maintained and patterned or if the uncovered molecular components are sufficient to recover the observed gene expression configurations that characterize the cell types within the root SCN. Mathematical and computational tools have proven useful in understanding the dynamics of cell differentiation. Hence, to further explore root SCN patterning, we integrated available experimental data into dynamic Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) models and addressed if these are sufficient to attain observed gene expression configurations in the root SCN in a robust and autonomous manner. We found that an SCN GRN model based only on experimental data did not reproduce the configurations observed within the root SCN. We developed several alternative GRN models that recover these expected stable gene configurations. Such models incorporate a few additional components and interactions in addition to those that have been uncovered. The recovered configurations are stable to perturbations, and the models are able to recover the observed gene expression profiles of almost all the mutants described so far. However, the robustness of the postulated GRNs is not as high as that of other previously studied networks. These models are the first published approximations for a dynamic mechanism of the A. thaliana root SCN cellular pattering. Our model is useful to formally show that the data now available are not sufficient to fully reproduce root SCN organization and genetic profiles. We then highlight some experimental holes that remain to be studied and postulate some novel gene interactions. Finally, we suggest the existence of a generic dynamical motif that can be involved in both plant and animal SCN maintenance.	approximation;autonomous robot;cell differentiation process;dynamical system;gene expression;gene regulatory network;interaction;motif;niche blogging;scientific publication;stem cell niche;stem cells;structure of suprachiasmatic nucleus;mutant	Eugenio Azpeitia;Mariana Benítez;Iliusi Vega;Carlos Villarreal;Elena R.

These reactions can be designed to proceed with designed rate and molecular specificity. By also controlling diffusion by partial complementarity to a stationary, cross-linked DNA, we can generate predictable patterns. We demonstrate this with several simulations showing deterministic, predictable shapes in space.	complementarity theory;dna breaks, single-stranded;displacement mapping;duplex (telecommunications);reversible computing;scalability;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;stationary process;strand (programming language);strand displacement	Peter B.

It is considered that p53 would be a target for therapeutic and mitigative radioprotection to escape from the apoptotic fate. So far, only three radioprotective p53 inhibitors have been reported, namely, pifithrin-α (PFTα), pifithrin-μ (PFTμ), and sodium orthovanadate (vanadate), which protect mice from acute lethality due to hematopoietic syndrome, indicating that pharmacologically temporary suppression of p53 effectively minimize the radiation damage. In this study, we examined the inhibitory activity of some zinc(II) chelators against radiation-induced apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells, based on the assumption that the binding of these compounds to zinc(II) in p53 proteins or removal of zinc(II) from the protein would temporally inhibit the function of p53. However, we have had some problems. The development of drug has been slow, due to the time required and the high cost of screening candidate compounds. It is possible to efficiently search for drugs by using machine learning. So we predict compounds that radioprotectors using Random Forest to study compound futures and using other machine learning methods for comparison with Random Forest. Procedure of learning is as follows: First, compounds were divided into several groups based on the toxicity and protection capability. Next, it was performed classification using machine learning. These results may contribute to discover of new radioprotectors.	futures and promises;machine learning;random forest;zero suppression	Atsushi Matsumoto;Tadasuke Ito;Yurie Nishi;Tatsuro Teraoka;Shin Aoki;Hayato Ohwada	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359941	random forest;toxicology;computer science;machine learning;immunology	Comp.	8.770967469737812	-60.97836823950457	131549

In this study, a bacterium isolated from a plant material compost pile was found to possess quorum sensing activity based on bioassay screening. Isolate YL12 was identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and molecular typing using rpoD gene which identified the isolate as Aeromonas caviae. High resolution tandem mass spectrometry was subsequently employed to identify the N-acyl homoserine lactone profile of Aeromonas caviae YL12 and confirmed that this isolate produced two short chain N-acyl homoserine lactones, namely C4-HSL and C6, and the production was observed to be cell density-dependent. Using the thin layer chromatography (TLC) bioassay, both AHLs were found to activate C. violaceum CV026, whereas only C6-HSL was revealed to induce bioluminescence expression of E. coli [pSB401]. The data presented in this study will be the leading steps in understanding the role of quorum sensing in Aeromonas caviae strain YL12.	activation action;acyl-homoserine lactones;aeromonas punctata (organism);biological assay;bioluminescence test;cell communication;cenchrus violaceus;gene expression;molecular typing;multi-level cell;repetitive strain;spectrometry, mass, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization;tandem mass spectrometry;thin layer chromatography;acyl-coa dehydrogenase;biological signaling;homoserine lactone;quorum sensing	Yan-Lue Lim;Robson Ee;Wai-Fong Yin;Kok Gan Chan	2014		10.3390/s140407026	biochemistry;matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization;chemistry;bioinformatics	HCI	5.512226513247665	-63.808304129989544	131891

One intriguing unanswered question is the explanation of the emergence of the glucostatic role of insulin in mammals. To find out whether this is due to the development of new sets of signaling transduction elements in these organisms, or to the establishment of new interactions between pre-existing proteins, we rebuilt putative orthologous ISPs in 17 eukaryotic organisms. Then, we computed the conservation of orthologous ISPs at different levels, from sequence similarity of orthologous proteins to co-evolution of interacting domains. We found that the emergence of glucostatic role in mammals can neither be explained by the development of new sets of signaling elements, nor by the establishment of new interactions between pre-existing proteins. The comparison of orthologous IRS molecules indicates that only in mammals have they acquired their complete functionality as efficient recruiters of effector sub-pathways.	cell signaling;emergence;evolution;gene regulatory network;insulin/insulin receptor signaling pathway;interaction;mammals;sequence similarity;sequence homology;signal transduction pathways;transduction (machine learning)	Janet Piñero González;Olimpia Carrillo Farnés;Ana Tereza Ribeiro de Vasconcelos;Abel González Pérez	2009	Bio Systems	10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.06.003	biology;biochemistry;bioinformatics;insulin receptor;comparative genomics;genetics;signal transduction	Comp.	6.682968199223144	-62.45781187682359	131994

We investigated the biological significance of eukaryotic pseudouridine synthases using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The deletant strains displayed different alteration in growth properties, including in some cases enhanced growth and/or biphasic growth curves not seen in wild-type strains under matched conditions. These results demonstrate that disrupting pseudouridine synthases can have a significant qualitative effect on growth. We further investigated the significance of post-transcriptional pseudouridine modification through investigation of the scientific literature.

Dioxin responsive elements (DREs), the specific sites responsible for expression regulation of the genes involved in the cell response to dioxin, were found in these gene regions. Thus, the role of dioxin in activity regulation of the genes involved in development of the immune response can be regulated both directly, by the transcription complex containing dioxin as a ligand, and indirectly, via intrinsic transcription factors.The double regulation, via DRE and the binding sites for the corresponding transcription factors in the promoter regions of macrophage genes, and the interregulation of the genes providing for the immune response allow the system to rapidly respond to a provocative agent (xenobiotic) and finely tune its function.

On implanted materials, these foreign body-type giant cells (FBGC) are associated with material degradation and device failure. Thus, formation of multinucleated cells is of relevance for the biomaterials field, particularly for the design of novel strategies for bone regeneration. After cell differentiation on varying conditions, multinucleation is analyzed by an independent observer and the percentage of fusion quantified. However, this analysis is still mostly performed manually, being time consuming and prone to errors.	blob detection;delaunay triangulation	Luís Ferro;Pedro Leal;Marco Marques;Joana Maciel;Marta I.

0f8540b0c98c13c0002b3be3a2c9d0cf37ddd446	importance of the rearrangement rates on the organization of genome transcription		The organization of genomes shows striking differences among the different life forms. These differences come along with important variations in the way genomes are transcribed, operon structures being frequent in short genomes and the exception in large ones, while ncRNAs are frequent in large genomes but rare in short ones. Here, we use the digital genetics model “aevol” to explore the influence of the mutation rates on these structures, showing that their diversity can be accurately reproduced when varying the rearrangement rate. This result points us to the mutational burden hypothesis as one of the main explanation. In this view, a specific level of mutational robustness indirectly leads to genome and transcriptome streamlining.	emergence;experiment;hotspot (wi-fi);medical transcription;robustness (computer science)	David P.

While the function of the isthmic organizer at themid-hindbrain boundary has been subject to extensive experimental studies, itremains unclear how this well-defined spatial gene expression pattern, which isessential for proper isthmic organizer function, is established during vertebratedevelopment. Because the secreted Wnt1 protein plays a prominent role in isthmicorganizer function, we focused in particular on the refinement of Wnt1gene expression in this context. We analyzed the dynamics of the corresponding murine gene regulatory network andthe related, diffusive signaling proteins using a macroscopic model for thebiological two-scale signaling process. Despite the discontinuity arisingfrom the sharp gene expression domain boundaries, we proved the existence ofunique, positive solutions for the partial differential equation system. Thisenabled the numerically and analytically analysis of the formation and stabilityof the expression pattern. Notably, the calculated expression domain ofWnt1 has no sharp boundary in contrast to experimental evidence. Wesubsequently propose a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for Wnt1miRNAs which yields the observed sharp expression domain boundaries. Weestablished a list of candidate miRNAs and confirmed their expression pattern byradioactive in situ hybridization. The miRNA miR-709 was identified as apotential regulator of Wnt1 mRNA, which was validated by luciferasesensor assays. In summary, our theoretical analysis of the gene expression pattern induction atthe mid-hindbrain boundary revealed the need to extend the model by an additionalWnt1 regulation. The developed macroscopic model of a two-scaleprocess facilitate the stringent analysis of other morphogen-based patterningprocesses.	cell secretion;cell signaling;electronic organizer;gene expression;gene regulatory network;image organizer;in situ hybridization;micrornas;nucleic acid hybridization;numerical analysis;refinement (computing);reflections of signals on conducting lines;transcription (software);transcription, genetic;vertebrates;biological signaling;hindbrain;negative regulation of production of mirnas involved in gene silencing by mirna	Sabrina Hock;Yen-Kar Ng;Jan Hasenauer;Dominik M.

In this paper we identify the allowed long-term behaviors of a multi-level, 70-node dynamic model of the stomatal opening process in plants. We start by reducing the model’s huge state space. We first reduce unregulated nodes and simple mediator nodes, then simplify the regulatory functions of selected nodes while keeping the model consistent with experimental observations. We perform attractor analysis on the resulting 32-node reduced model by two methods: 1. converting it into a Boolean model, then applying two attractor-finding algorithms; 2. theoretical analysis of the regulatory functions. We further demonstrate the robustness of signal propagation by showing that a large percentage of single-node knockouts does not affect the stomatal opening level. Combining both methods with analysis of perturbation scenarios, we conclude that all nodes except two in the reduced model have a single attractor; and only two nodes can admit oscillations. The multistability or oscillations of these four nodes do not affect the stomatal opening level in any situation. This conclusion applies to the original model as well in all the biologically meaningful cases. In addition, the stomatal opening level is resilient against single-node knockouts. Thus, we conclude that the complex structure of this signal transduction network provides multiple information propagation pathways while not allowing extensive multistability or oscillations, resulting in robust signal propagation. Our innovative combination of methods offers a promising way to analyze multi-level models.	algorithm;anatomic node;behavior;biological system;cell signaling;mathematical model;mediator brand of benfluorex hydrochloride;multi-level governance;multilevel model;numerous;phenotype;software propagation;standard boolean model;state space;transduction (machine learning);stomatal opening	Xiao Gan;Réka Albert	2016		10.1186/s12918-016-0327-7	computational biology;biology;computer science;bioinformatics;theoretical computer science;systems biology	ML	6.624667452394805	-59.13385421918993	133549

The results agree with binding and electrophysiological data for the interaction of mutant (125)I-PcTx1Y(N) with rASIC1a chimeras and PcTx1 itself with hASIC1a chimeras. They go even farther by revealing that only two hASIC1a subunits can be directly involved in the binding, to which four domains - instead of the only two identified by the experiments - participate.

It is now clear that analytical chemistry alone is insufficient to identify aquatic environments that are compromised because these measurements do not identify the biologically available dose. The biological endpoints that are measured are important because they relate to known impairments; however, they are not specific to the contaminants and often focus on only a few known endpoints. These studies can be enhanced by looking more broadly at changes in gene expression, especially if the analysis focuses on biochemical pathways. The present study was designed to obtain additional information for well-characterized sites adjacent to sewage treatment plants in MN that are thought to be impacted by endocrine disruptors. Here we examine five sites that have been previously characterized and examine changes in gene expression in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) that have been caged for 48 h in each of the aquatic environments. We find that the gene expression changes are characteristic and unique at each of the five sites. Also, fish exposed to two of the sites, 7 and 12, present a more aggressive behavior compared to control fish. Our results show that a short-term exposure to sewage treatment plant effluents was able to induce a site-specific gene expression pattern in the fathead minnow gonad and liver. The short-term exposure was also enough to affect fish sexual behavior. Our results also show that microarray analysis can be very useful at determining potential exposure to chemicals, and could be used routinely as a tool for environmental monitoring.	aquatic ecosystem;dosage forms;endocrine system diseases;gene expression profiling;gonadal structure;gyrodactylus sp.

In our group we have developed a very simple screening function (referred to as solvent accessibility free energy of binding predictor, SAFE_p) which we have applied previously to the study of peptidic HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) inhibitors and later to cyclic urea type HIV-1 PR inhibitors. In this work, we have extended the SAFE_p protocol to a chemically diverse set of HIV-1 PR inhibitors with binding constants that differ by several orders of magnitude. The resulting function is able to reproduce the ranking and in many cases the value of the inhibitor binding affinities for the HIV-1 PR, with accuracy comparable with that of costlier protocols. We also demonstrate that the binding pocket SAFE_p analysis can contribute to the understanding of the physical forces that participate in ligand binding. The analysis tools afforded by our protocol have allowed us to identify an induced fit phenomena mediated by the inhibitor and have demonstrated that larger fragments do not necessarily contribute the most to the binding free energy, an outcome partially brought about by the substantial role the desolvation penalty plays in the energetics of binding. Finally, we have revisited the effect of the Asp dyad protonation state on the predicted binding affinities."""	accessibility;alzheimer's disease;aspartate;aspartic acid proteases;broadly neutralizing hiv-1 antibodies;calpain;chemical structure;endopeptidases;energy, physics;genetic heterogeneity;hiv;kerrison predictor;large;ligands;mathematical optimization;national origin;penalty method;processor affinity;protocols documentation;protons;score;urea;free energy;negative regulation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel activity;orders - hl7publishingdomain;p16 protease, human immunodeficiency virus 1;piperazine;secretase	Miguel Arenas;M.

The first step in this quantification is the enumeration of stoichiometries of all reactions occurring in a metabolic network. The structural details of the network in combination with experimentally observed accumulation rates of external metabolites can yield flux distribution at steady state. One such methodology for quantification is the use of elementary modes, which are minimal set of enzymes connecting external metabolites. Here, we have used a linear objective function subject to elementary modes as constraint to determine the fluxes in the metabolic network of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The feasible phenotypic space was evaluated at various combinations of oxygen and ammonia uptake rates. Quantification of the fluxes of the elementary modes in the metabolism of C. glutamicum was formulated as linear programming. The analysis demonstrated that the solution was dependent on the criteria of objective function when less than four accumulation rates of the external metabolites were considered. The analysis yielded feasible ranges of fluxes of elementary modes that satisfy the experimental accumulation rates. In C. glutamicum, the elementary modes relating to biomass synthesis through glycolysis and TCA cycle were predominantly operational in the initial growth phase. At a later time, the elementary modes contributing to lysine synthesis became active. The oxygen and ammonia uptake rates were shown to be bounded in the phenotypic space due to the stoichiometric constraint of the elementary modes. We have demonstrated the use of elementary modes and the linear programming to quantify a metabolic network. We have used the methodology to quantify the network of C. glutamicum, which evaluates the set of operational elementary modes at different phases of fermentation. The methodology was also used to determine the feasible solution space for a given set of substrate uptake rates under specific optimization criteria. Such an approach can be used to determine the optimality of the accumulation rates of any metabolite in a given network.	advanced telecommunications computing architecture;ammonia;biomass;carbon dioxide;contribution;converge;convergence (action);corynebacterium glutamicum;corynebacterium spp toxin:prthr:pt:xxx:ord:immune diffusion;estradiol;experiment;fbxo3 gene;feasible region;form-based authentication;glycolysis;kasparov's gambit;linear programming;loss function;lysine biosynthesis pathway;manuscripts;mathematical optimization;matrix representation;metabolite;optimization problem;oxygen;quantitation;steady state;the matrix;tree accumulation;wdfy2 wt allele;citation;lysine 6-aminotransferase;negative regulation of mitotic cell cycle dna replication	Kalyan Gayen;Kareenhalli V.

This approach concerned some specific types of replacement and the mechanisms that can be involved in their control. The usefulness of the Markovian model for interpretation of mutational replacement within homologous proteins was examined. The same sequences were also analyzed with the use of the non-Markovian algorithm of genetic semihomology. This study leads to the conclusion that the Markovian model is not suitable for the interpretation of protein mutational variability since: (1) The information about the history of a variable unit is included in its genetic code. (2) This information plays an important role in the probability of further possible changes of the unit.	alignment;amino acids;genetic algorithm;heart rate variability;hereditary diseases;homology (biology);hypothetical protein;protein family;spatial variability;surgical replantation;peptidase activity	Jacek Leluk	2000	Computers & chemistry	10.1016/S0097-8485(00)00070-X	mutation;biology;biochemistry;bioinformatics;genetic code;protein family;genetics	Comp.	4.832209873835553	-61.230214676747416	134284

By regulating the access of biological machineries to underlying cis-regulatory elements, its mobility has been implicated in many important cellular processes. Although it has been known that various factors, such as DNA sequences, histone modifications, etc., cooperatively affect nucleosome mobility, the contribution of each factor in the common impact remains unclear. We propose, in this work, a novel computational approach based on multiple kernel learning for quantitatively assessing the effects of two important factors, i.e., genomic sequence and post-translational histone modifications (PTMs), on nucleosome dynamics. Our result on Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that, epigenetic feature, such as histone modifications, plays more important role than genomic sequence in regulating nucleosome dynamics. Based on that, we carried further analysis on each PTM to reveal their combinatory effects on nucleosome dynamics and found out that some pairs of PTMs such as H3K9Ac–H4H14Ac, H4K5Ac–H4K12Ac and H4K5Ac–H3K14Ac might co-operate in altering nucleosome stability in gene regulation.

Here we use homology interface modeling of 10 Ras-effector complexes by selecting ortholog proteins from 12 organisms representing the major eukaryotic branches, except plants. We find that with increasing divergence time the sequence similarity decreases with respect to the human protein, but the affinities and association rate constants are conserved as predicted by the protein design algorithm, FoldX. In parallel we have done computer simulations on a minimal network based on Ras-effector interactions, and our results indicate that in the absence of negative feedback, changes in kinetics that result in similar binding constants have strong consequences on network behavior. This, together with the previous results, suggests an important biological role, not only for equilibrium binding constants but also for kinetics in signaling processes involving Ras-effector interactions. Our findings are important to take into consideration in system biology approaches and simulations of biological networks.	algorithm;biological network;computer simulation;conserved sequence;foldx;homologous gene;homology (biology);interaction;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;nash equilibrium;negative feedback;orthologous gene;pierre robin syndrome;sequence alignment;systems biology	Christina Kiel;Dorothee Aydin;Luis Serrano	2008	PLoS Computational Biology	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000245	computer simulation;biology;bioinformatics;signal processing;conserved sequence;genetics	Comp.	7.148812563095391	-63.767733277650215	135002

Sets of random sequences or identically repeated sequences, for example, would be expected to contribute little or no useful information to a cell. This issue of quantitation of information is important since the ebb and flow of biologically significant information is essential to our quantitative understanding of biological function and evolution. Motivated specifically by these problems of biological information, we propose here a class of measures to quantify the contextual nature of the information in sets of objects, based on Kolmogorov’s intrinsic complexity. Such measures discount both random and redundant information and are inherent in that they do not require a defined state space to quantify the information. The maximization of this new measure, which can be formulated in terms of the universal information distance, appears to have several useful and interesting properties, some of which we illustrate with examples.	expectation–maximization algorithm;function (biology);living systems;state space	David J.

632040d2750b072a5d33ff19bdca5bfc2365a83a	exploration and stabilization of ras1 mating zone: a mechanism with positive and negative feedbacks		In mating fission yeast cells, sensing and response to extracellular pheromone concentrations occurs through an exploratory Cdc42 patch that stochastically samples the cell cortex before stabilizing towards a mating partner. Active Ras1 (Ras1-GTP), an upstream regulator of Cdc42, and Gap1, the GTPase-activating protein for Ras1, localize at the patch. We developed a reaction-diffusion model of Ras1 patch appearance and disappearance with a positive feedback by a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) and Gap1 inhibition. The model is based on new estimates of Ras1-GDP, Ras1-GTP and Gap1 diffusion coefficients and rates of cytoplasmic exchange studied by FRAP. The model reproduces exploratory patch behavior and lack of Ras1 patch in cells lacking Gap1. Transition to a stable patch can occur by change of Gap1 rates constants or local increase of the positive feedback rate constants. The model predicts that the patch size and number of patches depend on the strength of positive and negative feedbacks. Measurements of Ras1 patch size and number in cells overexpressing the Ras1 GEF or Gap1 are consistent with the model.	coefficient;constraint (computer-aided design);estimated;f factor;fraps;graphical editing framework;guanine nucleotide exchange factors;nucleotides;patch tuesday;pheromone;positive feedback;schizosaccharomyces pombe;singlet fission;cell cortex	Bita Khalili;Laura Merlini;Vincent Vincenzetti;Sophie G.

While combinatorial binding of transcription factors at promoters has been proposed as a solution for cell-type specific gene expression, we found that such models resulted in substantial information bottlenecks. We sought to understand the consequences of adopting sequential logic wherein the time-ordering of factors informs the final outcome. We showed that with noncommutative control, it is possible to independently control targets that would otherwise be activated simultaneously using combinatorial logic. Consequently, sequential logic overcomes the information bottleneck inherent in complex networks. We derived scaling laws for two noncommutative models of regulation, motivated by phosphorylation/neural networks and chromosome folding, respectively, and showed that they scale super-exponentially in the number of regulators. We also showed that specificity in control is robust to the loss of a regulator. Lastly, we connected these theoretical results to real biological networks that demonstrate specificity in the context of promiscuity. These results show that achieving a desired outcome often necessitates roundabout steps.	artificial neural network;biological network;combinational logic;complex network;gene expression profiling;heart rate variability;image scaling;institute for operations research and the management sciences;neural network simulation;roundabout;sensitivity and specificity;sequential logic;transcription factor;transcription (software);cell type;promoter	William Letsou;Long Cai	2016		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005089	phosphorylation;biology;molecular biology;regulation of gene expression;gene expression;chromatin;bioinformatics;sequence analysis;chromosome;genetics	Comp.	5.7063892417302124	-59.31112234713166	136208

Here we show that an analysis of coevolution at the residue level fully captures the characteristic large-scale conformational transitions of this protein family, and predicts an evolutionary conserved-and thus functional-homo-dimeric arrangement. Furthermore, we highlight that the features encoding the Hsp70 dimer are more conserved in bacterial than in eukaryotic sequences, suggesting that the known Hsp70/Hsp110 hetero-dimer is a eukaryotic specialization built on a pre-existing template.	clinical use template;conserved sequence;dna sequence rearrangement;domino tiling;molecular chaperones;partial template specialization;protein family	Duccio Malinverni;Simone Marsili;Alessandro Barducci;Paolo De Los Rios	2015		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004262	biology;molecular biology;bioinformatics;sequence alignment;peptide sequence;genetics	Comp.	5.861060468847147	-62.49529763018001	136234

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of in vitro selected populations offers a large scale method to study RNA-proteins interactions. However, most existing analysis methods require that the binding motifs are enriched in the population relative to earlier rounds, and that motifs are found in a loop or single stranded region of the potential RNA secondary structure. Such methods do not generalize to all RNA-protein interaction as some RNA binding proteins specifically recognize more complex structures such as double stranded RNA. In this study, we use HT-SELEX derived populations to study the landscape of RNAs that interact with Geobacillus kaustophilus ribosomal protein S15. Our data show high sequence and structure diversity and proved intractable to existing methods. Conventional programs identified some sequence motifs, but these are found in less than 5-10% of the total sequence pool. Therefore, we developed a novel framework to analyze HT-SELEX data. Our process accounts for both sequence and structure components by abstracting the overall secondary structure into smaller substructures composed of a single base-pair stack, which allows us to leverage existing approaches already used in k-mer analysis to identify enriched motifs. By focusing on secondary structure motifs composed of specific two base-pair stacks, we identified significantly enriched or depleted structure motifs relative to earlier rounds. Discrete substructures are likely to be important to RNA-protein interactions, but they are difficult to elucidate. Substructures can help make highly diverse sequence data more tractable. The structure motifs provide limited accuracy in predicting enrichment suggesting that G. kaustophilus S15 can either recognize many different secondary structure motifs or some aspects of the interaction are not captured by the analysis. This highlights the importance of considering secondary and tertiary structure elements and their role in RNA-protein interactions.	abstract summary;biopolymer sequencing;cobham's thesis;double-blind method;gene ontology term enrichment;high-throughput satellite;hyper-threading;hypertensive disease;hypotrichosis simplex;interaction;k-mer;mer;name binding;population;protein domain;rna binding;ribosomal proteins;sequence motif;small;throughput;tertiary	Shermin Pei;Betty L.

478e42edc40111d8b1372b23d3ddcfa6a7d17676	stemcellckb: an integrated stem cell-specific chemogenomics knowledgebase for target identification and systems-pharmacology research		Given the capacity of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation, stem cells are promising sources for use in regenerative medicines as well as in the clinical treatment of certain hematological malignancies and degenerative diseases. Complex networks of cellular signaling pathways largely determine stem cell fate and function. Small molecules that modulate these pathways can provide important biological and pharmacological insights. However, it is still challenging to identify the specific protein targets of these compounds, to explore the changes in stem cell phenotypes induced by compound treatment and to ascertain compound mechanisms of action. To facilitate stem cell related small molecule study and provide a better understanding of the associated signaling pathways, we have constructed a comprehensive domain-specific chemogenomics resource, called StemCellCKB ( http://www.cbligand.org/StemCellCKB/ ). This new cloud-computing platform describes the chemical molecules, genes, proteins, and signaling pathways implicated in stem cell regulation. StemCellCKB is also implemented with web applications designed specifically to aid in the identification of stem cell relevant protein targets, including TargetHunter, a machine-learning algorithm for predicting small molecule targets based on molecular fingerprints, and HTDocking, a high-throughput docking module for target prediction and systems-pharmacology analyses. We have systematically tested StemCellCKB to verify data integrity. Target-prediction accuracy has also been validated against the reported known target/compound associations. This proof-of-concept example demonstrates that StemCellCKB can (1) accurately predict the macromolecular targets of existing stem cell modulators and (2) identify novel small molecules capable of probing stem cell signaling mechanisms, for use in systems-pharmacology studies. StemCellCKB facilitates the exploration and exchange of stem cell chemogenomics data among members of the broader research community.	abnormal degeneration;algorithm;automatic differentiation;cell signaling;chembl;cheminformatics;chemogenomics;cloud computing;data integrity;database;databases;docking (molecular);drug design;endocrine system diseases;fifty nine;fingerprint;forty nine;hematologic neoplasms;high-throughput computing;journal of chemical information and modeling;mandibular right second molar tooth;mental association;natural science disciplines;organizing (structure);pharmacology;phenotype;pubchem;regenerative medicine;server (computing);small molecule;stem cells;systems biology;throughput;united states national institutes of health;web application;x image extension	Yu Zhang;Lirong Wang;Zhiwei Feng;Haizi Cheng;Terence Francis McGuire;Yahui Ding;Tao Cheng;Yingdai Gao;Xiang-Qun Xie	2016	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00748	pharmacology;biology;toxicology;bioinformatics	Comp.	7.166609136631941	-59.78998228912981	136686

Here we present a population of hiPSC-CM models, calibrated using six different experimental datasets. By sampling the maximum conductances of 11 ionic currents, 10000 parameter sets were obtained. The experimental data-based calibration selected 1355 in silico models to be included in the final population. Such population reproduces the experimental data variability and it is used to assess the different responses to a 90% IKr block. Three different profiles emerged: models still normally beating (562), action potentials with EADs (336) and repolarization failures (457). The models still beating after 800 s since IKr block showed a mean ΔAPD90 of 723±12 ms. We observed significant differences among these three classes in the maximum conductances of ICaL, IKr, IKs, IK1, INaCa and INaK, supporting the idea that hiPSC-CM belonging to the same control population can however show dramatically different responses to an external perturbation, due to the physiological variability. This has to be taken in proper consideration in the perspective of using hiPSC-CMs for safety pharmacology assays.	action potential;heart rate variability;ionic;sampling (signal processing);spatial variability	Michelangelo Paci;Elisa Passini;Stefano Severi;Jari Hyttinen;Blanca E.

81d9521f89f875ba3bb8f30d3865a94f07d8c225	functional mapping of ontogeny in flowering plants		All organisms face the problem of how to perform a sequence of developmental changes and transitions during ontogeny. We revise functional mapping, a statistical model originally derived to map genes that determine developmental dynamics, to take into account the entire process of ontogenetic growth from embryo to adult and from the vegetative to reproductive phase. The revised model provides a framework that reconciles the genetic architecture of development at different stages and elucidates a comprehensive picture of the genetic control mechanisms of growth that change gradually from a simple to a more complex level. We use an annual flowering plant, as an example, to demonstrate our model by which to map genes and their interactions involved in embryo and postembryonic growth. The model provides a useful tool to study the genetic control of ontogenetic growth in flowering plants and any other organisms through proper modifications based on their biological characteristics.	angiosperms;control system;embryo;growth;interaction;persistent vegetative state;reproduction;revision procedure;statistical model	Xiyang Zhao;Chunfa Tong;Xiaoming Pang;Zhong Wang;Yunqian Guo;Fang Du;Rongling Wu	2012	Briefings in bioinformatics	10.1093/bib/bbr054	biology;botany;ecology	Comp.	4.379048556537293	-61.10369257754504	137062

Particularly, controlling the abundance of proteins that may have detrimental effects on cell growth is crucial for rapid recovery from stress-induced quiescence.   RESULTS Prompted by qualitative modeling of the nutrient starvation response in yeast, we investigated in vivo the effect of proteolysis after nutrient starvation showing that, for the Gis1 transcription factor at least, proteasome-mediated control is crucial for a rapid return to growth. Additional bioinformatics analyses show that potentially toxic transcriptional regulators have a significantly lower protein half-life, a higher fraction of unstructured regions and more potential PEST motifs than the non-detrimental ones. Furthermore, inhibiting proteasome activity tends to increase the expression of genes induced during the Environmental Stress Response more than those in the rest of the genome. Our combined results suggest that proteasome-mediated proteolysis of potentially toxic transcription factors tightly modulates the stress response in yeast.

16d7a5b73a1ad67d88b261308fc6e019863162a7	on the origin of dna genomes: evolution of the division of labor                     between template and catalyst in model replicator systems	dna;transcription genetic;evolution molecular;protein function;computer model;templates genetic;dna replication;genetics;models genetic;chemical properties;rna;rna world;surface model;genome;compartment model;genome evolution;division of labor;catalytic activity	The division of labor between template and catalyst is a fundamental property of all living systems: DNA stores genetic information whereas proteins function as catalysts. The RNA world hypothesis, however, posits that, at the earlier stages of evolution, RNA acted as both template and catalyst. Why would such division of labor evolve in the RNA world? We investigated the evolution of DNA-like molecules, i.e. molecules that can function only as template, in minimal computational models of RNA replicator systems. In the models, RNA can function as both template-directed polymerase and template, whereas DNA can function only as template. Two classes of models were explored. In the surface models, replicators are attached to surfaces with finite diffusion. In the compartment models, replicators are compartmentalized by vesicle-like boundaries. Both models displayed the evolution of DNA and the ensuing division of labor between templates and catalysts. In the surface model, DNA provides the advantage of greater resistance against parasitic templates. However, this advantage is at least partially offset by the disadvantage of slower multiplication due to the increased complexity of the replication cycle. In the compartment model, DNA can significantly delay the intra-compartment evolution of RNA towards catalytic deterioration. These results are explained in terms of the trade-off between template and catalyst that is inherent in RNA-only replication cycles: DNA releases RNA from this trade-off by making it unnecessary for RNA to serve as template and so rendering the system more resistant against evolving parasitism. Our analysis of these simple models suggests that the lack of catalytic activity in DNA by itself can generate a sufficient selective advantage for RNA replicator systems to produce DNA. Given the widespread notion that DNA evolved owing to its superior chemical properties as a template, this study offers a novel insight into the evolutionary origin of DNA.	anatomical compartments;biological evolution;class;clinical use template;computational model;genome;living systems;models of dna evolution;multi-compartment model;multiplication;parasites;rna;replicator (stargate);vesicle (morphologic abnormality);enzyme activity;parasitism	Nobuto Takeuchi;Paulien Hogeweg;Eugene V.

This is achieved via the cell division cycle, which is driven by the sequential accumulation and destruction of cyclins. The regulatory network around these cyclins, particularly in G1, has been interpreted as a size control network in budding yeast, and cell size as being decisive for the START transition. However, it is not clear why disruptions in the G1 network may lead to altered size rather than loss of size control, or why the S-G2-M duration also depends on nutrients. With a mathematical population model comprised of individually growing cells, we show that cyclin translation would suffice to explain the observed growth rate dependence of cell volume at START. Moreover, we assess the impact of the observed bud-localisation of the G2 cyclin CLB2 mRNA, and find that localised cyclin translation could provide an efficient mechanism for measuring the biosynthetic capacity in specific compartments: The mother in G1, and the growing bud in G2. Hence, iteration of the same principle can ensure that the mother cell is strong enough to grow a bud, and that the bud is strong enough for independent life. Cell sizes emerge in the model, which predicts that a single CDK-cyclin pair per growth phase suffices for size control in budding yeast, despite the necessity of the cell cycle network around the cyclins to integrate other cues. Size control seems to be exerted twice, where the G2/M control affects bud size through bud-localized translation of CLB2 mRNA, explaining the dependence of the S-G2-M duration on nutrients. Taken together, our findings suggest that cell size is an emergent rather than a regulatory property of the network linking growth and proliferation.	anabolism;bud - chv concept;bud - plant part;cdk;cell cycle;cell division;cyclins;emergence;equilibrium;gene regulatory network;gnutella2;iteration;mathematics;nutrients;population model;saccharomycetales;stem cells;tree accumulation;cell growth;establishment and maintenance of localization;physical hard work	Thomas W.

Automated and reliable tracking of centrosomes is essential for genetic screens that study the process of centrosome assembly and maturation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.   RESULTS We have developed a fully automatic system for tracking and measuring fluorescently labeled centrosomes in 3D time-lapse images of early C. elegans embryos. Using a spinning disc microscope, we monitor the centrosome cycle in living embryos from the 1- up to the 16-cell stage at imaging intervals between 30 and 50 s. After establishing the centrosome trajectories with a novel method involving two layers of inference, we also automatically detect the nuclear envelope breakdown in each cell division and recognize the identities of the centrosomes based on the invariant cell lineage of C. elegans. To date, we have tracked centrosomes in over 500 wild type and mutant embryos with almost no manual correction required.

The model shows that ligand water desolvation and lipophilicity are the dominant processes governing the DNA intercalation of TPZ analogues, consistent with DFT modelling of the complexes formed by TPZ analogues with neutral and N-protonated acridine moieties which intercalate with the guanine DNA nucleobases.

Among all encoded phenotypes, cell population growth rate (fitness) is perhaps the most important, since it determines how well-adapted a genotype is in various environments. Traditional biological measurement techniques have revealed the connection between the environment and fitness based on the gene expression mean. Yet, recently it became clear that cells with identical genomes exposed to the same environment can differ dramatically from the population average in their gene expression and division rate (individual fitness). For cell populations with bimodal gene expression, this difference is particularly pronounced, and may involve stochastic transitions between two cellular states that form distinct sub-populations. Currently it remains unclear how a cell population's growth rate and its subpopulation fractions emerge from the molecular-level kinetics of gene networks and the division rates of single cells. To address this question we developed and quantitatively characterized an inducible, bistable synthetic gene circuit controlling the expression of a bifunctional antibiotic resistance gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Following fitness and fluorescence measurements in two distinct environments (inducer alone and antibiotic alone), we applied a computational approach to predict cell population fitness and subpopulation fractions in the combination of these environments based on stochastic cellular movement in gene expression space and fitness space. We found that knowing the fitness and nongenetic (cellular) memory associated with specific gene expression states were necessary for predicting the overall fitness of cell populations in combined environments. We validated these predictions experimentally and identified environmental conditions that defined a """"sweet spot"""" of drug resistance. These findings may provide a roadmap for connecting the molecular-level kinetics of gene networks to cell population fitness in well-defined environments, and may have important implications for phenotypic variability of drug resistance in natural settings."""	antibiotic resistance, microbial;artificial gene synthesis;experiment;fluorescence;gene expression profiling;gene expression programming;gene regulatory network;genome;heart rate variability;kinetics internet protocol;nih roadmap initiative tag;organism;phenotype;population;synthetic intelligence	Dmitry Nevozhay;Rhys M.

We describe the graph theoretical identification and searching of highly hydrogen bonded base triples, where each base is involved in at least two hydrogen bonds with the other bases. Our approach correlates theoretically predicted base triples with literature-based compilations and other actual occurrences in crystal structures. The use of ‘fuzzy’ search tolerances has enabled us to discover a number of triple interaction types that have not been previously recorded nor predicted theoretically. Comparative analyses of different ribosomal RNA structures reveal several conserved base triple motifs in 50S rRNA structures, indicating an important role in structural stabilization and ultimately RNA function.	approximate string matching;base;catalytic rna;crystal structure;graph - visual representation;graph theory;hydrogen;interaction;triple des;tertiary	Mohd Firdaus Raih;Anne-Marie Harrison;Peter Willett;Peter J.

However, the significance of distribution preference has not been completely understood. Completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequencing allows us to better understand and characterize microsatellites.   RESULTS Microsatellite distribution was more abundant in 5'-flanking regions of genes compared with that expected in the whole genome, with an over-representation of AG and AAG repeats; there were clear differences from distributions in 3'-flanks and coding fractions, where triplet frequencies evidently corresponded to codon usage. We identified 1140 full-length genes that contained at least one locus of AG or AAG repeats in their upstream sequences, and whose functional characteristics were significantly associated with the repeats. This observation indicates that selective pressure markedly differed in the three transcribed regions, with positive selection of AG and AAG repeats in 5'-flanks close to those genes whose products are preferentially involved in transcription.	antigens;codon (nucleotide sequence);contain (action);locus;mpg gene;pierre robin syndrome;short tandem repeat;transcription (software);triplet state;whole genome sequencing	Lida Zhang;Dejun Yuan;Shunwu Yu;Zhugang Li;Youfang Cao;Zhiqi Miao;Hongmei Qian;Kexuan Tang	2004	Bioinformatics	10.1093/bioinformatics/bth043	distribution;biology;molecular biology;codon usage bias;whole genome sequencing;bioinformatics;direct repeat;sequencing;gene;microsatellite;coding;genetics;tandem repeat;directional selection;genome	Comp.	3.9302880126720043	-63.150301729462015	137952

Unlocking its genetic regulation will provide insight towards understanding its influence on pathogenesis, formation of biofilms, and many other phenotypes. There are few datasets available that link QS-mediated gene expression to its regulatory components and even fewer mathematical models that incorporate known mechanistic detail. By integrating these data with annotated sequence information, mathematical inferences can be pieced together that shed light on regulatory structure. A first principles model, developed here for the E. coli QS system, builds on known mechanistic detail and is used to develop a working model of LuxS-regulated (Lsr) activity. That is, our model is meant to discriminate among hypothetical mechanisms governing lsr transcriptional regulation. Our simulations are in qualitative agreement with experimentally observed data. Importantly, our results point to the importance of transcriptional regulator, LsrR, cycling on genetic control. We also found several experimental observations in E. coli and homologous systems that were not explained by current mechanistic understanding. For example, by comparing simulations with reports of the integrating host factor in Aggrigatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, we conclude that additional transcriptional components are likely involved. An iterative process of simulation and experiment, therefore, is needed to inform new experiments and incorporate new model detail, the benefit of which will more rapidly validate mechanistic understanding.	cell secretion;cell signaling;experiment;gene expression regulation;homology (biology);iteration;mathematical model;mathematics;microbial biofilms;phenotype;regulated rewriting;simulation;transcription, genetic;transcriptional regulation;derepression;quorum sensing;ribosylhomocysteinase activity	Steven M.

Instead, each collecting lymphatic vessel can individually contract and dilate producing unidirectional flow enforced by intraluminal check valves. Due to the large number and spatial distribution of such pumps, high-level coordination would be unwieldy. This leads to the question of how each segment of lymphatic vessel responds to local signals that can contribute to the coordination of pumping on a network basis. Beginning with elementary fluid mechanics and known cellular behaviors, we show that two complementary oscillators emerge from i) mechanical stretch with calcium ion transport and ii) fluid shear stress induced nitric oxide production (NO). Using numerical simulation and linear stability analysis we show that the newly identified shear-NO oscillator shares similarities with the well-known Van der Pol oscillator, but has unique characteristics. Depending on the operating conditions, the shear-NO process may i) be inherently stable, ii) oscillate spontaneously in response to random disturbances or iii) synchronize with weak periodic stimuli. When the complementary shear-driven and stretch-driven oscillators interact, either may dominate, producing a rich family of behaviors similar to those observed in vivo.	behavior;blood circulation;calcium;centralized computing;computer simulation;dilate procedure;high- and low-level;interstitial fluid;interstitial webpage;ions;iontophoresis;lymphatic system;lymphatic vessel tumors;mechanics;nitric oxide;oscillator device component;pumping (computer systems);van der pol oscillator;video-in video-out;whole earth 'lectronic link;pump (device);shear stress	James W.

In particular many Cx26 alterations are strongly associated to human deafness. Calcium plays an important role on this structures regulation. Here, using calcium as a probe, extensive atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed on the Cx26 hemichannel embedded in a lipid bilayer. Exploring different initial conditions and calcium concentration, simulation reached ∼4 μs. Several analysis were carried out in order to reveal the calcium distribution and localization, such as electron density profiles, density maps and distance time evolution, which is directly associated to the interaction energy. Specific amino acid interactions with calcium and their stability were capture within this context. Few of these sites such as, GLU42, GLU47, GLY45 and ASP50, were already suggested in the literature. Besides, we identified novel calcium biding sites: ASP2, ASP117, ASP159, GLU114, GLU119, GLU120 and VAL226. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these sites are reported within this context. Furthermore, since various pathologies involving the Cx26 hemichannel are associated with pathogenic variants in the corresponding CJB2 gene, using ClinVar, we were able to spatially associate the 3D positions of the identified calcium binding sites within the framework of this work with reported pathogenic variants in the CJB2 gene. This study presents a first step on finding associations between molecular features and pathological variants of the Cx26 hemichannel.		Juan M. R. Albano;Nahuel Mussini;Roxana Toriano;Julio C.

However, opposing conclusions were drawn from these studies. Computational chemistry analysis of these models indicates that the carboxylate ion plays an insignificant role in the former model because of the correct orientation and the distance of the imidazole group without the carboxylate ion. However, in the latter model, the carboxylate ion serves to orient and place the imidazole group at the correct position. This analysis suggests that an important role of the carboxylate ion in serine proteases is to position the imidazole group to be an effective general base catalyst.	computational chemistry	Weida Tong;Valerian T.

58c71ff7341aaa61b7b7501191a033323e6dfde0	deppdb - dna electrostatic potential properties database: electrostatic properties of genome dna		The electrostatic properties of genome DNA influence its interactions with different proteins, in particular, the regulation of transcription by RNA-polymerases. DEPPDB--DNA Electrostatic Potential Properties Database--was developed to hold and provide all available information on the electrostatic properties of genome DNA combined with its sequence and annotation of biological and structural properties of genome elements and whole genomes. Genomes in DEPPDB are organized on a taxonomical basis. Currently, the database contains all the completely sequenced bacterial and viral genomes according to NCBI RefSeq. General properties of the genome DNA electrostatic potential profile and principles of its formation are revealed. This potential correlates with the GC content but does not correspond to it exactly and strongly depends on both the sequence arrangement and its context (flanking regions). Analysis of the promoter regions for bacterial and viral RNA polymerases revealed a correspondence between the scale of these proteins' physical properties and electrostatic profile patterns. We also discovered a direct correlation between the potential value and the binding frequency of RNA polymerase to DNA, supporting the idea of the role of electrostatics in these interactions.

Lack of the effective antiviral therapy endorses the urgency for the development of vaccine against these deadly viruses. In this study, we employed various computational approaches to identify epitopes which has the potential for vaccine development. By analyzing the immune parameters of the conserved sequences of G glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential epitopes which may be used as peptide vaccines. Using different B cell epitope prediction servers, four highly similar B cell epitopes were identified. Immunoinformatics analyses revealed that LAEDDTNAQKT is a highly flexible and accessible B-cell epitope to antibody. Highly similar putative CTL epitopes were analyzed for their binding with the HLA-C 12*03 molecule. Docking simulation assay revealed that LTDKIGTEI has significantly lower binding energy, which bolstered its potential as epitope-based vaccine design. Finally, cytotoxicity analysis has also justified their potential as promising epitope-based vaccine candidate. In sum, our computational analysis indicates that either LAEDDTNAQKT or LTDKIGTEI epitope holds a promise for the development of universal vaccine against all kinds of pathogenic Henipavirus. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to validate the obtained findings.		Md.

Several different experimental models have been used as a proxy for human infection, including cell cultures derived from human cells, mice, and non-human primates. Each of these systems has been studied extensively in isolation, but little effort has been directed toward systematically characterizing the conservation of host response on a global level beyond known immune signaling cascades. In the present study, we employed a multivariate modeling approach to characterize and compare the transcriptional regulatory networks between these three model systems after infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype. Using this approach we identified functions and pathways that display similar behavior and/or regulation including the well-studied impact on the interferon response and the inflammasome. Our results also suggest a primary response role for airway epithelial cells in initiating hypercytokinemia, which is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses. We further demonstrate that we can use a transcriptional regulatory model from the human cell culture data to make highly accurate predictions about the behavior of important components of the innate immune system in tissues from whole organisms. This is the first demonstration of a global regulatory network modeling conserved host response between in vitro and in vivo models.	advance directive - proxy;aves;body tissue;cell culture techniques;cell signaling;h5n2 avian influenza virus;immune response;immune system;inflammasomes;influenza a virus, avian;influenza in birds;macaca;murine sarcoma viruses;orthomyxoviridae;primates;transcription, genetic;video-in video-out;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jason E.

51d1a847db6274cbfe3586af451839ae18011b28	updated and standardized genome-scale reconstruction of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, iek1011, simulates flux states indicative of physiological conditions	antibiotic resistance;environmental condition;genome-scale reconstruction;m. tuberculosis	The efficacy of antibiotics against M. tuberculosis has been shown to be influenced by experimental media conditions. Investigations of M. tuberculosis growth in physiological conditions have described an environment that is different from common in vitro media. Thus, elucidating the interplay between available nutrient sources and antibiotic efficacy has clear medical relevance. While genome-scale reconstructions of M. tuberculosis have enabled the ability to interrogate media differences for the past 10 years, recent reconstructions have diverged from each other without standardization. A unified reconstruction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv would elucidate the impact of different nutrient conditions on antibiotic efficacy and provide new insights for therapeutic intervention. We present a new genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, named iEK1011, that unifies and updates previous M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome-scale reconstructions. We functionally assess iEK1011 against previous models and show that the model increases correct gene essentiality predictions on two different experimental datasets by 6% (53% to 60%) and 18% (60% to 71%), respectively. We compared simulations between in vitro and approximated in vivo media conditions to examine the predictive capabilities of iEK1011. The simulated differences recapitulated literature defined characteristics in the rewiring of TCA metabolism including succinate secretion, gluconeogenesis, and activation of both the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. To assist efforts to elucidate mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development, we curated 16 metabolic genes related to antimicrobial resistance and approximated evolutionary drivers of resistance. Comparing simulations of these antibiotic resistance features between in vivo and in vitro media highlighted condition-dependent differences that may influence the efficacy of antibiotics. iEK1011 provides a computational knowledge base for exploring the impact of different environmental conditions on the metabolic state of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. As more experimental data and knowledge of M. tuberculosis H37Rv become available, a unified and standardized M. tuberculosis model will prove to be a valuable resource to the research community studying the systems biology of M. tuberculosis.

Although many ion channels have been characterized the functional implications of particular combinations and the regulatory mechanisms controlling their expression are often difficult to assess in vivo and remain unclear. We introduce a method, Reverse Channel Identification (RCI), which enables the numbers and mixture of active ion channels to be determined. We devised a currentclamp stimulus that allows each channels characteristics to be determined. We test our method on simulated data from a computational model of squid giant axons and from fly photoreceptors to identify both the numbers of ion channels and their specific ratios. Our simulations suggest that RCI is a robust method that will allow identification of ion channel number and mixture in vivo.	computation;computational model;neuron;return channel;simulation;video-in video-out	A.

Especially unclear is the relative role of intrinsic factors of present-day proteins versus historical factors such as protein age. Here we study the interplay of structural properties and evolutionary age, as determinants of protein evolutionary rate. We use a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins, with mapped PDB structures. We report that previously observed structural correlations also hold within each age group - including relationships between solvent accessibility, designabililty, and evolutionary rates. However, age also plays a crucial role: age modulates the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate. Additionally, younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older proteins. We show that previously reported relationships between age and rate cannot be explained by structural biases among age groups. Finally, we introduce a knowledge-based potential function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation. We find that older proteins are more stable for their native structure, and more robust to mutations, than younger ones. Our results underscore that several determinants, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution.	accessibility;biological evolution;computation;evolutionary algorithm;homology (biology);modulation;mutation;one-to-one (data model);protein data bank;staphylococcal protein a;statistical potential;suppressor factors, immunologic	Macarena Toll-Riera;David L.

An alternative promising and efficient used to identify new active substances is Pharmacophore modeling method.We defined a new computational strategy protocol characterized by the use of bioinformatics online tools and by the application of locally installed tools, for lead candidates generation-optimization able to reduce the cycle time and cost of this process and to promote the next steps of study [2].Hence, we have tried to apply this new computational procedure, in a more detailed screening, of small bioactive molecules, searching and identifying new candidates as “lead compounds”, potentially able to inhibit biological target AKT1 human protein and its related molecular mechanisms [3].The workflow executed in our work has been characterized by a multi-step design, which concerns different topics: search in PDB database of a model structure for AKT1, pharmacophore modeling and virtual computational screening, biological evaluation divided in two parts (molecular validation of selected compounds and study of physical-chemical properties related to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics prediction models). All these step have been performed through PHARMIT (http://pharmit.csb.pitt.edu) and Discovery Studio 4.5 platform.We selected the PDB structure 3O96 as the reference complex (protein-ligand), and we analyzed it by means of PHARMIT and Discovery Studio, to generate four different “pharmacophore models” with four different list of natural compounds.It is performed a thorough screening of compounds applying several filters, to find some good candidates as possible natural AKT1 allosteric inhibitors.The compounds that match a well-defined pharmacophore have been analyzed through direct molecular docking, for selecting only the best candidates and studying the protein-ligand interactions. Selected compounds have been investigated in more details, to trace their origin, by their chemical-physical properties.This information can help us to predict some plausible enzyme-catalyzed reaction pathways, through PathPred web-server and KEGG compound database, in order to highlight the most important reactions for biosynthesis of compounds and obtain PharmacoKinetics/PharmacoDynamics (PK/PD) models, to investigate the ADMET properties of these lead compounds and to study their behavior in some biological systems, for the next experimental assays.This new computational strategy has been very efficient in showing what could be good “lead compounds” and potential natural inhibitors of AKT1 and PI3K/AKT1 signaling cascade. Therefore, the next steps could be the experimental analysis of pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics and toxicity properties “in vitro/in vivo”, in order to evaluate the results obtained “in silico”.	bioinformatics;biological system;computation;discovery studio;docking (molecular);interaction;kegg;mathematical optimization;pharmacophore;property (philosophy);protein data bank;public-key cryptography;server (computing);video-in video-out;web server	Serena Dotolo;Angelo M.

They are widespread in Arthropods where they display a wide range of reproductive manipulations; these can be potentially involved in the evolution of mating systems, speciation, gene acquisition and sex determination. In particular, Wolbachia is thought to infect more than 66% of insect species and is also found in nematodes. However, little is known about the dynamics of Wolbachia infections at the community level. Although at the intra-population level, invasion dynamics have been extensively studied, the same is not true at the community level, where the turnover of infections remains largely uncharacterised. How often are new infections acquired through horizontal transfers between distantly related hosts? What ecological routes are behind the movement of these parasites between hosts? These questions, crucial to assess the impact of the infections, remain unanswered. Moreover, as Wolbachia is seen as a good candidate for a transgenic vector against pests, understanding its dynamic at the community level is crucial. We propose to address them by performing an exhaustive characterisation of sexual parasites in simplified systems, using the opportunity offered by small arthropod communities in isolated islands. Our work aims at characterising geographical communities of arthropods collected from 4 young, isolated islands (less than 5 My old) and the Wolbachia infections found in these communities. Furthermore, we investigate the existing evidence for recent horizontal transfers of these symbionts between distant taxa and potential ecological routes facilitating these transmissions. vii te l-0 08 50 70 7, v er si on 1 8 Au g 20 13	host (network);vii	Patrícia Martins Simões	2012			biology;ecology;cartography	Metrics	4.334893357067811	-62.45775567643142	143205

Adrenergic receptors are grouped into three types, alpha<sub>1</sub>, alpha<sub>2</sub> and beta. Within each type, Molecular biological studies revealed further subtypes, they are designated as alpha<sub>1A</sub>, alpha<sub>1B</sub>, alpha<sub>1D</sub>, alpha<sub>2D</sub>, beta<sub>1</sub>, beta<sub>2</sub>, beta<sub>3</sub>. Biological studies found that some subtypes interact with others in certain tissues, which means there are relations between these subtypes. Currently there have been fewer reports about the relationship between adrenergic receptor subtypes with a lack of selective agonists. Here we use bioinformatics tools and strategies to study the relationship between adrenergic receptor subtypes from three aspects, including molecular evolution, sequence similarity and protein-protein interaction. Finally we find that within the alpha<sub>1</sub> three subtypes the evolution distance between alpha<sub>1A</sub> and alpha<sub>1B</sub> is relatively nearer, and their sequence similarity is higher; within the alpha<sub>2</sub> three subtypes the evolution distance between alpha<sub>2A</sub> and alpha<sub>2C</sub> is relatively nearer, and their sequence similarity is higher. From the protein-protein aspect we find that alpha<sub>1A</sub> is directly interacting with beta<sub>1</sub>, the three subtypes of alpha<sub>1</sub> as well as beta<sub>1</sub> have more interacting proteins, and hence they are more active within the body.	bioinformatics;homeostasis;homology (biology);interaction;sequence alignment	Hailong Yu;Yan Xu;Yun Xiao;Xia Li	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.740	biology;endocrinology;biochemistry;bioinformatics;alpha-1b adrenergic receptor	Visualization	6.763376317152541	-62.48658511875843	143244

The last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) had both complex spliceosomal machinery and some spliceosomal introns, yet little is known about the early stages of evolution of the spliceosomal apparatus. The Sm/Lsm family of proteins has been suggested as one of the earliest components of the emerging spliceosome and hence provides a first in-depth glimpse into the evolving spliceosomal apparatus. An analysis of 335 Sm and Sm-like genes from 80 species across all three kingdoms of life reveals two significant observations. First, the eukaryotic Sm/Lsm family underwent two rapid waves of duplication with subsequent divergence resulting in 14 distinct genes. Each wave resulted in a more sophisticated spliceosome, reflecting a possible jump in the complexity of the evolving eukaryotic cell. Second, an unusually high degree of conservation in intron positions is observed within individual orthologous Sm/Lsm genes and between some of the Sm/Lsm paralogs. This suggests that functional spliceosomal introns existed before the emergence of the complete Sm/Lsm family of proteins; hence, spliceosomal machinery with considerably fewer components than today's spliceosome was already functional.	biological evolution;cellular phone;eighty;emergence;gene duplication abnormality;homology (biology);introns;protein family;spliceosomes;intein	Stella Veretnik;Christopher Wills;Philippe Youkharibache;Ruben E.

The timing of such events is stochastic as a consequence of the innate randomness in gene expression. A question of interest is to understand how gene expression is regulated to achieve precision in event timing. To address this, we model event timing using a first-passage time framework. The protein evolution is described via a simple stochastic model of gene expression. Moreover, feedback regulation of the protein degradation is considered to be a possible noise control mechanism employed to achieve the precision. Exact analytical formulas are developed for the distribution and moments of the first-passage time. Using these expressions, we investigate for the optimal feedback strategy such that noise (coefficient of variation squared) in event timing is minimized around a given fixed mean time. Our results show that the minimum noise is achieved when the protein degradation rate is zero for all protein levels. Lastly, the implications of this finding are discussed.	coefficient;elegant degradation;first-hitting-time model;gene expression profiling;randomness	Khem Raj Ghusinga;Abhyudai Singh	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7524951	stochastic process;biology;gene expression;degradation;computer science;bioinformatics;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;protein engineering;genetics;statistics	Comp.	7.292139466635603	-65.41795646046087	143617
69d93ad1f66618105cf01939b701c34b1502dbf8	analysis of drug–endogenous human metabolite similarities in terms of their maximum common substructures	computer applications in chemistry;theoretical and computational chemistry;computational biology bioinformatics;documentation and information in chemistry	In previous work, we have assessed the structural similarities between marketed drugs ('drugs') and endogenous natural human metabolites ('metabolites' or 'endogenites'), using 'fingerprint' methods in common use, and the Tanimoto and Tversky similarity metrics, finding that the fingerprint encoding used had a dramatic effect on the apparent similarities observed. By contrast, the maximal common substructure (MCS), when the means of determining it is fixed, is a means of determining similarities that is largely independent of the fingerprints, and also has a clear chemical meaning. We here explored the utility of the MCS and metrics derived therefrom. In many cases, a shared scaffold helps cluster drugs and endogenites, and gives insight into enzymes (in particular transporters) that they both share. Tanimoto and Tversky similarities based on the MCS tend to be smaller than those based on the MACCS fingerprint-type encoding, though the converse is also true for a significant fraction of the comparisons. While no single molecular descriptor can account for these differences, a machine learning-based analysis of the nature of the differences (MACCS_Tanimoto vs MCS_Tversky) shows that they are indeed deterministic, although the features that are used in the model to account for this vary greatly with each individual drug. The extent of its utility and interpretability vary with the drug of interest, implying that while MCS is neither 'better' nor 'worse' for every drug-endogenite comparison, it is sufficiently different to be of value. The overall conclusion is thus that the use of the MCS provides an additional and valuable strategy for understanding the structural basis for similarities between synthetic, marketed drugs and natural intermediary metabolites.	fingerprint;machine learning;maximal set;membrane transport proteins;metabolite;molecular descriptor;multi categories security;synthetic intelligence	Steve O'Hagan;Douglas B.

While experimental methods can be quite successful, computational approaches can enhance discovery and guide experimentation by efficiently exploring very large design spaces. We present a computational algorithm, Predictably Profitable Path (PreProPath), to identify target pathways best suited for engineering modifications. The algorithm utilizes uncertainties about the metabolic networks operating state inherent in the underdetermined linear equations representing the stoichiometric model. Flux Variability Analysis is used to determine the operational flux range. PreProPath identifies a path that is predictable in behavior, exhibiting small flux ranges, and profitable, containing the least restrictive flux-limiting reaction in the network. The algorithm is computationally efficient because it does not require enumeration of pathways. The results of case studies show that PreProPath can efficiently analyze variances in metabolic states and model uncertainties to suggest pathway engineering strategies that have been previously supported by experimental data.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;exhibits as topic;gene regulatory network;heart rate variability;linear equation;metabolic engineering;metabolic process, cellular;nutrients;pathway analysis;synthetic biology;synthetic intelligence	Ehsan Ullah;Mark Walker;Kyongbum Lee;Soha Hassoun	2015	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics	10.1109/TCBB.2015.2394470	algorithm design;uncertainty;prediction;computer science;bioinformatics;theoretical computer science;flux balance analysis;mathematics;statistics	Comp.	6.749843009510381	-60.09588461345457	144633

858dd11327886763089eb0f75dbea0eba43d6db8	a design principle of group-level decision making in cell populations	models theoretical;cell biology	Populations of cells often switch states as a group to cope with environmental changes such as nutrient availability and cell density. Although the gene circuits that underlie the switches are well understood at the level of single cells, the ways in which such circuits work in concert among many cells to support group-level switches are not fully explored. Experimental studies of microbial quorum sensing show that group-level changes in cellular states occur in either a graded or an all-or-none fashion. Here, we show through numerical simulations and mathematical analysis that these behaviors generally originate from two distinct forms of bistability. The choice of bistability is uniquely determined by a dimensionless parameter that compares the synthesis and the transport of the inducing molecules. The role of the parameter is universal, such that it not only applies to the autoinducing circuits typically found in bacteria but also to the more complex gene circuits involved in transmembrane receptor signaling. Furthermore, in gene circuits with negative feedback, the same dimensionless parameter determines the coherence of group-level transitions from quiescence to a rhythmic state. The set of biochemical parameters in bacterial quorum-sensing circuits appear to be tuned so that the cells can use either type of transition. The design principle identified here serves as the basis for the analysis and control of cellular collective decision making.	behavior;bistability;decision making;mathematics;negative feedback;network switch;numerical analysis;population parameter;quiescence search;quorum sensing;simulation;switch device component;tagged union	Koichi Fujimoto;Satoshi Sawai	2013		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003110	biology	ML	7.460288351261395	-65.22056802473712	144999

Focus on the family of chemosensory proteins (CSPs) in insects reveals differences at the genomic level across various strains and biotypes, but none at the level of individuals, which could be extremely useful in the biotyping of insect pest species necessary for the agricultural, medical and veterinary industries. Proposed methods of genotyping CSPs include not only restriction enzymatic cleavage and amplification of cleaved polymorphic sequences, but also detection of retroposons in some specific regions of the insect chromosome. Design of biosensors using CSPs addresses tissue-specific RNA mutations in a particular subtype of the protein, which could be used as a marker of specific physiological conditions. Additionally, we refer to the binding properties of CSP proteins tuned to lipids and xenobiotic insecticides for the development of a new generation of biosensor chips, monitoring lipid blood concentration and chemical environmental pollution.	chromosomes, insect;cleaved cell;environmental pollution;genotype determination;insecticides;mutation;plague;retroposons	Guoxia Liu;Philippe Arnaud;Bernard O.

We coordinate a structural study of IspH, a [4Fe-4S] protein responsible for converting HMBPP to IPP and DMAPP in the ultimate step in the nonmevalonate pathway. By performing accelerated molecular dynamics simulations on both substrate-free and HMBPP-bound [Fe4S4](2+) IspH, we elucidate how substrate binding alters the dynamics of the protein. Using principal component analysis, we note that while substrate-free IspH samples various open and closed conformations, the closed conformation observed experimentally for HMBPP-bound IspH is inaccessible in the absence of HMBPP. In contrast, simulations with HMBPP bound are restricted from accessing the open states sampled by the substrate-free simulations. Further investigation of the substrate-free simulations reveals large fluctuations in the HMBPP binding pocket, as well as allosteric pocket openings - both of which are achieved through the hinge motions of the individual domains in IspH. Coupling these findings with solvent mapping and various structural analyses reveals alternative druggable sites that may be exploited in future drug design efforts.	3,3-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate;antimalarials;drug discovery;dynamical system;experiment;gene regulatory network;hinge device component;isoprenoids;molecular dynamics;motion;mycobacterium tuberculosis;principal component analysis;simulation;indolepropanol phosphate	Patrick G.

Creating accurate dynamic models of GRNs is gaining importance in biomedical research and development. To improve our understanding of continuous deterministic modeling methods employed to construct dynamic GRN models, we have carried out a comprehensive comparative study of three commonly used systems of ordinary differential equations: The S-system (SS), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the general rate law of transcription (GRLOT) method. These were thoroughly evaluated in terms of their ability to replicate the reference models' regulatory structure and dynamic gene expression behavior under varying conditions. While the ANN and GRLOT methods appeared to produce robust models even when the model parameters deviated considerably from those of the reference models, SS-based models exhibited a notable loss of performance even when the parameters of the reverse-engineered models corresponded closely to those of the reference models: this is due to the high number of power terms in the SS-method, and the manner in which they are combined. In cross-method reverse-engineering experiments the different characteristics, biases and idiosynchracies of the methods were revealed. Based on limited training data, with only one experimental condition, all methods produced dynamic models that were able to reproduce the training data accurately. However, an accurate reproduction of regulatory network features was only possible with training data originating from multiple experiments under varying conditions. The studied GRN modeling methods produced dynamic GRN models exhibiting marked differences in their ability to replicate the reference models' structure and behavior. Our results suggest that care should be taking when a method is chosen for a particular application. In particular, reliance on only a single method might unduly bias the results.	agent-based model;artificial neural network;biomedical research;cns disorder;exhibits as topic;experiment;grn gene;gene expression regulation;gene regulatory network;hearing loss, high-frequency;mathematical model;rna;reverse engineering;self-replicating machine;self-replication;transcription (software)	Martin T.

The almost identical protein folding of kinases and the common co-substrate ATP leads to the problem of inhibitor selectivity. Type II inhibitors, targeting the inactive conformation of kinases, occupy a hydrophobic pocket with less conserved surrounding amino acids [1]. Human polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) represents a promising target for approaches to identify new therapeutic agents. Plk1 belongs to a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases, and is a key player in mitosis, where it modulates the spindle checkpoint at metaphase/anaphase transition. Plk1 is over-expressed in all today analyzed human tumors of different origin and serves as a negative prognostic marker in cancer patients. The newly identified inhibitor, SBE13, a vanillin derivative, targets Plk1 in its inactive conformation [2]. This leads to selectivity within the Plk family and towards Aurora A. This selectivity can be explained by docking studies of SBE13 into the binding pocket of homology models of Plk1, Plk2 and Plk3 in their inactive conformation. SBE13 showed anti-proliferative effects in cancer cell lines of different origins with EC50 values between 5 μM and 39 μM and induced apoptosis. Increasing concentrations of SBE13 result in increasing amounts of cells in G2/M phase 13 hours after double thymidin block of HeLa cells. The kinase activity of Plk1 was inhibited with an IC50 of 200 pM. Taken together, we could show that carefully designed structure-based virtual screening is well-suited to identify selective type II kinase inhibitors targeting Plk1 as potential anti-cancer therapeutics.

Many such regions have been found alongside small linear binding motifs. We report a Monte Carlo study that aims to elucidate the role of disordered regions adjacent to such binding motifs. The coarse-grained simulations show that small hydrophobic peptides without disordered flanks tend to aggregate under conditions where peptides embedded in unstructured peptide sequences are stable as monomers or as part of small micelle-like clusters. Surprisingly, the binding free energy of the motif is barely decreased by the presence of disordered flanking regions, although it is sensitive to the loss of entropy of the motif itself upon binding. This latter effect allows for reversible binding of the signalling motif to the substrate. The work provides insights into a mechanism that prevents the aggregation of signalling peptides, distinct from the general mechanism of protein folding, and provides a testable hypothesis to explain the abundance of disordered regions in proteins.	aggregate data;embedded system;embedding;flank (surface region);monte carlo method;motif;peptide phi;simulation;biological signaling;free energy;monomer;protein folding	Sanne Abeln;Daan Frenkel	2008	PLoS Computational Biology	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000241	computer simulation;biology;biochemistry;protein structure;bioinformatics	Comp.	7.618686070431953	-63.74872520679466	147902

However, the mechanical and biochemical mechanisms that ensure proper feedback control of tissue growth, which when deregulated contribute to tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here we use the fly notum as a model system to identify a novel process of crowding-induced cell delamination that balances growth to ensure the development of well-ordered cell packing. In crowded regions of the tissue, a proportion of cells undergo a serial loss of cell–cell junctions and a progressive loss of apical area, before being squeezed out by their neighbours. This path of delamination is recapitulated by a simple computational model of epithelial mechanics, in which stochastic cell loss relieves overcrowding as the system tends towards equilibrium. We show that this process of delamination is mechanistically distinct from apoptosis-mediated cell extrusion and precedes the first signs of cell death. Overall, this analysis reveals a simple mechanism that buffers epithelia against variations in growth. Because live-cell delamination constitutes a mechanistic link between epithelial hyperplasia and cell invasion, this is likely to have important implications for our understanding of the early stages of cancer development.	apoptosis;buffers;carcinogenesis;cell (microprocessor);cell death;cellular phone;cessation of life;computational model;crowding;deregulation;feedback;mechanics;neoplasms;set packing;tissue growth	Eliana Marinari;Aida Mehonic;Scott Curran;Jonathan Gale;Thomas Duke;Buzz Baum	2012	Nature	10.1038/nature10984	biology;mechanism;morphogenesis;nanotechnology;developmental biology;genetics	ML	6.562941007216041	-65.71830583719945	148174

These lipid anchors serve for membrane attachment or protein-protein interactions in many pathways. Although well-tolerated selective prenyltransferase inhibitors are clinically available, their mode of action remains unclear since the known substrate sets of the various prenyltransferases are incomplete. The Prenylation Prediction Suite (PrePS) has been applied for large-scale predictions of prenylated proteins. To prioritize targets for experimental verification, we rank the predictions by their functional importance estimated by evolutionary conservation of the prenylation motifs within protein families. The ranked lists of predictions are accessible as PRENbase (http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS/PRENbase) and can be queried for verification status, type of modifying enzymes (anchor type), and taxonomic distribution. Our results highlight a large group of plant metal-binding chaperones as well as several newly predicted proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, enriching the known functional repertoire of prenylated proteins. Furthermore, we identify two possibly prenylated proteins in Mimivirus. The section HumanPRENbase provides complete lists of predicted prenylated human proteins-for example, the list of farnesyltransferase targets that cannot become substrates of geranylgeranyltransferase 1 and, therefore, are especially affected by farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) used in cancer and anti-parasite therapy. We report direct experimental evidence verifying the prediction of the human proteins Prickle1, Prickle2, the BRO1 domain-containing FLJ32421 (termed BROFTI), and Rab28 (short isoform) as exclusive farnesyltransferase targets. We introduce PRENbase, a database of large-scale predictions of protein prenylation substrates ranked by evolutionary conservation of the motif. Experimental evidence is presented for the selective farnesylation of targets with an evolutionary conserved modification site.	attachments;clinical prediction rule;conserved sequence;dimethylallyltranstransferase;elegant degradation;farnesyl transferase inhibitor;html element;motif;neoplasms;partial;protein family;rab28 gene;tissue membrane;verification and validation;verification of theories;verifying specimen;farnesyltranstransferase;protein protein interaction	Sebastian Maurer-Stroh;Manfred Koranda;Wolfgang Benetka;Georg Schneider;Fernanda L.

Inhibitors of P-gp have thus been advocated as promising candidates for overcoming the problem of MDR. However, due to lack of a high-resolution structure the concrete mode of interaction of both substrates and inhibitors is still not known. Therefore, structure-based design studies have to rely on protein homology models. In order to identify binding hypotheses for propafenone-type P-gp inhibitors, five different propafenone derivatives with known structure-activity relationship (SAR) pattern were docked into homology models of the apo and the nucleotide-bound conformation of the transporter. To circumvent the uncertainty of scoring functions, we exhaustively sampled the pose space and analyzed the poses by combining information retrieved from SAR studies with common scaffold clustering. The results suggest propafenone binding at the transmembrane helices 5, 6, 7 and 8 in both models, with the amino acid residue Y307 playing a crucial role. The identified binding site in the non-energized state is overlapping with, but not identical to, known binding areas of cyclic P-gp inhibitors and verapamil. These findings support the idea of several small binding sites forming one large binding cavity. Furthermore, the binding hypotheses for both catalytic states were analyzed and showed only small differences in their protein-ligand interaction fingerprints, which indicates only small movements of the ligand during the catalytic cycle.	amino acids;antibiotics;binding sites;cluster analysis;cyclic gmp;dental caries;docking (molecular);fingerprint;homologous gene;homology (biology);image resolution;ligands;memory data register;movement;multi-drug resistance;neoplasms;nucleotides;p-glycoprotein;p-glycoproteins;propafenone;sampling - surgical action;score;scoring functions for docking;verapamil;cancer therapy;statistical cluster	Freya Klepsch;Peter Chiba;Gerhard F.

This knowledge-based method consists of three steps: (1) generation of possible metabolites, (2) docking the predicted metabolites to the CYP binding site and (3) selection of the most probable metabolites based on their complementarity to the binding site. As a proof of concept we evaluated our method by using MetabolExpert for metabolite generation and Glide for docking into the binding site of the CYP2C9 crystal structure. Our method could identify the correct metabolite among the three best-ranked compounds in 69% of the cases. The predictive power of our knowledge-based method was compared to that achieved by substrate docking and two alternative literature approaches.	boat dock;camphor 5-monooxygenase;complementarity theory;crystal structure;default;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;entity name part qualifier - adopted;expert systems;expert system;flurbiprofen;glide;heme;iron man;knowledge-based systems;ligands;mathematical optimization;metabolic process, cellular;metabolite pool;probability;protocols documentation;rule (guideline);silo (dataset);sixty nine;algorithm;drug metabolism	Ákos Tarcsay;Robert Kiss;György M.

So far, little is known about miRNA in Solanum tuberosum species. Using previously known miRNAs from Arabidopsis, rice and other plant species against expressed sequence tags (ESTs), genomic survey sequence (GSS) and nucleotide databases, we identified 48 potential miRNAs in S. tuberosum. These potato miRNAs may regulate 186 potential targets, which are involved in floral, leaf, root, and stem development, signal transduction, metabolism pathways, and stress responses. To validate the prediction of miRNAs in potato, we performed a RT-PCR analysis and found that potato miRNAs have diverse expression patterns during development.	arabidopsis;computation;database;databases;expressed sequence tags;micrornas;nucleotides;pierre robin syndrome;rna;reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction;signal transduction;solanum tuberosum;transduction (machine learning)	Wenwei Zhang;Yuping Luo;Xi Gong;Wenhong Zeng;Siguang Li	2009	Computational biology and chemistry	10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2008.07.006	fight-or-flight response;biology;biochemistry;metabolic pathway;molecular biology;nucleotide;botany;bioinformatics;genetics;signal transduction;microrna;expressed sequence tag;transcription factor	Comp.	4.927786866938797	-61.806469854203826	149355

These terminators possess an advantage over existing reagents in that no purification is required to remove unreacted nucleotide or associated breakdown products prior to electrophoretic separation of the sequencing fragments. This obviates the need for a time consuming post-reaction work up, allowing direct loading of DNA sequencing reaction mixtures onto a slab gel. Thermo Sequenase II DNA polymerase poorly incorporates the charge-modified terminators compared with regular dye-labeled terminators. However, extending the linker arm between dye and nucleotide and using a mutant form of a related DNA polymerase can in part mitigate the decrease in substrate efficiency. We also present evidence that these charge-modified terminators can relieve gel compression artefacts when used with dGTP in sequencing reactions.	biopolymer sequencing;catabolism;circuit complexity;compression artifact;dyes;microsequencer;morphologic artifacts;nucleotides;primer;purification of quantum state;reagents;slab allocation;terminator (character concept);terminator device component;tracer;mixture	Patrick J.

2720cf98edc25359316ba78512db2b4542d57ac8	analyzing the validity of selective mutation with dominator mutants	dominator mutants;mutation analysis;subsumption	Various forms of selective mutation testing have long been accepted as valid approximations to full mutation testing. This paper presents counterevidence to traditional selective mutation. The recent development of dominator mutants and minimal mutation analysis lets us analyze selective mutation without the noise introduced by the redundancy inherent in traditional mutation. We then exhaustively evaluate all small sets of mutation operators for the Proteum mutation system and determine dominator mutation scores and required work for each of these sets on an empirical test bed. The results show that all possible selective mutation approaches have poor dominator mutation scores on at least some of these programs. This suggests that to achieve high performance with respect to full mutation analysis, selective approaches will have to become more sophisticated, possibly by choosing mutants based on the specifics of the artifact under test, that is, specialized selective mutation.	approximation;dominator (graph theory);hydrogen;mutation testing;testbed;the simpsons: bart vs. the space mutants	Bob Kurtz;Paul Ammann;A.

Antibacterial results indicated that compounds 2d, 2e, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4d and 4e showed promising activity against B. cerus, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (MIC: 6.2 μg/mL) and excellent efficacy against E. coli (MIC: 3.1 μg/mL). Furthermore, compounds 3d and 3e displayed better activity (MIC: 3.1 μg/mL) than the reference drugs chloramphenicol and cycloheximide against gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains. The compounds 3d-e also showed better activity than the reference drug paromomycin against B. cerus and P. aeruginosa and showed similar inhibition pattern against S. aureus and E. coli. (MIC: 3.1 μg/mL). Studies on fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) determination of compounds 1a-e, 2a-c, 4a-c and the reference antibiotic via combination approach revealed a synergistic effect as the MIC values were lowered up to 1/8th to 1/33rd of the original MIC. In-vitro cytotoxicity study indicated that 2-Cl-benzimidazole derivatives showed less toxicity than the reference used against PBM, CEM and Vero cell lines. Docking studies and MD simulations of compounds on bacterial protein (eubacterial ribosomal decoding A site, PDB: 1j7t) have been conducted to find the possible mode of action of the molecules. In silico ADMET evaluations of compounds 3d and 3e showed promising results comparable to the reference drugs used in this study.	4-dichlorobenzene;adverse reaction to drug;anti-bacterial agents;bacterial proteins;benzimidazoles;boat dock;carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan regimen;cerus;chloramphenicol;cultured cell line;cycloheximide;docking (molecular);ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion;evaluation;maxillary right first molar abutment;maxillary right second premolar abutment;molecular dynamics;netpbm format;paromomycin;protein data bank;pseudomonas aeruginosa;simulation;spherical basis;staphylococcus aureus;synergy;cisplatin/ifosfamide/mitomycin protocol;gram;phytobacteriomycin	Ritika Srivastava;Sunil K.

PCC6803 is a cyanobacterium considered as a candidate photo-biological production platform - an attractive cell factory capable of using CO2 and light as carbon and energy source, respectively. In order to enable efficient use of metabolic potential of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, it is of importance to develop tools for uncovering stoichiometric and regulatory principles in the Synechocystis metabolic network. We report the most comprehensive metabolic model of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 available, i Syn669, which includes 882 reactions, associated with 669 genes, and 790 metabolites. The model includes a detailed biomass equation which encompasses elementary building blocks that are needed for cell growth, as well as a detailed stoichiometric representation of photosynthesis. We demonstrate applicability of i Syn669 for stoichiometric analysis by simulating three physiologically relevant growth conditions of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and through in silico metabolic engineering simulations that allowed identification of a set of gene knock-out candidates towards enhanced succinate production. Gene essentiality and hydrogen production potential have also been assessed. Furthermore, i Syn669 was used as a transcriptomic data integration scaffold and thereby we found metabolic hot-spots around which gene regulation is dominant during light-shifting growth regimes. i Syn669 provides a platform for facilitating the development of cyanobacteria as microbial cell factories.	carbon dioxide;cyanobacteria;elementary;exanthema;knock-out;metabolic engineering;metabolic process, cellular;metabolite;photosynthesis;phytophthora inflata;simulation;synechocystis;cell growth;hydrogen biosynthetic process;succinate	Arnau Montagud;Emilio Navarro;Pedro Fernández de Córdoba;Javier F.

A deletion of approximately 5 kb was observed which was probably caused by an unequal crossing-over between the -G gamma- and -A gamma- genes resulting in the formation of a -G gamma A gamma- hybrid gene. Data on proportions of G gamma and A gamma chains in newborn babies assumed to be heterozygous for the hybrid and normal genes suggest that this hybrid gene may be producing its A gamma chain at levels normally seen only for the G gamma chain.

e2acb41a096a520c10776f27e2f803e3ba72caec	development of a polymer-theoretic approach to describing constraints on reactions between antipeptide antibodies and intrinsically disordered peptide antigens: implications for b-cell epitope prediction		B-cell epitope prediction aims to support translational applications as exemplified by peptide-based vaccine design. This entails selection of immunizing peptide sequences that tend to be intrinsically disordered and thus appropriately described within the framework of polymer theory. A fully extended hexapeptide sequence spans a typical antibody footprint; but disordered peptides are flexible rather than rigid, such that their B-cell epitopes may vary in length according to the diversity of conformations assumed upon binding by antibodies. Hence, peptides were modeled herein as worm-like chains, using an interpolated approximation of the radial probability density distribution function to estimate the probability that the ends of a peptidic sequence are separated by a distance less than or equal to a typical antibody footprint diameter. The results suggest that the epitopes are likely to be no more than 17 residues long, which is consistent with available structural data on immune complexes consisting of antipeptide antibodies bound to cognate peptide antigens. For such antigens, B-cell epitope prediction thus could proceed with initial scanning for intrinsically disordered sequences of length up to a physicochemically plausible maximum value (e.g., 17 residues), with analysis of progressively longer subsequences to identify nonredundant sets of putative epitopes (e.g., based on predicted affinity).	approximation;cell (microprocessor);interpolation;norm (social);polymer;processor affinity;radial (radio)	Salvador Eugenio C.

Conventional string-based methods have not been successful because many types of regulatory regions do not have recognizable motifs. And even when a sequence pattern is known to be associated with a class of regulatory regions it commonly is necessary, but not sufficient, for function. This suggests that other attributes, not necessarily strongly correlated with the details of base sequence, are involved in regulation. Here we present a computational method to analyze the propensity of superhelically stressed DNA to undergo strand separation events, as is required for the initiation of both transcription and replication. We build in silico models to analyze the statistical mechanical equilibrium distribution of a population of identical, stressed DNA molecules among its states of strand separation. In this phenomenon, which we call stress induced duplex destabilization (SIDD), a state energy is determined by the energy cost of opening the specific separated base pairs in that state, and the energy relief from the relaxation of stress this affords. We use experimentally measured values of all energy parameters, including the nearest neighbor energetics known to govern DNA base pair stability. We perform a statistical mechanical analysis in which the approximate equilibrium distribution is calculated from all states whose free energies do not exceed a user-defined threshold. This provides the most general and efficient computational approach to the analysis of this phenomenon. The algorithm is implemented in C++, and its performance is analyzed.	approximation algorithm;c++;computation;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;induced subgraph;linear programming relaxation;markov chain;sequence motif;strand (programming language);strongly correlated material;transcription (software)	Chengpeng Bi;Craig J.

The binding site sequences for any TF can be experimentally determined and represented in a position weight matrix (PWM). PWMs can then be used to predict the location of TF binding sites in other regions of the genome, although there are limitations to this approach as currently implemented. In this proof-of-principle study, we analyze 127 CRMs and focus on four TFs that control transcription of target genes along the anterio-posterior axis of the embryo early in development. For all four of these TFs, there is some degree of conserved flanking sequence that extends beyond the predicted binding regions. A potential role for these conserved flanking sequences may be to enhance the specificity of TF binding, as the abundance of these sequences is greatly diminished when we examine only predicted high-affinity binding sites. Expanding PWMs to include sequence context-dependence will increase the information content in PWMs and facilitate a more efficient functional identification and dissection of CRMs.	apache axis;axis vertebra;binding sites;context-sensitive language;dna binding site;experiment;f factor;flank (surface region);gene expression;gene regulatory network;interaction;position weight matrix;processor affinity;pulse-width modulation;regulatory sequences, ribonucleic acid;self-information;sensitivity and specificity;transcription factor;transcription (software)	Jessica L.

We aimed to identify an amino acid pattern shared by disease-relevant peptides associated with newly reported and already known cutaneous amyloidoses.   METHOD We probed proteins of cutaneous and non-cutaneous amyloidoses for the amyloid motif identified previously (""""D/E/N/Q, A/G, D/E/N/Q, 4-20X, V/I/L/M, D/E/N/Q, R/K/H, 0-6X, V/I/L/M, 0-5X, F/Y/W, 4-5X, D/E/N/Q, 0-2X, R/K/H, 0-12X, A/G, V/I/L/M, 0-3X, V/I/L/M, 0-2X, A/G""""). Once segments containing the motif were found, these were subject to multiple alignment to detect similarities and dissimilarities between them.   RESULTS The amyloid motif was present, totally or partially, in all proteins; in turn, it was contained, completely or incompletely, in segments of such proteins known to be deposited in the corresponding amyloidoses. The aligned segments of the cutaneous amiloidoses were more similar to each other than to those of the noncutaneous amyloidoses.   CONCLUSIONS The motif-based approach can contribute to the multidisciplinary solution of the complex problem of the pathogenesis of amyloidosis, and could help to identify possible new amyloid forming proteins."""	amino acid sequence;amino acids;amyloid neuropathies, familial;amyloidosis;contain (action);cutaneous candidiasis;denominator;fibril - cell component;lymphoma, t-cell, cutaneous;motif;multiple sequence alignment;pathogenesis	Fabrizio Guarneri;Serafinella Patrizia Cannavò;Salvatore Benvenga	2014	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2014.04.005	pathology;computer science;bioinformatics	Comp.	4.721952943201168	-63.518177974293465	150844

They may be used as leads in the development of novel therapeutic agents provided the pharmacophoric information present within them can be translated into non-peptide analogs that lack the peptide backbone and are stable to proteolysis. This is the rationale for peptidomimetic drug design. Frequently, the beta-turn has been implicated as a conformation important for biological recognition of peptides. Empirical evidence from known peptidomimetics, coupled with a theoretical model of peptide binding and the observation that glycine and proline residues are common within the beta-turn, has suggested the design of molecules to mimic placement of between two and four of the side-chains. The moderate number of different beta-turn conformations, combined with the combinatoric nature of side-chain selection complicates the procedure. In this paper, cluster analysis has been used to classify the arrangement of C alpha atoms about the various fragments of the beta-turn. Recombination of the observed patterns provides a general model for the beta-turn which may be used as an effective screen for potential peptidomimetic scaffolds in chemical databases.	analog;atom;chemical database;cluster analysis;design rationale;drug design;glycine;internet backbone;proline;theory;vertebral column	S.

The exact nature of these interactions, which determine the lineage patterning of the trophectoderm and endoderm tissues occurring in a highly regulated manner at precise periods during the embryonic development, is an area of debate. We have developed a computational modeling framework for studying this process, by which the combined effects of mechanical and genetic interactions are analyzed within the context of proliferating cells. At a purely mechanical level, we demonstrate that the perpendicular alignment of the animal-vegetal (a-v) and embryonic-abembryonic (eb-ab) axes is a result of minimizing the total elastic conformational energy of the entire collection of cells, which are constrained by the zona pellucida. The coupling of gene expression with the mechanics of cell movement is important for formation of both the trophectoderm and the endoderm. In studying the formation of the trophectoderm, we contrast and compare quantitatively two hypotheses: (1) The position determines gene expression, and (2) the gene expression determines the position. Our model, which couples gene expression with mechanics, suggests that differential adhesion between different cell types is a critical determinant in the robust endoderm formation. In addition to differential adhesion, two different testable hypotheses emerge when considering endoderm formation: (1) A directional force acts on certain cells and moves them into forming the endoderm layer, which separates the blastocoel and the cells of the inner cell mass (ICM). In this case the blastocoel simply acts as a static boundary. (2) The blastocoel dynamically applies pressure upon the cells in contact with it, such that cell segregation in the presence of differential adhesion leads to the endoderm formation. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine cell-based spatial mechanical simulations with genetic networks to explain mammalian embryogenesis. Such a framework provides the means to test hypotheses in a controlled in silico environment.	blastocyst structure;body tissue;cell separation;computation;computational model;embryo;embryonic development;emoticon;gene expression;gene regulatory network;inner cell mass;interaction;iterated conditional modes;lineage (evolution);mammals;mechanics;simulation;zona pellucida;endoderm formation	Pawel Krupinski;Vijay Chickarmane;Carsten Peterson	2011		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001128	computer simulation;biology;embryo;embryogenesis;gene expression;inner cell mass;germ layer;genetics;cell adhesion;cell division;anatomy	Comp.	8.22805235815917	-64.72890528206901	151243

These enzymes exist in the context of networks defined by the static topology of enzyme-metabolite interactions and by the reaction fluxes that are feasible at steady state. We use the local topology and the flux correlations to identify how failures in the metabolic network may lead to disease. First, using yeast as a model, we show that flux correlations are a powerful predictor of pairwise mutations that lead to cell death -- more powerful, in fact, than computational models that directly estimate the effects of mutations on cell fitness. These flux correlations, which can exist between enzymes far-separated in the metabolic network, add information to the structural correlations evident from shared metabolites. Second, we show that flux correlations in human align with similarities in Mendelian phenotypes ascribed to known genes. These methods will be useful in predicting genetic interactions in model organisms and understanding the combinatorial effects of genetic variations in humans.		Balaji Veeramani;Joel S.

Identifying the targets of this heterodimeric basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor poses challenges and it has been difficult to decipher its specific sequence affinity beyond a canonical E-box motif, except perhaps for some flanking bases contributing weakly to the binding energy. Thus, no good computational model presently exists for predicting CLK/CYC, CLOCK/BMAL1, or NPAS2/BMAL1 targets. Here, we use a comparative genomics approach and first study the conservation properties of the best-known circadian enhancer: a 69-bp element upstream of the Drosophila melanogaster period gene. This fragment shows a signal involving the presence of two closely spaced E-box-like motifs, a configuration that we can also detect in the other four prominent CLK/CYC target genes in flies: timeless, vrille, Pdp1, and cwo. This allows for the training of a probabilistic sequence model that we test using functional genomics datasets. We find that the predicted sequences are overrepresented in promoters of genes induced in a recent study by a glucocorticoid receptor-CLK fusion protein. We then scanned the mouse genome with the fly model and found that many known CLOCK/BMAL1 targets harbor sequences matching our consensus. Moreover, the phase of predicted cyclers in liver agreed with known CLOCK/BMAL1 regulation. Taken together, we built a predictive model for CLK/CYC or CLOCK/BMAL1-bound cis-enhancers through the integration of comparative and functional genomics data.

We studied the remodeling of collagen matrices by individual vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), clusters and monolayers. In addition, we focused on the contribution of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which plays an important role in the remodeling of small arteries. Single SMCs displaced fibers in collagen matrices at distances up to at least 300 μm in the course of 8–12 h. This process involved both ‘hauling up’ of matrix by the cells and local matrix compaction at a distance from the cells, up to 200 μm. This exceeded the distance over which cellular protrusions were active, implicating the involvement of secreted enzymes such as TG2. SMC isolated from TG2 KO mice still showed compaction, with changed dynamics and relaxation. The TG active site inhibitor L682777 blocked local compaction by wild type cells, strongly reducing the displacement of matrix towards the cells. At increasing cell density, cells cooperated to establish compaction. In a ring-shaped collagen matrix, this resulted in preferential displacement in the radial direction, perpendicular to the cellular long axis. This process was unaffected by inhibition of TG2 cross-linking. These results show that SMCs are capable of matrix remodeling by prolonged, gradual compaction along their short axis. This process could add to the 3D organization and remodeling of blood vessels based on the orientation and contraction of SMCs.	apache axis;arterial system;axis vertebra;blood vessel;cell surface extensions;cell secretion;data compaction;displacement mapping;distance;kidney diseases;linear programming relaxation;muscle cells;muscle, smooth, vascular;myocytes, smooth muscle;optic axis of a crystal;psychologic displacement;radial (radio);smooth muscle (tissue);tgm2 gene;tissue fiber;transglutaminases;wild type;physiological aspects;subrhabdomeral cisterna	Jeroen van den Akker;Bilge Guvenc Tuna;Adrian Pistea;Arie J.

c06aff4375046262cbee6d547070b3a0ed76642d	introduction to computational proteomics	proteins;proteomics;computational biology;gene expression profiling;sequence analysis protein;peptide mapping	P roteomics is defined as the protein complement of the genome and involves the complete analysis of all the proteins in a given sample [1,2]. Several technologies are involved, and numerous questions concerning the proteins are addressed. What proteins are contained in a biological sample? At what concentration do the proteins exist? How do protein expression levels alter in different samples? What are the posttranslational modifications (PTMs)? Where in the cell [3] or an organism [4] are the proteins localised? How do the proteins interact with other proteins or molecules [5,6]? The following discussion concentrates on computational aspects of protein identification. Characterization (identification of protein modifications), quantitation, and sample comparisons are also discussed briefly. A typical proteomic experiment involves the analysis of complex samples, i.e., containing many proteins at varying concentrations [7]. Most of the currently available technology for identifying proteins from biological samples simply cannot contend with the complexity, and the majority of the low-abundance proteins are not observed. There are, however, a number of methods to separate the proteins contained in the original sample to obtain a simpler sample set that is amenable to in-depth analyses. Typical technologies are electrophoretic gels [8] and liquid chromatography [9] (LC) (see Figure 1A). A dominant and well-practiced technique in proteomics is referred to as the ‘‘bottom-up’’ approach. Proteins are digested into peptides (smaller components of the protein) by a proteolytic enzyme, e.g., trypsin. Analysis of the peptides is achieved by mass spectrometry (MS), and, from the data generated, the peptides (and subsequently the proteins) can be identified. The resultant mixture of peptides obtained from the digestion of several proteins is often highly complex, and a degree of separation can be achieved by peptide LC. Possible combinations of separation techniques are illustrated in Figure 1B. Mass spectrometers comprise three main components: an ion-source, a fragmentation cell, and a mass analyzer. Each component is essentially independent from the others, and as such it is possible to combine the different technological aspects to produce different types of mass spectrometers. To measure its molecular mass, a molecule must be ionised. This occurs in the ion source of the mass spectrometer. The source can be based either on electrospray ionization [10] (ESI), which is therefore appropriate for liquid samples; or on matrix assisted laser desorption ionization [11] (MALDI), which is appropriate for samples that have been mixed with a matrix and crystallized on a metallic plate. The most common types of mass analyzers used in proteomic laboratories are (i) ion trap (IT), where the radio frequency of the trap is varied and the ejected ions are detected; and (ii) time-of-flight (TOF) analyzers, where the time required for an ion to ‘‘fly’’ through an electric field–free region of the instrument is recorded and correlated to the mass of the ion. Most current instruments include a fragmentation cell that uses an inert gas to break the peptides by collision-induced dissociation (CID). A fragmentation cell, however, is not always present (see next section), or fragmentation can occur ‘‘spontaneously’’ (in-source and post-source decay). All mass spectrometers do not measure mass directly, but rather the mass-to-charge ratio. Hence the measurements obtained are dependent on the charge state(s) of the molecule.

The aim of this system is twofold: first, to demonstrate the survival of extracellular replicators despite the presence of faster-replicating parasites; second, to observe the evolution of adaptively useful enzymes. Accomplishing these goals will underpin future attempts to attain open-ended and/or creative evolution in the Squirm3 environment. The first aim is achieved by attaching enzymes to their replicators. Our software implementation demonstrates replicators with 10 bases prospering in the presence of parasites with zero bases. To accomplish the second aim, a process for creating selection pressure toward longer molecules is introduced. The evolution and subsequent dominance of a replicator that produces an adaptively useful enzyme is demonstrated experimentally. Finally, we comment on the crucial role played by neutral evolution and discuss the biological significance of our results.	arabic numeral 0;artificial chemistry;artificial life;base;biological evolution;complexity;eighty;emergence;environment, controlled;evolution strategy;experiment;francisco varela;fruit;genetic selection;inspiration function;java programming language;labor (childbirth);nonlinear gameplay;parasites;phenotype;replicator (stargate);self-replication;source code;tierra (computer simulation);tissue membrane	Michael W.

Under single locus complementary sex-determination (sl-CSD) system, the sex of a specimen depends on the alleles at a single locus: when diploid, an individual will be a female if heterozygous and male if homozygous. Significant diploid male (DM) production may drive a population to an extinction scenario called “diploid male vortex”. We aimed at studying the dynamics of populations of a sl-CSD organism under several combinations of two parameters: male flight abilities and number of sexual alleles. In these simulations, we evaluated the frequency of DM and a genetic diversity measure over 10,000 generations. The number of sexual alleles varied from 10 to 100 and, at each generation, a male offspring might fly to another random site within a varying radius R. Two main results emerge from our simulations: (i) the number of DM depends more on male flight radius than on the number of alleles; (ii) in large geographic regions, the effect of males flight radius on the allelic diversity turns out much less pronounced than in small regions. In other words, small regions where inbreeding normally appears recover genetic diversity due to large flight radii. These results may be particularly relevant when considering the population dynamics of species with increasingly limited dispersal ability (e.g., forest-dependent species of euglossine bees in fragmented landscapes)	alleles;ants;bees;biological specimen;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;cambridge structural database;diploidy;genital diseases, male;hereditary diseases;homozygote;hymenoptera;inbreeding;insecta;locus;ovum;physiological sexual disorders;population dynamics;simulation;variation (genetics);vortex;wasps	Luiz R.

The model combines gene expression data and prior biological knowledge regarding the potential for regulatory interactions between genes and their corresponding transcription factors. The formalism provides significant advantages over available modeling methodologies in that the complexity of the regulatory network can be explicitly taken into account, multiple alternative structures can be systematically generated and finally robust and biological significant regulators can be rigorously identified. The original non-convex mixed integer reformulation is appropriately linearized and the resulting MILP is effectively optimized using standard solvers. The versatility is demonstrated using gene expression and binding data from an E. coli case study during transition from glucose to acetate as the sole carbon source.	gene expression profiling;gene regulatory network;high-throughput computing;ibm notes;interaction;mathematical optimization;name binding;network architecture;norm (social);semantics (computer science);throughput;transcription (software);while	Panagiota T.

bd3a9a464ef27d9204f30330ad1baaa493be6214	studies of mutation accumulation in three codon positions using monte carlo simulations and metropolis-hastings algorithm		Protein coding sequences are characterized by specific nucleotide composition in three codon positions as a result of mutational and selection pressures. To analyse the impact of mutations and different transition/transversion ratio on three codon position in protein coding sequences, we elaborated a model of genome evolution based Monte Carlo simulation. Selection was applied against stop translation codons and modified Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to maintain typical nucleotide composition of particular codon positions. The simulations were performed on genomes consisting of bacterial gene sequences. We used a series of nucleotide substitution matrices assuming different transition/transversion ratio and nucleotide stationary distribution characteristic of the real mutational pressure. The simulations showed exponential decrease in the number of eliminated genomes with the growth of the transition/transversion ratio. The same trend was also observed both for accepted and to lesser extent for rejected mutations. The third codon positions much more mutations accepted than rejected because of very similar composition to the mutational stationary distribution, whereas the first positions accumulated the smallest number of mutations and rejected the most as a result of strong selection on its nucleotide composition. The obtained results showed different response of three codon positions on mutational pressure related with their characteristic nucleotide composition.	computer simulation;international conference on bioinformatics;machine translation;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm;mike lesser;monte carlo method;offset binary;stationary process;time complexity;tree accumulation	Malgorzata Grabinska;Pawel Blazej;Pawel Mackiewicz	2014		10.5220/0004911502450252	computer science;nucleotide;gene;genome evolution;genome;genetics;monte carlo method;codon usage bias;transversion;mutation	Comp.	3.3253927480241185	-62.64065013109328	155065

Its role in mediating infectious disease has led to the elucidation of numerous autoinducers and their corresponding QS signaling pathways. Among them, the Lsr (LuxS-regulated) QS system is conserved in scores of bacteria, and its signal molecule, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), is synthesized as a product of 1-carbon metabolism. Lsr signal transduction processes, therefore, may help organize population scale activities in numerous bacterial consortia. Conceptions of how Lsr QS organizes population scale behaviors remain limited, however. Using mathematical simulations, we examined how desynchronized Lsr QS activation, arising from cell-to-cell population heterogeneity, could lead to bimodal Lsr signaling and fractional activation. This has been previously observed experimentally. Governing these processes are an asynchronous AI-2 uptake, where positive intracellular feedback in Lsr expression is combined with negative feedback between cells. The resulting activation patterns differ from that of the more widely studied LuxIR system, the topology of which consists of only positive feedback. To elucidate differences, both QS systems were simulated in 2D, where cell populations grow and signal each other via traditional growth and diffusion equations. Our results demonstrate that the LuxIR QS system produces an 'outward wave' of autoinduction, and the Lsr QS system yields dispersed autoinduction from spatially-localized secretion and uptake profiles. In both cases, our simulations mirror previously demonstrated experimental results. As a whole, these models inform QS observations and synthetic biology designs.	anatomy, regional;behavior;cell signaling;communicable diseases;computer simulation;conception;experiment;intrinsic drive;loose source routing;mathematics;negative feedback;population;positive feedback;quorum sensing;signal transduction;synthetic biology;synthetic intelligence;transduction (machine learning);ribosylhomocysteinase activity	David N.

We observed that: (I) the probability of one given palindromic sequence P(i) with the given palindromic sequence i follows a power-law distribution when the length of the palindromic sequences is between five and fifteen bases, and in this case, the total number N(n) of palindromic sequences which occur n times with the occurrences n follows a power-law distribution too; (II) the repeated palindromic sequences are found nearly at the same site in the different tRNA sequences as their length is longer than five bases; In addition, the longer palindromic sequences are always discovered in the center or both sides of some stem-loops of tRNA sequences; (III) the palindromic sequences of absolute AT/GC content almost decrease with the increase of the length of palindromic sequences K, and the palindromic sequences of absolute AT content are always more than the GC content for a same K value. By the analysis of the palindromic sequences among all the tRNA sequences, the structure and evolution process of tRNA sequences are also discussed in this paper.			2011		10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022272	biology;molecular biology;bioinformatics;genetics	Theory	4.251935220845846	-62.93948243182359	155909

The recombination processes may happen in a succession, possibly with some recombination events performed simultaneously, but others in a prescribed order. These events are modeled by three rewriting rules applied on a set of formal linear and circular words.We define a partial order on these sets in such away that two sets are related by this order whenmolecules represented by one are produced by recombination events from the other. We apply our model to experimental data obtained for DNA rearrangement of the actin I gene in O. trifallax ciliates, and we predict possible pathways of gene rearrangement compatible with the data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

During reproduction, all blocks are assembled in the correct order and orientation. This process is possible due to the special structure of micronuclear genes: each coding block M ends with a short nucleotide sequence (called pointer) that is repeated at the beginning of the coding block that should follow M in the assembled gene. Many of the pointers have multiple occurrences along both strands of the gene. This yields a very high number of pointer-induced possible divisions into coding and noncoding blocks. We investigate the distribution of pointers for all currently sequenced micronuclear ciliate genes with the goal of identifying what distinguishes the real gene structure among all possible coding/noncoding divisions. We find a sharp criterion in the average a/t-content of the noncoding blocks: the real division has, in most cases, the maximum such content among all possible combinations. Even for pointers as short as two nucleotides, the real division is one of very few with an average a/t-content of its noncoding blocks over 80%. The separation is most clear when the loci of pointers of up to four nucleotides (even three in the case of unscrambled genes) are fixed (e.g., through a template-based recombination mechanism).	base sequence;clinical use template;eighty;gene feature;nucleotides;pointer (computer programming);pointer <dog>;speech synthesis	Sergey Verlan;Artiom Alhazov;Ion Petre	2010	Bio Systems	10.1016/j.biosystems.2010.05.003	biology;nucleotide;pointer;nucleic acid sequence;bioinformatics;sequence analysis;gene;genetics;algorithm	Theory	3.762322383983343	-63.33394745018572	157177

Earlier studies showed that the EGFR is frequently overexpressed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR mutations at specific amino acid residues in the kinase domain induce altered responsiveness to gefitinib, a small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, the mechanism underlying the drug response modulated by EGFR mutation is still largely unknown. To elucidate drug response in EGFR signal transduction pathway in which complex dynamics of multiple molecules involved, a systematic approach is necessary. In this paper, we performed experimental and computational analyses to clarify the underlying mechanism of EGFR signaling and cell-specific gefitinib responsiveness in three H1299-derived NSCLC cell lines; H1299 wild type (H1299WT), H1299 with an overexpressed wild type EGFR (H1299EGFR-WT), and H1299 with an overexpressed mutant EGFR L858R (H1299L858R; gefitinib sensitive mutant). We predicted and experimentally verified that Mig6, which is a known negative regulator of EGFR and specifically expressed in H1299L858R cells, synergized with gefitinib to suppress cellular growth. Computational analyses indicated that this inhibitory effect is amplified at the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation steps of MEK and ERK. Thus, we showed that L858R receptor mutation in combination with expression of its negative regulator, Mig6, alters signaling outcomes and results in variable drug sensitivity.	amino acids;carcinoma of lung;cell proliferation;complex dynamics;computation;egfr np_005219.2:p.l858r;errfi1 wt allele;epidermal growth factor receptor;experiment;gene regulatory network;glossary of cryptographic keys;growth factor receptors;mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases;modulation;mutation;neoplasms;non-small cell lung carcinoma;protein tyrosine kinase;protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor;responsiveness;signal transduction pathways;small molecule;transduction (machine learning);wild type;cell growth;drug response;gefitinib	Yoshimi Naruo;Takeshi Nagashima;Ryoko Ushikoshi-Nakayama;Yuko Saeki;Takashi Nakakuki;Takashi Naka;Hiroshi Tanaka;Shih-Feng Tsai;Mariko Okada	2010		10.1186/1752-0509-5-29	cancer research;biology;molecular biology;bioinformatics;cyclin-dependent kinase 8;genetics;systems biology;signal transduction	Comp.	7.022959907396508	-63.21505337137066	157207

Mutagenesis studies and docking of these ligands in a rhodopsin-based homology model revealed two essential points of interactions in the binding pocket, i.e. Asp3.32 and Glu5.46 (Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering system). It is postulated that Asp3.32 interacts in its anionic state, whereas Glu5.46 interacts in its neutral form. The hypothesis was tested with the point mutations D3.32N and E5.46Q. For the D3.32N no binding affinity toward any of the ligands could be detected. This is in sharp contrast to the E5.46Q mutant, which discriminates between various ligands. The affinity of histamine-like ligands was decreased approximately a 1000-fold, whereas the affinity of all other ligands remained virtually unchanged. The proposed model for agonist binding as well as ab initio calculations for histamine and VUF 8430 explain the observed differences in binding to the H 4R mutants. These studies provide a molecular understanding for the action of a variety of H 4 receptor-ligands. The resulting H 4 receptor model will be the basis for the development of new H 4 receptor-ligands.	clozapine;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;histamine;homologous gene;homology (biology);homology modeling;ligands;point mutation;processor affinity;teenage mutant ninja turtles;vuf 8430;receptor	Aldo Jongejan;Herman D.

87495aac2ed48f30d4ba97f2e6f9b33947c56653	network motifs, feedback loops and the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks		We analyse a suite of Boolean networks which have been evolved to exhibit limit cycle-type dynamics in terms of the distribution of small network motifs and feedback loops. We find that asynchronously updated Boolean networks can be evolved to exhibit fuzzy limit cycle dynamics without significant changes to the number of nodes and links in the network. Analysis of all possible triads of nodes in the networks and all feedback loops of length one to eight reveal no significant differences between the evolved and unevolved networks. We conclude that the reductionist, motif-based approach to network analysis may be inadequate to full understanding of network dynamics, and that some dynamic behaviour is an emergent property of complex networks as a whole.	boolean network;complex network;emergence;feedback;limit cycle;motif;reductionism;social network analysis	Jennifer Hallinan;Paul T.

e401ec0acb7bb8f4c889e202eb5861548b856bf0	effective neutralization and neutralization epitope masking signatures for four anti-v3 mabs	activity analysis;glycoprotein;monoclonal antibody;comparative modeling;docking;neutralization potential;sequence motif;il1β	"""Effective antibody-mediated HIV-1 neutralization may be significantly diminished by factors such as epitope masking. Epitopes on HIV's surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120) may be masked either intrinsically, by glycans, or by occlusion by other protein regions. Previously, we quantitatively assessed neutralization epitope masking on a panel of HIV-1 pseudoviruses (psVs), with or without specific mAb epitopes, based on IC50 neutralization data and monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitope sequence motifs obtained from Hioe et al. (2010) and Cardozo et al. (2009), respectively.  Here, we conducted a similar study using data from a novel and statistical neutralization analysis method: area under the neutralization titration curves (AUC), data from Hioe et al. (2010). Using the panel of HIV-1 pseudoviruses with and without specific mAb epitopes from our previous study, we were able to determine the epitope masking signatures for four mAbs: 2219, 3074, 447-52D and 2557 based on this AUC neutralization data. We also estimated the effective neutralization potential (EN) for each mAb. The effective neutralization score was calculated as: EN = (global conservation percentage) x [(100%-masked percentage)/100]  where """"global conservation percentage"""" is the percentage of circulating viruses containing the mAb targeted epitope, as taken from Swetnam et al. (2010); and """"masked percentage"""" is the percentage of viruses containing a mAb-targeted epitope that were not neutralized.  As in our previous study, we found the epitope targeted by mAb 2219 is the least masked overall, with the highest EN. Although interestingly, the neutralization epitope masking signature for each of the four mAbs was different when plotted from the AUC-based neutralization data versus from the IC50 values.  Not only do different mAbs targeted to the same region of gp120 have different patterns of epitope masking in addition to a different distribution of their epitopes across circulating HIV-1 viruses, but different methods of neutralization activity analysis can also provide a different picture of effective neutralization and epitope masking."""	antibody microarray;antivirus software;sequence motif;unsharp masking	Alpna Agarwal;Susan Zolla-Pazner;James Swetnam;Timothy Cardozo	2010		10.1145/1854776.1854903	docking;biology;homology modeling;bioinformatics;virology;glycoprotein;immunology;monoclonal antibody;sequence motif	NLP	8.609635218052695	-61.146926494877555	157900

However, our understanding of their molecular control is incomplete. In this study we have confirmed that the ring finger 14 protein (RNF14), a poorly understood transcriptional regulator, influences the expression of both mitochondrial and immune-related genes. The prediction was based on a combination of network connectivity and differential connectivity in cattle (a non-model organism) and mice data sets, with a focus on skeletal muscle. They assigned similar probability to mammalian RNF14 playing a regulatory role in mitochondrial and immune gene expression. To try and resolve this apparent ambiguity we performed a genome-wide microarray expression analysis on mouse C2C12 myoblasts transiently transfected with two Rnf14 transcript variants that encode 2 naturally occurring but different RNF14 protein isoforms. The effect of both constructs was significantly different to the control samples (untransfected cells and cells transfected with an empty vector). Cluster analyses revealed that transfection with the two Rnf14 constructs yielded discrete expression signatures from each other, but in both cases a substantial set of genes annotated as encoding proteins related to immune function were perturbed. These included cytokines and interferon regulatory factors. Additionally, transfection of the longer transcript variant 1 coordinately increased the expression of 12 (of the total 13) mitochondrial proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome, 3 of which were significant in isolated pair-wise comparisons (Mt-coxII, Mt-nd2 and mt-nd4l). This apparent additional mitochondrial function may be attributable to the RWD protein domain that is present only in the longer RNF14 isoform. RNF14 influences the expression of both mitochondrial and immune related genes in a skeletal muscle context, and has likely implications for the inter-relationship between bioenergetic status and inflammation.	antivirus software;bioenergetics;encode (action);fourth finger;gene expression;genome, mitochondrial;immune system processes;interferon type ii;mammals;microarray;mitochondrial inheritance;mitochondrial proteins;muscle development;myoblasts;personnameuse - assigned;protein domain;protein isoforms;responsive web design;skeletal muscle structure;status epilepticus;transcript;transcription, genetic;voltage regulator;health and disease;physiological aspects	Aaron Ingham;Simone A.

5273c27f4dbb6f833e5cb7c729efd9396ac48ae0	concerted movement in ph-dependent gating of foca from molecular dynamics simulations		FocA, a member of the formate-nitrite transporter (FNT) family, transports formate and nitrite across biological membranes in cellular organisms. The export and uptake of formate in bacteria are both mediated by FocA, which undergoes a pH-dependent functional switch. Recently, the crystal structures of Escherichia coli FocA (EcFocA), Vibrio cholerae FocA (VcFocA), and Salmonella typhimurium FocA (StFocA) were reported. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) on StFocA and EcFocA with different states of His209 (protonated and unprotonated), representing different pH conditions of FocA. The N-terminal helix in each protomer of StFocA covers and blocks the formate channel. At neutral or high pH (MD simulations with unprotonated His209), the concerted movement of the N-terminal helices of pairs of protomers of StFocA opens its formate channel. At low pH (MD simulations with protonated His209), protonated His209 interacts tightly with its neighboring residue Asn262, and the channel becomes narrower, so that the formate can hardly pass through the channel. We obtained similar results for EcFocA. Our study shows that pairs of protomers of FocA move in a concerted way to achieve its pH-dependent gating function, which provides information on the dynamics of the gating mechanism of FNT proteins and aquaporins.	computer simulation;crystal structure;formates;mobility aid;molecular dynamics;protomers;solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1b1;transporter classification database;two-hybrid screening;vibrio cholerae;formate;newton;nitrite ion;water channel	Zhiwei Feng;Tingjun Hou;Youyong Li	2012	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci300250q	crystallography;biochemistry;chemistry	HPC	8.194488126579841	-63.21829342777836	158665

The paper introduces the integration of cluster-oriented genetic algorithms (COGAs) with such machine-based library design environments. COGAs have a proven capability to identify high-performance regions of complex, continuous design spaces relating to engineering design problems. Modifications to the basic COCA approach are described that allow a transfer of this capability from continuous variable parameter space to the highly discrete spaces described by reactants across reagent libraries. Results relating firstly to the identification of optimal molecules and secondly to the focussing of reagent libraries in terms of high-performance reactants are presented.

Human mitochondrial proteins determined by experimental and computational methods have been superposed on the reference pathways from the KEGG database to identify mitochondrial pathways. Enzymes at the entry and exit points for each reconstructed pathway were identified, and mitochondrial solute carrier proteins were determined where applicable. Intermediate enzymes in the mitochondrial pathways were identified based on the annotations available from public databases, evidence in current literature, or our MITOPRED program, which predicts the mitochondrial localization of proteins. Through integration of the data derived from experimental, bibliographical, and computational sources, we reconstructed the amino acid metabolic pathways in human mitochondria, which could help better understand the mitochondrial metabolism and its role in human health.	amino acid [epc];amino acids;bioinformatics;computation;database;entry point;gene regulatory network;kegg;mitochondria;mitochondrial diseases;quantum superposition;solute carrier proteins;amino acid metabolism;mitochondrion localization	Purnima Guda;Chittibabu Guda;Shankar Subramaniam	2007		10.1016/S1672-0229(08)60004-2	biology;biochemistry;metabolic pathway;cell biology;bioinformatics	Comp.	5.860553092049088	-60.35313856111568	160387

The conservation of genomes over intervals at the geological timescale and the existence of mutations at shorter intervals can be conciliated assuming that genomes possess intrinsic error-correction codes. The better conservation of old parts of genomes leads to assume that these codes are organized as a nested system set up during geological times, which protects a genomic message the better, the older it is. These hypotheses imply that: genomes are redundant, discrete species exist with a hierarchical taxonomy, successive generations are needed, evolution is contingent and saltationist; it trends towards increasing complexity. These consequences match features of the actual living world but their experimental confirmation needs a still lacking collaboration of biologists and information-theorists. It is suggested that genomic error-correcting codes could consist of ¿soft codes¿ where mutual dependence of symbols results from physical-chemical and linguistic constraints, not only mathematical equalities. The constraints incurred by DNA molecules moreover result in a nested structure.

While the complete set of regulatory and functional pathways supporting growth and cellular proliferation are not yet known, portions of them are well understood. In particular, cellular proliferation is governed by mechanisms that are highly conserved from unicellular to multicellular organisms, and the disruption of these processes in metazoans is a major factor in the development of cancer. In this paper, we develop statistical methodology to identify quantitative aspects of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular proliferation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that the expression levels of a small set of genes can be exploited to predict the instantaneous growth rate of any cellular culture with high accuracy. The predictions obtained in this fashion are robust to changing biological conditions, experimental methods, and technological platforms. The proposed model is also effective in predicting growth rates for the related yeast Saccharomyces bayanus and the highly diverged yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that the underlying regulatory signature is conserved across a wide range of unicellular evolution. We investigate the biological significance of the gene expression signature that the predictions are based upon from multiple perspectives: by perturbing the regulatory network through the Ras/PKA pathway, observing strong upregulation of growth rate even in the absence of appropriate nutrients, and discovering putative transcription factor binding sites, observing enrichment in growth-correlated genes. More broadly, the proposed methodology enables biological insights about growth at an instantaneous time scale, inaccessible by direct experimental methods.

In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to unravel changes in the MERS CoV heptad repeat domains (HRs) and factors affecting fusion state HR stability. Results indicated that HR trimer is more rapidly stabilized, having stable system energy and lower root mean square deviations (RMSDs). While trimers were the predominant active form of CoVs HRs, monomers were also discovered in both of viral and cellular membranes. In order to find the differences between S2 monomer and trimer molecular dynamics, S2 monomer was modelled and subjected to MD simulation. In contrast to S2 trimer, S2 monomer was unstable, having high RMSDs with major drifts above 8 Å. Fluctuation of HR residue positions revealed major changes in the C-terminal of HR2 and the linker coil between HR1 and HR2 in both monomer and trimer. Hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions of HR helices stabilize the whole system, with minimal changes in RMSD. The global distance test and contact area difference scores support instability of MERS CoV S2 monomer. Analysis of HR1-HR2 inter-residue contacts and interaction energy revealed three energy scales along HR helices. Two strong interaction energies were identified at the start of the HR2 helix and at the C-terminal of HR2. The identified critical residues by MD simulation and residues at the a and d positions of HR helix were strong stabilizers of HR recognition.	coil gene;city of heroes;control theory;dvb-s2;efimov state;energy, physics;genus: coronavirus;global distance test;half rate;instability;interaction energy;mean squared error;methods of computing square roots;middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus;molecular dynamics;plant roots;quantum fluctuation;simulation;tissue membrane;unstable medical device problem;heart rate;monomer;procollagen type i n-terminal peptide	Mahmoud Kandeel;Abdullah Altaher;Huifang Li;Udo Schwingenschlögl;Mohamed Alnazawi	2018	Computational biology and chemistry	10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2018.05.020	trimer;molecular dynamics;crystallography;genetics;heptad repeat;helix;coronavirus;monomer;middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus;interaction energy;biology	Comp.	9.026525692259384	-63.45893164554215	161549

Despite its importance in molecular evolutionary studies, identifying the sequences that exhibit such patterns has received comparatively less attention in the recombination detection framework. Here, we extend a quartet-mapping based recombination detection method to enable identification of recombinant sequences without prior specifications of either query and reference sequences. Through simulations we evaluate different recombinant identification statistics and significance tests. We compare the quartet approach with triplet-based methods that employ additional heuristic tests to identify parental and recombinant sequences. Analysis of phylogenetic simulations reveal that identifying the descendents of relatively old recombination events is a challenging task for all methods available, and that quartet scanning performs relatively well compared to the triplet based methods. The use of quartet scanning is further demonstrated by analyzing both well-established and putative HIV-1 recombinant strains. In agreement with recent findings, we provide evidence that the presumed circulating recombinant CRF02_AG is a 'pure' lineage, whereas the presumed parental lineage subtype G has a recombinant origin. We also demonstrate HIV-1 intrasubtype recombination, confirm the hybrid origin of SIV in chimpanzees and further disentangle the recombinant history of SIV lineages in a primate immunodeficiency virus data set. Quartet scanning makes a valuable addition to triplet-based methods for identifying recombinant sequences without prior specifications of either query and reference sequences.

That region of the mRNA can fold in two mutually exclusive conformations that are in dynamic equilibrium: a structure with two hairpins and a pseudoknot. A mutational analysis provided evidence for the existence and requirement of the pseudoknot for translational control in vivo and S15 recognition in vitro. In this study, we used chemical probing to analyze the structural consequences of mutations and their effect on the stem-loop/pseudoknot equilibrium. Interactions between S15 and the pseudoknot structure were further investigated by footprinting experiments. These data, combined with computer modelling and the previously published data on S15 binding and in vivo control, provide important clues on pseudoknot formation and S15 recognition. An unexpected result is that the relevant control element, here the pseudoknot form, can exist in a variety of topologically equivalent structures recognizable and shapable by S15. S15 sits on the deep groove of the co-axial stack and makes contacts with both stems, shielding the bridging adenine. The only specific sequence determinants are found in the helix common to the pseudoknot and the hairpin structures.	adenine;bridging (networking);computer simulation;equilibrium;experiment;footprinting;genetic translation process;interaction;ligand binding domain;mutation;ribosomal proteins;ribosomes;scientific publication;translational regulation;video-in video-out	Claude Philippe;Lionel Bénard;Claude Portier;E.

Three genes of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) and proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) are regulating proline metabolism. Until now, little is known about miRNAs regulating proline accumulation. In this work, in order to understand whether miRNAs related to mRNAs of enzymes to regulate proline enrichment under drought stress, we used mRNAs of related enzymes as the targets of miRNAs to search miRBase using BLAST and find many query miRNA sequences. After a range of filtering criteria, 11 known miRNAs classified into 6 miRNA families were predicted. The result from qRT-PCR assay showed that 10 out of 11 predicted miRNAs were successfully detected including 9 down-regulated miRNAs and one up-regulated miRNA. Based on expression and functional analysis, we identified miR172, miR396a, miR396c and miR4233 may regulate P5CS gene, and miR2673 and miR6461 may regulate P5CR and ProDH gene, respectively. The findings can help us make a good understanding of the roles of miRNAs in regulation of proline accumulation and provide molecular evidence for involvement process of drought tolerance in potato.

484817c9094c3636c97a926a1cd4f2a845c876c6	de novo drug design using multiobjective evolutionary graphs	drug design	"""Drug discovery and development is a complex, lengthy process, and failure of a candidate molecule can occur as a result of a combination of reasons, such as poor pharmacokinetics, lack of efficacy, or toxicity. Successful drug candidates necessarily represent a compromise between the numerous, sometimes competing objectives so that the benefits to patients outweigh potential drawbacks and risks. De novo drug design involves searching an immense space of feasible, druglike molecules to select those with the highest chances of becoming drugs using computational technology. Traditionally, de novo design has focused on designing molecules satisfying a single objective, such as similarity to a known ligand or an interaction score, and ignored the presence of the multiple objectives required for druglike behavior. Recently, methods have appeared in the literature that attempt to design molecules satisfying multiple predefined objectives and thereby produce candidate solutions with a higher chance of serving as viable drug leads. This paper describes the Multiobjective Evolutionary Graph Algorithm (MEGA), a new multiobjective optimization de novo design algorithmic framework that can be used to design structurally diverse molecules satisfying one or more objectives. The algorithm combines evolutionary techniques with graph-theory to directly manipulate graphs and perform an efficient global search for promising solutions. In the Experimental Section we present results from the application of MEGA for designing molecules that selectively bind to a known pharmaceutical target using the ChillScore interaction score family. The primary constraints applied to the design are based on the identified structure of the protein target and a known ligand currently marketed as a drug. A detailed explanation of the key elements of the specific implementation of the algorithm is given, including the methods for obtaining molecular building blocks, evolving the chemical graphs, and scoring the designed molecules. Our findings demonstrate that MEGA can produce structurally diverse candidate molecules representing a wide range of compromises of the supplied constraints and thus can be used as an """"idea generator"""" to support expert chemists assigned with the task of molecular design."""	adverse reaction to drug;de novo protein structure prediction;de novo transcriptome assembly;drug design;graph - visual representation;graph theory;ligands;list of algorithms;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;patients;personnameuse - assigned;protein targeting;providing (action);score;solutions;substance abuse detection;algorithm;benefit	Christos A.

680f2bd1cb2fea445badc497bfe580fd990b4185	homology modeling, docking and structure-based pharmacophore of inhibitors of dna methyltransferase	cancer;dnmt;docking;epigenetics;homology model;pharmacophore	DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is an emerging epigenetic target for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. To date, several inhibitors from different structural classes have been published. In this work, we report a comprehensive molecular modeling study of 14 established DNTM1 inhibitors with a herein developed homology model of the catalytic domain of human DNTM1. The geometry of the homology model was in agreement with the proposed mechanism of DNA methylation. Docking results revealed that all inhibitors studied in this work have hydrogen bond interactions with a glutamic acid and arginine residues that play a central role in the mechanism of cytosine DNA methylation. The binding models of compounds such as curcumin and parthenolide suggest that these natural products are covalent blockers of the catalytic site. A pharmacophore model was also developed for all DNMT1 inhibitors considered in this work using the most favorable binding conformations and energetic terms of the docked poses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pharmacophore model proposed for compounds with inhibitory activity of DNMT1. The results presented in this work represent a conceptual advance for understanding the protein-ligand interactions and mechanism of action of DNMT1 inhibitors. The insights obtained in this work can be used for the structure-based design and virtual screening for novel inhibitors targeting DNMT1.	arginine;cmtr1 gene;catalytic domain;curcumin;cytosine;dna computing;dnmt1 gene;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;glutamic acid;homology modeling;hydrogen bonding;methylation;methyltransferase;natural products;neoplasms;pharmacophore;scientific publication;virtual screening;molecular modeling;parthenolide;study of epigenetics	Jakyung Yoo;José L.

a45ab322851603f18e9974d68545c670e5c31645	a contribution to the drug resistance mechanism of darunavir, amprenavir, indinavir, and saquinavir complexes with hiv-1 protease due to flap mutation i50v: a systematic mm-pbsa and thermodynamic integration study		The emergence of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations is the major problem against AIDS treatment. We employed molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and free energy (MM-PBSA and thermodynamic integration) analyses on wild-type (WT) and mutated HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) complexes with darunavir, amprenavir, indinavir, and saquinavir to clarify the mechanism of resistance due to the I50V flap mutation. Conformational analysis showed that the protease flaps are increasingly flexible in the I50V complexes. In the WT, stabilization of the HIV-1 PR structure is achieved via interflap and water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions between the flaps. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds between drugs and binding cavity residues (Asp29/29'/30/30') are crucial for effective inhibition. All these interactions were significantly diminished (or absent) in the mutated forms, thus denoting their importance toward binding. Thermodynamic integration calculations reproduced the experimental data to within ≈1 kcal mol⁻¹ and showed that the I50V mutation results in weaker binding free energies for all analyzed complexes with respect to the WT. It was observed that the loss in binding energy upon mutation was mostly enthalpically driven in all complexes, with the greatest effect coming from the reduction of van der Waals interactions. Our results motivated us to test two novel compounds that have been synthesized to maximize interactions with HIV-1 PR. MM-PBSA and TI calculations showed that compound 3c (Ghosh et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012, 22, 2308) is a promising protease inhibitor, which presents very effective binding to the WT PR (ΔG(MM-PBSA) = -17.2 kcal mol⁻¹, ΔG(exp) = -16.1 kcal mol⁻¹). Upon I50V mutation, the complex binding free energy was weakened by a ΔΔG(TI) of 1.8 kcal mol⁻¹, comparable to the marketed inhibitors. This predicts that I50V may confer low resistance to 3c. This computational comparative study contributes toward elucidation of the I50V drug-resistance mechanism in HIV-1 PR.		Georgios Leonis;Thomas Steinbrecher;Manthos G.

In order to investigate the metabolic characteristics at a systems level and to explore potential strategies for enhanced lipid production, a genome-scale metabolic model of M. alpina was reconstructed. This model included 1106 genes, 1854 reactions and 1732 metabolites. On minimal growth medium, 86 genes were identified as essential, whereas 49 essential genes were identified on yeast extract medium. A series of sequential desaturase and elongase catalysed steps are involved in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from acetyl-CoA precursors, with concomitant NADPH consumption, and these steps were investigated in this study. Oxygen is known to affect the degree of unsaturation of PUFAs, and robustness analysis determined that an oxygen uptake rate of 2.0 mmol gDW−1 h−1 was optimal for ARA accumulation. The flux of 53 reactions involving NADPH was significantly altered at different ARA levels. Of these, malic enzyme (ME) was confirmed as a key component in ARA production and NADPH generation. When using minimization of metabolic adjustment, a knock-out of ME led to a 38.28% decrease in ARA production. The simulation results confirmed the model as a useful tool for future research on the metabolism of PUFAs.	acetyl-coa c-acyltransferase;application release automation;arachidonic acid;culture media;enzyme commission number;forty nine;fungi;fungus identified:prid:pt:xxx:nom:fungus stain;genes, essential;knock-out;malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating);metabolic process, cellular;mortierella;oxygen;polyunsaturated fatty acids;protoventuria alpina;simulation;tree accumulation;desaturase	Chao Ye;Nan Xu;Haiqin Chen;Yong Q.

LKB1 protein is expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus. In the nucleus, LKB1 interacts with orphan nuclear receptor protein Nur77. It is reported that the interaction of LKB1 with Nur77 is disrupted by the small molecular ligand TMPA (ethyl 2-[2,3,4-trimethoxy-6-(1-octanoyl)phenyl]acetate), such that the LKB1 is enabled to play its role in cytoplasm and further to regulate/reduce the blood glucose level. In the present study, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are performed to understand the dissociation mechanism of Nur77-LKB1 complex. The present study reveals that TMPAs induce an open-close motion of Nur77 which further decrease the stability of Nur77-LKB1 complex. As a consequence, the interface region in LKB1-Nur77 complex is more exposed for solvation and further releases the interactions existing between Nur77 and LKB1. Altogether, this study explains the TMPAs mediated Nur77-LKB1 complex dissociation.	blood glucose;cell nucleus;interaction;ligands;molecular dynamics;nr4a1 gene;nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group a, member 1;receptors, nuclear;stk11 protein, human;simulation;polarity	Ikrormi Rungsung;Muthukumaran Rajagopalan;Amutha Ramaswamy	2018	Computational biology and chemistry	10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2018.06.002	nerve growth factor ib;cell polarity;genetics;ampk;phosphorylation;nuclear receptor;cell biology;solvation;cytoplasm;biology;ligand	Comp.	8.391564690453535	-63.12144448652278	164552

Unlike most candidate explanations, this paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any pressure to adapt. The insight is that if evolvability is heritable, then an unbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of phenotypes biased towards evolvability, because evolvable organisms diffuse more quickly through the space of possible phenotypes. Furthermore, because phenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may on average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a genotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these two mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to out-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series of simulated models. Thus rather than from pressure to adapt, evolvability may inevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with evolution's passive tendency to accumulate niches.	experiment;genotype;mathematical model;niche blogging;phenotype;population growth;simulation;explanation	Joel Lehman;Kenneth O.

From these calculations, rates of folding and hybridisation are estimated and used in a stochastic simulation of the dynamics of a population of ribopolymerase molecules. Two models are considered: one synthesising a conventional antiparallel reverse complementary transcript and one synthesising a parallel complementary transcript. It was found that the latter system can operate much more effective in the higher temperatures thought to prevail during the RNA world.		William R.

In order to better understand metabolism and optimize their application, we have developed a pan-genome-scale metabolic network and constraint-based metabolic model of Dehalococcoides. The pan-genome was constructed from publicly available complete genome sequences of Dehalococcoides sp. strain CBDB1, strain 195, strain BAV1, and strain VS. We found that Dehalococcoides pan-genome consisted of 1118 core genes (shared by all), 457 dispensable genes (shared by some), and 486 unique genes (found in only one genome). The model included 549 metabolic genes that encoded 356 proteins catalyzing 497 gene-associated model reactions. Of these 497 reactions, 477 were associated with core metabolic genes, 18 with dispensable genes, and 2 with unique genes. This study, in addition to analyzing the metabolism of an environmentally important phylogenetic group on a pan-genome scale, provides valuable insights into Dehalococcoides metabolic limitations, low growth yields, and energy conservation. The model also provides a framework to anchor and compare disparate experimental data, as well as to give insights on the physiological impact of """"incomplete"""" pathways, such as the TCA-cycle, CO(2) fixation, and cobalamin biosynthesis pathways. The model, referred to as iAI549, highlights the specialized and highly conserved nature of Dehalococcoides metabolism, and suggests that evolution of Dehalococcoides species is driven by the electron acceptor availability."""	acceptor (semiconductors);advanced telecommunications computing architecture;conserved sequence;dehalococcoides;electron;metabolic process, cellular;organic chemicals;oxidants;phylogenetics;vitamin b 12;cobalamin biosynthetic process	M.

However, the male reproductive toxicity blocks its wider clinical applications. With the mechanisms of male toxicity is still obscure, it is difficult to tackle its toxicity. In this study, triptolide's male reproductive toxicity mechanisms were carried out through integrated bioinformatics analysis which covers target proteins, further regulated testis proteins, biological process enrichment, and protein-protein interactions. As a result, (1) MYC was identified as the target protein; (2) testis proteins of CCNB1, EZH2, PEG10, and THBS1 were found participated in spermatogenesis; and (3) 3 new candidate testis proteins of CHKA, GAS1, and RCC1 were proposed which might be connected to the male reproductive toxicity.	bioinformatics;gene ontology term enrichment;interaction	Guang Zheng;Minghui Yang;Yun Yang;Jihua Wang;Hongtao Guo;Xiaojuan He	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822666	pharmacology;biology;genomics;immune system;toxicology;bioinformatics;immunology	Visualization	7.74344838208163	-60.5759914466753	166278

Herkinorin is one of the most remarkable salvinorin A derivative with high affinity for the mu opioid receptor, moderate selectivity and lack of nitrogen atoms on its structure. Surprisingly, binding models for herkinorin are lacking. In this work, we explore binding models of herkinorin using automated docking, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations and available experimental information. Our herkinorin D-ICM-1 binding model predicted a binding free energy of -11.52 ± 1.14 kcal mol-1 by alchemical free energy estimations, which is close to the experimental values -10.91 ± 0.2 and -10.80 ± 0.05 kcal mol-1 and is in agreement with experimental structural information. Specifically, D-ICM-1 molecular dynamics simulations showed a water-mediated interaction between D-ICM-1 and the amino acid H2976.52, this interaction coincides with the co-crystallized ligands. Another relevant interaction, with N1272.63, allowed to rationalize herkinorin's selectivity to mu over delta opioid receptors. Our suggested binding model for herkinorin is in agreement with this and additional experimental data. The most remarkable observation derived from our D-ICM-1 model is that herkinorin reaches an allosteric sodium ion binding site near N1503.35. Key interactions in that region appear relevant for the lack of β-arrestin recruitment by herkinorin. This interaction is key for downstream signaling pathways involved in the development of side effects, such as tolerance. Future SAR studies and medicinal chemistry efforts will benefit from the structural information presented in this work.	amino acids;crystal structure;dna binding site;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;downstream (software development);gain;information science;ions;ligands;medicinal chemistry;modulation;molecular dynamics;name;opioid receptor;opioids;pain;processor affinity;receptors, opioid, delta;selectivity (electronic);side effect (computer science);simulation;sodium cation;biological signaling;free energy;gamma-delta t-cell receptor;kilocalorie;salvinorin a;sodium ion binding	A.

The activity does not require divalent metal ions and is not affected by EDTA. It is specific for the repair of O6-methylguanine lesions and does not affect the removal of 7-methylguanine, 7-methyladenine or 3-methyladenine. The disappearance of O6-methylguanine is linear with respect to the concentration of protein and is dependent on incubation temperature. The kinetics and substrate dependence experiments suggest that the protein factor is product-inactivated. Amino acid analysis of hydrolysates of protein obtained after incubation of methylated DNA with the protein factor indicates the presence of radiolabeled S-methyl-L-cysteine, suggesting that during the repair of O6-methylguanine from methylated DNA, the methyl group is transferred to a sulfhydryl of a cysteine residue of a protein. This represents the first such demonstration in a mammalian system.	3-methyladenine;7-methyladenine;7-methylguanine;amino acids;ammonium sulfate;cellulose;dna computing;edetic acid;experiment;ions;kinetics internet protocol;mammals;methyl group;methylnitrosourea;o-(6)-methylguanine;staphylococcal protein a;sulfhydryl compounds	J.

e749bc1240b861534a663c94b8bb0920aff41e81	caspneurod: a knowledgebase of predicted caspase cleavage sites in human proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases		BACKGROUND A variety of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have been associated with deregulated caspase activation that leads to neuronal death. Caspases appear to be involved in the molecular pathology of NDs by directly cleaving important proteins. For instance, several proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease, including β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins, are known to be cleaved by caspases. Therefore, cell death pathway may play a central role in many neurological diseases, and targeting the important proteins that control the cell survival and death may potentially represent a therapeutic approach for chronic neurodegenerative disorders.   FINDINGS We developed CaspNeuroD, a relational database of in silico predicted caspase cleavage sites in human proteins associated with NDs. The prediction has been done on collection of 249 human proteins reported in clinical studies of NDs using the recently published CaspDB Random Forest machine-learning model. This database could be used for identifying new caspase substrates and further our understanding of the caspase-mediated substrate cleavage in NDs.   CONCLUSION Our database provides information about potential caspase cleavage sites in a verified set of human proteins involved in NDs. It provides also information about the conservation of cleavage positions in corresponding orthologs, and information about the positions of single nucleotide polymorphisms and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that may modulate the caspase cleavage efficiency.Database URL: caspdb.sanfordburnham.org/caspneurod.php.	activation function;alzheimer's disease;caspase activation;cell death;cell survival;cell signaling;cleaved cell;deregulation;gene regulatory network;homology (biology);knowledge bases;knowledge base;machine learning;molecular pathology (discipline);neurodegenerative disorders;nucleotides;post-translational protein processing;presenilins;random forest;relational database;scientific publication;single nucleotide polymorphism;uniform resource locator;nervous system disorder	Sonu Kumar;Piotr Cieplak	2016		10.1093/database/baw142	biology;molecular biology;cell biology;bioinformatics	Comp.	6.647310100829156	-60.77819838585274	167436

Contaminated soils may play roles as reservoirs and sources of transmission for TMV. In this study we report the development of an immunocapture real-time RT-PCR (IC-real-time RT-PCR) assay for direct detection of TMV in soils without RNA isolation. A series of TMV infected leaf sap dilutions of 1:101, 1:102, 1:103, 1:104, 1:105 and 1:106 (w/v, g/mL) were added to one gram of soil. The reactivity of DAS-ELISA and conventional RT-PCR was in the range of 1:102 and 1:103 dilution in TMV-infested soils, respectively. Meanwhile, the detection limit of IC-real-time RT-PCR sensitivity was up to 1:106 dilution. However, in plant sap infected by TMV, both IC-real-time RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR were up to 1:106 dilution, DAS-ELISA could detect at least 1:103 dilution. IC-real-time RT-PCR method can use either plant sample extracts or cultivated soils, and show higher sensitivity than RT-PCR and DAS-ELISA for detection of TMV in soils. Therefore, the proposed IC-real-time RT-PCR assay provides an alternative for quick and very sensitive detection of TMV in soils, with the advantage of not requiring a concentration or RNA purification steps while still allowing detection of TMV for disease control.	avian crop;enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay;hepatitis b;mosaic organism;mosaic viruses;purification of quantum state;rna isolation;real-time polymerase chain reaction;real-time clock;real-time transcription;reservoir device component;reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction;role playing disorder;soil;tobacco mosaic virus;virus diseases;windows rt;amsonic acid;gram	Jin-Guang Yang;Feng-Long Wang;De-xin Chen;Li-Li Shen;Yu-Mei Qian;Zhi-Yong Liang;Wen-Chang Zhou;Tai-He Yan	2012		10.3390/s121216685	real-time polymerase chain reaction;leaf;tobacco mosaic virus;soil microbiology	Embedded	4.868835506561875	-65.92392752264603	167617

We extracted the α-helical peptide segments that share common secondary-structure environments in the capsid protein-protein interfaces of three unrelated virus classes (PRD1-like, HK97-like, and BTV-like) that encompass different levels of pathogenicity to humans, animals, and plants. The potential for the binding of these peptides to the individual capsid proteins was then investigated using blind docking simulations. Most of the extracted α-helical peptides were found to interact favorably with one or more of the protein-protein interfaces within the capsid in all three classes of virus. Moreover, binding of these peptides to the interface regions was found to block one or more of the putative """"hot spot"""" regions on the protein interface, thereby providing the potential to disrupt virus capsid assembly via competitive interaction with other capsid proteins. In particular, binding of the GDFNALSN peptide was found to block interface """"hot spot"""" regions in most of the viruses, providing a potential lead for broad-spectrum antiviral drug therapy."""	antiviral agents;assembly language;brake to vacate;capsid proteins;class;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;extraction;hotspot (wi-fi);interface device component;pathogenicity;simulation;virus	Karim M.

In these networks, intracellular and extracellular signals are integrated by transcription factors, which control the expression of transcription units by binding to cis-regulatory regions on the DNA. The designs of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cis-regulatory regions are usually highly complex. They frequently consist of both repetitive and overlapping transcription factor binding sites. To unravel the design principles of these promoter architectures, we have designed in silico prokaryotic transcriptional logic gates with predefined input-output relations using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting cis-regulatory designs are often composed of modules that consist of tandem arrays of binding sites to which the transcription factors bind cooperatively. Moreover, these modules often overlap with each other, leading to competition between them. Our analysis thus identifies a new signal integration motif that is based upon the interplay between intramodular cooperativity and intermodular competition. We show that this signal integration mechanism drastically enhances the capacity of cis-regulatory domains to integrate signals. Our results provide a possible explanation for the complexity of promoter architectures and could be used for the rational design of synthetic gene circuits.	architecture as topic;artificial gene synthesis;binding sites;computation;evolutionary algorithm;f factor;gene regulatory network;logic gate;medical transcription;motif;regulatory sequences, nucleic acid;synthetic intelligence;transcription factor;transcription (software);transcription, genetic	Rutger Hermsen;Sander Tans;Pieter Rein ten Wolde	2006	PLoS Computational Biology	10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020164	computer simulation;biology;cis-regulatory element;molecular biology;bioinformatics;enhancer;cis-regulatory module;eukaryotic transcription;sp3 transcription factor;response element;genetics;general transcription factor;promoter;dna binding site;transcription coregulator;transcription factor	Comp.	5.78340129487993	-64.93363103964508	167962

The location and amount of meiotic DSBs can be examined by using a common molecular biological technique called Southern blotting, but only a subset of the total DSBs can be observed; only DSB fragments still carrying the region recognized by a Southern blot probe are detected. With the assumption that DSB formation follows a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, we propose two estimators of the total number of DSBs on a chromosome: (1) an estimator based on the Nelson-Aalen estimator, and (2) an estimator based on a record value process. Further, we compared their asymptotic accuracy.

Essential amino acid deficiencies have negative impacts on animal physiology, most often expressed in sub-optimal body weight gains. Over supplementation of diets with amino acids is costly and can increase the nitrogen emissions from animals. Although in vivo animal assays for quantification of amino acid bioavailability are well established, Escherichia coli-based bioassays are viable potential alternatives in terms of accuracy, cost, and time input. E. coli inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and although more abundant in colon, a relatively high titer of E. coli can also be isolated from the small intestine, where primary absorption of amino acids and peptides occur. After feed proteins are digested, liberated amino acids and small peptides are assimilated by both the small intestine and E. coli. The similar pattern of uptake is a necessary prerequisite to establish E. coli cells as accurate amino acid biosensors. In fact, amino acid transporters in both intestinal and E. coli cells are stereospecific, delivering only the respective biological l-forms. The presence of free amino- and carboxyl groups is critical for amino acid and dipeptide transport in both biological subjects. Di-, tri- and tetrapeptides can enter enterocytes; likewise only di-, tri- and tetrapeptides support E. coli growth. These similarities in addition to the well known bacterial genetics make E. coli an optimal bioassay microorganism for the assessment of nutritionally available amino acids in feeds.	amino acid metabolism, inborn errors;amino acid transporter;amino acids;bacterial genetics;biological assay;cdisc sdtm microorganism terminology;carboxyl group;colon classification;dipeptides;emission - male genitalia finding;enterocytes;escherichia coli;gastrointestinal tract structure;human body weight;membrane transport proteins;ploidies;quantitation;quantity;small intestinal wall tissue;tract (literature);video-in video-out;whole earth 'lectronic link;dipeptide transport;physiological aspects	Vesela I.

The model is often described in terms of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which generate a probability distribution over secondary structures. It is, however, unclear how this probability distribution changes as a function of the input alignment. As prediction programs typically only return a single secondary structure, better characterisation of the underlying probability space of RNA secondary structures is of great interest. In this work, we show how to efficiently compute the information entropy of the probability distribution over RNA secondary structures produced for RNA alignments by a phylo-SCFG, and implement it for the PPfold model. We also discuss interpretations and applications of this quantity, including how it can clarify reasons for low prediction reliability scores.

Among the most important and broadly studied of these roles is reversible phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, part of a complex array of CTD/protein interactions that coordinate the RNAP II transcription cycle. The RNAP CTD is strongly conserved in some groups of eukaryotes, but highly degenerate or absent in others; the reasons for these differences in stabilizing selection on CTD structure are not clear. Given the importance of reversible phosphorylation for CTD-based transcription, the distribution and evolutionary history of CDKs may be a key to understanding differences in constraints on CTD structure; however, the origins and evolutionary relationships of CTD kinases have not been investigated thoroughly. Moreover, although the functions of most CDKs are reasonably well studied in mammals and yeasts, very little is known from most other eukaryotes. Here we identify 123 CDK family members from animals, plants, yeasts, and four protists from which genome sequences have been completed, and 10 additional CDKs from incomplete genome sequences of organisms with known CTD sequences. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that cell-cycle CDKs are present in all organisms sampled in this study. In contrast, no clear orthologs of transcription-related CDKs are identified in the most putatively ancestral eukaryotes, Trypanosoma or Giardia. Kinases involved in CTD phosphorylation, CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9, all are recovered as well-supported and distinct orthologous families, but their relationships to each other and other CDKs are not well-resolved. Significantly, clear orthologs of CDK7 and CDK8 are restricted to only those organisms belonging to groups in which the RNAP II CTD is strongly conserved. The apparent origins of CDK7 and CDK8, or at least their conservation as clearly recognizable orthologous families, correlate with strong stabilizing selection on RNAP II CTD structure. This suggests co-evolution of the CTD and these CTD-directed CDKs. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that CDK7 and CDK8 originated at about the same time that the CTD was canalized as the staging platform RNAP II transcription. Alternatively, extensive CTD phosphorylation may occur in only a subset of eukaryotes and, when present, this interaction results in greater stabilizing selection on both CTD and CDK sequences. Overall, our results suggest that transcription-related kinases originated after cell-cycle related CDKs, and became more evolutionarily and functionally diverse as transcriptional complexity increased.	abnormal degeneration;cdk;cdk7 gene;cdk8 gene;cdk9 gene;comparative toxicogenomics database (ctd);cyclins;disk staging;genomics;homology (biology);interaction;mammals;national origin;nuclear lim interactor-interacting factor 2;organism;partial;protein family;sequence homology;subgroup;transcription (software);transcription, genetic;trypanosoma;yeasts;negative regulation of phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain;protists	Zhenhua Guo;John W.

7ef244c8b4c3afb560ee8ab526185cd656d9b925	new insights into genotype-phenotype correlation in individuals with different level of general non-specific reactivity of an organism		The objective of the study was to investigate the genetic basis of general non-specific reactivity of an organism. Systematic search in PubMedCentral, PDB, KEGG and SNP databases identified a set of genes and their polymorphisms that can determine pain sensitivity and therefore the level of general non-specific reactivity of the human organism. Six SNPs were selected for genotyping kit design; 230 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. It was revealed that very high pain threshold was associated with allele A in rs1851048 and allele C in rs6777055. High level of general non-specific reactivity of an organism was associated with allele G in rs2562456 (OR=1.804, CI=1.139-2.857, p=0.011) and allele C in rs6923492 (OR=1.582, CI=1.071-2.335, p=0.021). Low level of general non-specific reactivity of an organism was associated with allele T in rs6923492 (OR=0.351, CI=0.154-0.799, p=0.010). A set of genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the pain sensitivity and indirectly with the level of general non-specific reactivity of human organism were determined. The identified correlations reveal some molecular mechanisms of general non-specific reactivity of an organism variability and can guide further research in this area.

However, standard methods of analysis used in the field and experimental artifacts can bias interpretations and obscure important aspects of cell migration such as directional migration and non-Brownian walk statistics. Therefore, methods were developed for minimizing drift artifacts, identifying directional and anisotropic (asymmetric) migration, and classifying cell migration statistics. These methods were applied to describe the migration statistics of CD8+ T cells in uninflamed lymph nodes. Contrary to current models, CD8+ T cell statistics are not well described by a straightforward persistent random walk model. Instead, a model in which one population of cells moves via Brownian-like motion and another population follows variable persistent random walks with noise reproduces multiple statistical measures of CD8+ T cell migration in the lymph node in the absence of inflammation.	anatomic node;body tissue;brownian motion;cellular phone;classification;interpretation process;leukemia, b-cell;migration, cell;morphologic artifacts;photons;t cell migration;t-lymphocyte;lymph nodes	Edward J.

It can evaluate how robustly a network sustains a stable state against mutations by employing a Boolean network model. In addition, the plugin can examine all feedforward/feedback loops appearing in a network and determine whether or not a pair of loops is coupled. Random networks can also be generated to evaluate whether or not an interesting finding in real biological networks is significantly random.

Our simulation, which incorporates 30 years of genetic, biochemical, physiological, and biophysical data, is used here to study how the intracellular resources of the host, determined by the specific growth rate of the host, contribute toward phage development. It is also used to probe how changes in the linear organization of genetic elements on the T7 genome can affect T7 development. Further, we show how time-series trajectories of T7 mRNA and protein levels generated by the simulation may be used as raw data to test data-mining strategies, specifically, to identify partners in protein-protein interactions. Finally, we suggest how generalization of this work can lead to a knowledge-driven simulation for the growth of any virus.	bacteriophage t7;computer simulation;data mining;generalization (psychology);genetics, biochemical;test data;time series;protein protein interaction	Lingchong You;John Yin	2001	Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

A single miRNA concurrently downregulates hundreds of target mRNAs designated “targetome”, and thereby fine-tunes gene expression involved in diverse cellular functions, such as development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. Recently, we characterized the molecular network of the whole human miRNA targetome by using bioinformatics tools for analyzing molecular interactions on the comprehensive knowledgebase. We found that the miRNA targetome regulated by an individual miRNA generally constitutes the biological network of functionally-associated molecules in human cells, closely linked to pathological events involved in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We also identified a collaborative regulation of gene expression by transcription factors and miRNAs in cancer-associated miRNA targetome networks. This review focuses on the workflow of molecular network analysis of miRNA targetome in silico. We applied the workflow to two representative datasets, composed of miRNA expression profiling of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. The results supported the view that miRNAs act as a central regulator of both oncogenesis and neurodegeneration.	alzheimer's disease;apoptosis;bioinformatics;biological network;cell signaling;cellular phone;chronic lymphocytic leukemia;elegant degradation;gene expression regulation;gene expression profiling;interaction;knowledge bases;knowledge base;malignant neoplasms;micrornas;molecular profiling;neurodegenerative disorders;primary microrna;rna, messenger;transcription factor;transcription (software);translational repression;untranslated regions;nervous system disorder	Jun-ichi Satoh	2012		10.1186/1756-0381-5-17	biology;medical research;gene silencing;computer science;bioinformatics;data mining;genetics	Comp.	5.142121971234826	-59.12296840667585	170608

Understanding these mechanisms is important for breeding cold-resistant wheat cultivars. In this study, we combined three computational techniques for the analysis of gene expression data from spring and winter wheat cultivars subjected to low temperature treatments. Our main objective was to construct a comprehensive network of cold response transcriptional events in wheat, and to identify novel cold tolerance candidate genes in wheat. We assigned novel cold stress-related roles to 35 wheat genes, uncovered novel transcription (TF)-gene interactions, and identified 127 genes representing known and novel candidate targets associated with cold tolerance in wheat. Our results also show that delays in terms of activation or repression of the same genes across wheat cultivars play key roles in phenotypic differences among winter and spring wheat cultivars, and adaptation to low temperature stress, cold shock and cold acclimation. Using three computational approaches, we identified novel putative cold-response genes and TF-gene interactions. These results provide new insights into the complex mechanisms regulating the expression of cold-responsive genes in wheat.	acclimatization;bioinformatics;candidate disease gene;cold temperature;computation;cooperative breeding;gene expression;interaction;personnameuse - assigned;repression, psychology;shock;transcription (software);transcription, genetic;cold acclimation	Alain B.

In this report we investigate how this structural property, either alone or together with other structural and sequence attributes, may be used to search prokaryotic genomes for promoters. We show that the propensity for stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) is closely associated with specific promoter regions. The extent of destabilization in promoter-containing regions is found to be bimodally distributed. When compared with DNA curvature, deformability, thermostability or sequence motif scores within the -10 region, SIDD is found to be the most informative DNA property regarding promoter locations in the E. coli K12 genome. SIDD properties alone perform better at detecting promoter regions than other programs trained on this genome. Because this approach has a very low false positive rate, it can be used to predict with high confidence the subset of promoters that are strongly destabilized. When SIDD properties are combined with -10 motif scores in a linear classification function, they predict promoter regions with better than 80% accuracy. When these methods were tested with promoter and non-promoter sequences from Bacillus subtilis, they achieved similar or higher accuracies. We also present a strictly SIDD-based predictor for annotating promoter sequences in complete microbial genomes. In this report we show that the propensity to undergo stress-induced duplex destabilization (SIDD) is a distinctive structural attribute of many prokaryotic promoter sequences. We have developed methods to identify promoter sequences in prokaryotic genomes that use SIDD either as a sole predictor or in combination with other DNA structural and sequence properties. Although these methods cannot predict all the promoter-containing regions in a genome, they do find large sets of potential regions that have high probabilities of being true positives. This approach could be especially valuable for annotating those genomes about which there is limited experimental data.	annotation;dna binding site;duplex (telecommunications);genome;genome, microbial;induced subgraph;inference;information;kerrison predictor;linear classifier;probability;promoter regions, genetic;sensor;sequence motif;subgroup;video-in video-out	Huiquan Wang;Craig J.

Prediction and identification of DDIs are extremely vital for the patient safety and success of treatment modalities. A number of computational methods have been employed for the prediction of DDIs based on drugs structures and/or functions. Here, we report on a computational method for DDIs prediction based on functional similarity of drugs. The model was set based on key biological elements including carriers, transporters, enzymes and targets (CTET). The model was applied for 2189 approved drugs. For each drug, all the associated CTETs were collected, and the corresponding binary vectors were constructed to determine the DDIs. Various similarity measures were conducted to detect DDIs. Of the examined similarity methods, the inner product-based similarity measures (IPSMs) were found to provide improved prediction values. Altogether, 2,394,766 potential drug pairs interactions were studied. The model was able to predict over 250,000 unknown potential DDIs. Upon our findings, we propose the current method as a robust, yet simple and fast, universal in silico approach for identification of DDIs. We envision that this proposed method can be used as a practical technique for the detection of possible DDIs based on the functional similarities of drugs.	computation;drug interactions;interaction;membrane transport proteins	Reza Ferdousi;Reza Safdari;Yadollah Omidi	2017	Journal of biomedical informatics	10.1016/j.jbi.2017.04.021	toxicology;bioinformatics	Comp.	8.742104843925723	-60.77988509164703	171776

To date, most progress has been limited to rare conditions in which mutation of a single gene is both necessary and sufficient to cause disease. In common diseases, in contrast, multiple genes combine with environmental influences, meaning that the contribution of any single gene variant is probabilistic rather than deterministic. Where gene effects are partial, rather than complete, their effects can only be demonstrated by measuring frequencies of variants in collections of patients and controls much larger than a single family.

Current methods for detecting bi-stable RNAs that can lead to structural switching when triggered by an outside event rely on kinetics, energetics and properties of the combinatorial structure space of RNAs. Based on these properties, tools have been developed to predict whether a given sequence folds to a structure characterized by a bi-stable conformation, or to design multi-stable RNAs by an iterative algorithm. A useful addition is in developing a local procedure to prescribe, given an initial sequence, the least amount of mutations needed to drive the system into an optimal bi-stable conformation.   RESULTS We introduce a local procedure for predicting mutations, by generating and analyzing eigenvalue tables, that are capable of transforming the wild-type sequence into a bi-stable conformation. The method is independent of the folding algorithms but relies on their success. It can be used in conjunction with existing tools, as well as being incorporated into more general RNA prediction packages. We apply this procedure on three well-studied structures. First, the method is validated on the mutation leading to a conformational switch in the spliced leader RNA from Leptomonas collosoma, a mutation that has already been confirmed by an experiment. Second, the method is used to predict a mutation that can lead to a novel conformational switch in the P5abc subdomain of the group I intron ribozyme in Tetrahymena thermophila. Third, the method is applied on Hepatitis delta virus to predict mutations that transform the wild-type into a bi-stable conformation, a configuration assessed by calculating the free energies using folding prediction algorithms. The predictions in the final examples need to be verified experimentally, whereas the mutation predicted in the first example complies with the experiment. This supports the use of our proposed method on other known structures, as well as genetically engineered ones.

(1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 10671-10675]. In this approach, T4 RNA ligase is used to join cellular RNA with a defined ribo-oligonucleotide. Although several additional enzymatic steps are involved in this type of analysis, the reliability of the entire procedure is determined by the initial ligation step, which marks and preserves the termini of cellular RNA molecules. We applied this approach to the analysis of the 5' terminus of beta globin mRNA in various murine erythroid cells. As expected, we detected RNA molecules with 5' ends terminating at the regular cap site as well as globin RNA molecules truncated at the 5' end. Unexpectedly, we also detected a class of beta globin mRNA which is identical to regular beta globin mRNA in every respect but contains 17, 29, or 31 additional nucleotides 5' to the regular cap site. These extensions correspond precisely to the genomic segments just upstream of the regular cap site and are probably generated by initiation of transcription of the globin gene upstream from the regular cap site. It is likely that the extended globin RNA is transcribed not from the TATA promoter, which regulates the transcription of regular murine globin mRNA, but from the GATA regulatory element located 30 nucleotides upstream of the 31-nucleotide extension, in a position identical to that of the active GATA promoter of the TATA-less chicken beta globin gene. The evolutionary conservation of this relationship suggests the importance of the GATA promoter element of the mouse beta globin gene and its possible involvement in developmental regulation of expression of this gene.	conserved sequence;erythroid cells;gene amplification technique;ligase;ligation;newman's lemma;nucleotides;qrsl1 gene;rna;regulatory sequences, nucleic acid;transcription (software);transcription initiation;untranslated regions;activated t cell autonomous cell death;beta-globins;globin activity	Vladimir Volloch;Bruce Schweitzer;Sophia Rits	1994	Nucleic acids research	10.1093/nar/22.13.2507	globin;biology;molecular biology;bioinformatics;genetics	Comp.	4.1780597783008515	-63.704382713707375	172271

As the most promising native strain for pentose fermentation, Scheffersomyces stipitis (formerly known as Pichia stipitis) has been widely studied for its xylose fermentation. In spite of the abundant experimental evidence regarding ethanol and by-products production under various aeration conditions, the mathematical descriptions of the processes are rare. In this work, the constraint-based metabolic network model for the central carbon metabolism of S. stipitis was reconstructed by integrating genomic (P. stipitis v2.0, KEGG), biochemical (ChEBI, KEGG) and physiological information available for this microorganisms and other related yeast. The model consists of the stoichiometry of metabolic reactions, the biosynthetic requirements for growth and other constraints. Flux Balance Analysis is applied to characterize the phenotypic behavior of S. stipitis grown on xylose. The model predictions are in good agreement with published experimental results. In addition, a series of specially designed in silico experiments are performed, and PCA has been applied to analyze the results to elucidate the redox balance of S. stipitis for xylose fermentation. The analysis revealed key metabolic reactions related to redox homeostasis and could provide important insights on cofactor engineering of xylose metabolism.	chebi;detailed balance;experiment;flux balance analysis;form-based authentication;gene regulatory network;homeostasis;kegg;network model;norm (social);principal component analysis;requirement	Meng Liang;Q.

Spatially extended systems are known to reduce harmful effects of parasites. Here we present a spatial system to show that evolution of replication is (indirectly) enhanced by strong parasites, and we characterise the phase transition that leads to this mode of evolution. Building on the insights of this analysis, we identify two scenarios, namely periodic disruptions and longer replication time-span, in which speciation occurs and an evolved parasite-like lineage enables the evolutionary increase of replication rates in replicators. Finally, we show that parasites co-evolving with replicators are selected to become weaker, i.e. worse templates for replication when the duration of replication is increased. We conclude that parasites may not be considered a problem for evolution in a prebiotic system, but a degree of freedom that can be exploited by evolution to enhance the evolvability of replicators, by means of emergent levels of selection.	clinical use template;emergence;lineage (evolution);parasites;phase transition;replicator (stargate);source-to-source compiler;span distance	Enrico Sandro Colizzi;Paulien Hogeweg	2016		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004902	biology;speciation;theoretical ecology;population dynamics;pattern formation;ecology;genetics		6.599594485392668	-63.68940973155749	173212

Its high level of antibiotic resistance is an increasing concern in treatments against its infection. Strain B. cenocepacia J2315 is the most infectious isolate from CF patients. There is a strong demand to reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic network of B. cenocepacia J2315 to systematically analyze its metabolic capabilities and its virulence traits, and to search for potential clinical therapy targets. We reconstructed the genome-scale metabolic network of B. cenocepacia J2315. An iterative reconstruction process led to the establishment of a robust model, i KF1028, which accounts for 1,028 genes, 859 internal reactions, and 834 metabolites. The model i KF1028 captures important metabolic capabilities of B. cenocepacia J2315 with a particular focus on the biosyntheses of key metabolic virulence factors to assist in understanding the mechanism of disease infection and identifying potential drug targets. The model was tested through BIOLOG assays. Based on the model, the genome annotation of B. cenocepacia J2315 was refined and 24 genes were properly re-annotated. Gene and enzyme essentiality were analyzed to provide further insights into the genome function and architecture. A total of 45 essential enzymes were identified as potential therapeutic targets. As the first genome-scale metabolic network of B. cenocepacia J2315, i KF1028 allows a systematic study of the metabolic properties of B. cenocepacia and its key metabolic virulence factors affecting the CF community. The model can be used as a discovery tool to design novel drugs against diseases caused by this notorious pathogen.	annotation;antibiotic resistance, microbial;burkholderia cenocepacia;cystic fibrosis;drug delivery systems;eaf2 gene;high-level programming language;iteration;iterative reconstruction;metabolic process, cellular;paget's disease, mammary;pathogenic organism;patients;virulence	Kechi Fang;Hansheng Zhao;Changyue Sun;Carolyn M.

8eca6f206a2a280e62aa2b67aaebd7311fd7c07d	prediction of membrane protein types by incorporating amphipathic effects	membrane protein	According to their intramolecular arrangement and position in a cell, membrane proteins are generally classified into the following six types: (1) type I transmembrane, (2) type II transmembrane, (3) multipass transmembrane, (4) lipid chain-anchored membrane, (5) GPI-anchored membrane, and (6) peripheral membrane. Situated in a heteropolar environment, these six types of membrane proteins must have quite different amphiphilic sequence-order patterns in order to stabilize their respective frameworks. To incorporate such a feature into the predictor, the amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition has been formulated that contains a series of hydrophobic and hydrophilic correlation factors. The success rates thus obtained have been remarkably enhanced in identifying the types of membrane proteins, as demonstrated by the jackknife test and independent data set test, respectively.	amino acids;classification;general-purpose input/output;jackknife resampling;kerrison predictor;membrane proteins;peripheral;pseudo amino acid composition;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;situated;tissue membrane	Kuo-Chen Chou;Yu Dong Cai	2005	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci049686v	pseudo amino acid composition;bioinformatics;situated;transmembrane protein;integral membrane protein;membrane protein;peripheral membrane protein;orientations of proteins in membranes database;membrane;chemistry;biochemistry;chromatography	ML	9.709712794560573	-60.17240618387116	173793
7e10b60d73db80778054efe5457d7fdca467027b	coupling of lever arm swing and biased brownian motion in actomyosin	static electricity;article publisher;actomyosin;colloids;protein conformation;monte carlo method	An important unresolved problem associated with actomyosin motors is the role of Brownian motion in the process of force generation. On the basis of structural observations of myosins and actins, the widely held lever-arm hypothesis has been proposed, in which proteins are assumed to show sequential structural changes among observed and hypothesized structures to exert mechanical force. An alternative hypothesis, the Brownian motion hypothesis, has been supported by single-molecule experiments and emphasizes more on the roles of fluctuating protein movement. In this study, we address the long-standing controversy between the lever-arm hypothesis and the Brownian motion hypothesis through in silico observations of an actomyosin system. We study a system composed of myosin II and actin filament by calculating free-energy landscapes of actin-myosin interactions using the molecular dynamics method and by simulating transitions among dynamically changing free-energy landscapes using the Monte Carlo method. The results obtained by this combined multi-scale calculation show that myosin with inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ADP weakly binds to actin and that after releasing Pi and ADP, myosin moves along the actin filament toward the strong-binding site by exhibiting the biased Brownian motion, a behavior consistent with the observed single-molecular behavior of myosin. Conformational flexibility of loops at the actin-interface of myosin and the N-terminus of actin subunit is necessary for the distinct bias in the Brownian motion. Both the 5.5-11 nm displacement due to the biased Brownian motion and the 3-5 nm displacement due to lever-arm swing contribute to the net displacement of myosin. The calculated results further suggest that the recovery stroke of the lever arm plays an important role in enhancing the displacement of myosin through multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis, suggesting a unified movement mechanism for various members of the myosin family.	arm architecture;actins;adenosine diphosphate;assumed;brownian motion;cerebrovascular accident;cytoskeletal filaments;displacement mapping;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;exhibits as topic;experiment;interaction;microfilaments;molecular dynamics;monte carlo method;myosin atpase;numerous;phosphate measurement;psychologic displacement;simulation;usb on-the-go;actomyosin location;inorganic phosphate;physical hard work	Qing-Miao Nie;Akio Togashi;Takeshi N.

Although various methods for detecting SVs have been developed, the global structure of chromosomes, i.e., how segments in a reference genome are extracted and ordered in an unknown target genome, cannot be inferred by detecting only individual SVs. Here, we formulate the problem of inferring the global structure of chromosomes from SVs as an optimization problem on a bidirected graph. This problem takes into account the aberrant adjacencies of genomic regions, the copy numbers, and the number and length of chromosomes. Although the problem is NP-complete, we propose its polynomial-time solvable variation by restricting instances of the problem using a biologically meaningful condition, which we call the weakly connected constraint. We also explain how to obtain experimental data that satisfies the weakly connected constraint. Our results establish a theoretical foundation for the development of practical computational tools that could be used to infer the global structure of chromosomes based on SVs. The computational complexity of the inference can be reduced by detecting the segments of the reference genome at the ends of the chromosomes of the target genome and also the segments that are known to exist in the target genome.

To study mechanisms responsible for this down-regulation, we have analyzed the promoter of the human reelin gene. We show that the reelin promoter directs expression of a reporter construct in multiple human cell types: neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y), neuronal precursor cells (NT2), differentiated neurons (hNT) and hepatoma cells (HepG2). Deletion constructs confirmed the presence of multiple elements regulating Reln expression, although the promoter activity is promiscuous, i.e. activity did not correlate with expression of the endogenous gene as reflected in terms of reelin mRNA levels. Co-transfection of the -514 bp human reelin promoter with either Sp1 or Tbr1 demonstrated that these transcription factors activate reporter expression by 6- and 8.5-fold, respectively. Within 400 bp of the RNA start site there are 100 potential CpG targets for DNA methylation. Retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of NT2 cells to hNT neurons was accompanied by increased reelin expression and by the appearance of three DNase I hypersensitive sites 5' to the RNA start site. RA-induced differentiation was also associated with demethylation of the reelin promoter. To test if methylation silenced reelin expression, we methylated the promoter in vitro prior to transfection. In addition, we treated NT2 cells with the methylation inhibitor aza-2'-deoxycytidine and observed a 60-fold increase in reelin mRNA levels. The histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid also induced expression of the endogenous reelin promoter, although TSA was considerably more potent. These findings indicate that one determinant responsible for regulating reelin expression is the methylation status of the promoter. Our data also raise the interesting possibility that the down-regulation of reelin expression documented in psychiatric patients might be the consequence of inappropriate promoter hypermethylation.	activation action;bipolar disorder;deoxyribonuclease i;document completion status - documented;down-regulation;histone deacetylase inhibitor;histones;hypersensitivity;mental disorders;patients;protein methylation;psychotic disorders;reln gene;rna;schizophrenia;transcription factor;thioctic acid;transcription (software);valproic acid;cell type;study of epigenetics;trichostatin a	Ying Chen;Rajiv P.

However, the gene(s) comprising the QTL (QTG) are largely unknown. In previous work, Bennett and colleagues created congenic strains carrying the DBA/2IBG (D2) region for alcohol preference (AP) on chromosome 2, on a C57BL/6IBG (B6) background [1]. Subsequently, interval specific congenic recombinant strains (ISCRS), in which the full D2 QTL region was broken into smaller, partially overlapping regions of introgression, were generated and tested. With information from two ISCRS, the QTL has been mapped onto mouse chromosome 2 (Chr2) in a region of 3.4Mb by using C57BL/6J (B6) x DBA/2J (D2) recombinant inbred (RI) strains as well as by using F2 populations. Several candidate genes, Gad1, Atp5g3, Atf2, Sp3 and Sp9, have been evaluated but none of them has been confirmed for a definitive role in the regulation of the QTL of AP on Chr2 [2,3].	causality;channelrhodopsin;population;preference learning;recombinant dna	Lishi Wang;Yan Jiao;Yue Huang;Beth Bennett;Robert W.

A crucial part of the problem concerns the geometrical specificity in side chain association leading to densely packed protein cores, a hallmark of correctly folded native structures. Thus, any model of packing within proteins should constitute an indispensable component of protein folding and design. In this study an attempt has been made to find, characterize and classify recurring patterns in the packing of side chain atoms within a protein which sustains its native fold. The interaction of side chain atoms within the protein core has been represented as a contact network based on the surface complementarity and overlap between associating side chain surfaces. Some network topologies definitely appear to be preferred and they have been termed 'packing motifs', analogous to super secondary structures in proteins. Study of the distribution of these motifs reveals the ubiquitous presence of typical smaller graphs, which appear to get linked or coalesce to give larger graphs, reminiscent of the nucleation-condensation model in protein folding. One such frequently occurring motif, also envisaged as the unit of clustering, the three residue clique was invariably found in regions of dense packing. Finally, topological measures based on surface contact networks appeared to be effective in discriminating sequences native to a specific fold amongst a set of decoys. Out of innumerable topological possibilities, only a finite number of specific packing motifs are actually realized in proteins. This small number of motifs could serve as a basis set in the construction of larger networks. Of these, the triplet clique exhibits distinct preference both in terms of composition and geometry.	basis set (chemistry);cluster analysis;complementarity theory;exhibits as topic;genetic code;graph - visual representation;large;motif;network topology;null (sql);pack unit;packing dimension;protein component;sensitivity and specificity;set packing;staphylococcal protein a;triplet state;protein folding;statistical cluster	Sankar Basu;Dhananjay Bhattacharyya;Rahul Banerjee	2010		10.1186/1471-2105-12-195	protein folding;biology;three-dimensional space;dna microarray;bioinformatics;microtubule-associated protein;genetics;network topology;protein secondary structure	Comp.	8.370241136370169	-59.53981604032336	174921

However, previous analyses have not discussed the effects of environmental factors (i.e., exogenous forces) in shaping network structures. In this work, we investigate the effect of temperature, which is one of the environmental factors that may have contributed to shaping structures of metabolic networks. For this, we investigate the correlations between several structural properties characterized by graph metrics like the edge density, the degree exponent, the clustering coefficient, and the subgraph concentration in the metabolic networks of 113 prokaryotes and optimal growth temperature. As a result, we find that these structural properties are correlated with the optimal growth temperature. With increasing temperature, the edge density, the clustering coefficient and the subgraph concentration decrease and the degree exponent becomes large. This result implies that the metabolic networks transit with temperature as follows. The density of chemical reactions becomes low, the connectivity of the networks becomes homogeneous such as random networks and both the network modularity, based on the graph-theoretic clustering coefficient, and the frequency of recurring subgraphs decay. In short, metabolic networks undergo a change from heterogeneous and high-modular structures to homogeneous and low-modular structures, such as random networks, with temperature. This finding may suggest that the temperature plays an important role in the design principles of metabolic networks.	clustering coefficient;flow network;genetic heterogeneity;graph - visual representation;graph theory;prokaryote;traffic shaping;statistical cluster	Kazuhiro Takemoto;Jose C.

8b3f8e313f98f7fb946b9a5b673a6fae2f78e7c1	the interfacial character of antibody paratopes: analysis of antibody-antigen structures		Summary In this study, computational methods are applied to investigate the general properties of antigen engaging residues of a paratope from a non-redundant dataset of 403 antibody-antigen complexes to dissect the contribution of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, van der Waals contacts and ionic interactions, as well as role of water molecules in the antigen-antibody interface. Consistent with previous reports using smaller datasets, we found that Tyr, Trp, Ser, Asn, Asp, Thr, Arg, Gly, His contribute substantially to the interactions between antibody and antigen. Furthermore, antibody-antigen interactions can be mediated by interfacial waters. However, there is no reported comprehensive analysis for a large number of structured waters that engage in higher ordered structures at the antibody-antigen interface. From our dataset, we have found the presence of interfacial waters in 242 complexes. We present evidence that suggests a compelling role of these interfacial waters in interactions of antibodies with a range of antigens differing in shape complementarity. Finally, we carry out 296 835 pairwise 3D structure comparisons of 771 structures of contact residues of antibodies with their interfacial water molecules from our dataset using CLICK method. A heuristic clustering algorithm is used to obtain unique structural similarities, and found to separate into 368 different clusters. These clusters are used to identify structural motifs of contact residues of antibodies for epitope binding.

With the increasing number of known PTM sites, it becomes imperative to understand their functional interplays. In this study, we proposed a novel analytical strategy to explore functional relationships between PTM sites by testing their tendency to be modified together (co-occurrence) under the same condition, and applied it to proteome-wide human phosphorylation data collected under 88 different laboratory or physiological conditions. Co-occurring phosphorylation occurs significantly more frequently than randomly expected and include many known examples of cross-talk or functional connections. Such pairs, either within the same phosphoprotein or between interacting partners, are more likely to be in sequence or structural proximity, be phosphorylated by the same kinases, participate in similar biological processes, and show residue co-evolution across vertebrates. In addition, we also found that their co-occurrence states tend to be conserved in orthologous phosphosites in the mouse proteome. Together, our results support that the co-occurring phosphorylation are functionally associated. Comparison with existing methods further suggests that co-occurrence analysis can be a useful complement to uncover novel functional associations between PTM sites.	complement system proteins;cross-talk;genetic translation process;homology (biology);imperative programming;interaction;mental association;phentolamine;phosphoproteins;polynomial texture mapping;post-translational protein processing;protein phosphorylation;proteome;randomness;sequence homology;vertebrates	Ying Li;Xueya Zhou;Zichao Zhai;Tingting Li	2017		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005502	phosphorylation;biology;molecular biology;bioinformatics;proteome;permutation;genetics	Comp.	4.070872953306144	-60.60464068541776	175390

Integrated analysis of the resulting omic data sets has proved to be hard to achieve. Metabolic network reconstructions enable complex relationships amongst molecular components to be represented formally in a biologically relevant manner while respecting physical constraints. In silico models derived from such reconstructions can then be queried or interrogated through mathematical simulations. Proteomic profiling studies of the mature human erythrocyte have shown more proteins present related to metabolic function than previously thought; however the significance and the causal consequences of these findings have not been explored. Erythrocyte proteomic data was used to reconstruct the most expansive description of erythrocyte metabolism to date, following extensive manual curation, assessment of the literature, and functional testing. The reconstruction contains 281 enzymes representing functions from glycolysis to cofactor and amino acid metabolism. Such a comprehensive view of erythrocyte metabolism implicates the erythrocyte as a potential biomarker for different diseases as well as a 'cell-based' drug-screening tool. The analysis shows that 94 erythrocyte enzymes are implicated in morbid single nucleotide polymorphisms, representing 142 pathologies. In addition, over 230 FDA-approved and experimental pharmaceuticals have enzymatic targets in the erythrocyte. The advancement of proteomic technologies and increased generation of high-throughput proteomic data have created the need for a means to analyze these data in a coherent manner. Network reconstructions provide a systematic means to integrate and analyze proteomic data in a biologically meaning manner. Analysis of the red cell proteome has revealed an unexpected level of complexity in the functional capabilities of human erythrocyte metabolism.	amino acids;biological markers;causality;coherence (physics);computer simulation;digital curation;dosage forms;emergence;erythrocytes;functional testing;glycolysis;high-throughput computing;internet architecture board;mathematical model;mathematics;metabolic process, cellular;metabolite;nucleotides;protein profiling chips;proteome;proteomics;single nucleotide polymorphism;systems biology;throughput;amino acid metabolism;chemical cofactor	Aarash Bordbar;Neema Jamshidi;Bernhard O.

In this work, the effect of pressure on the conformation and dynamics of HIV-pr was studied in silico at 1 bar (0.987 atm) and 3 Kbar pressure conditions. It can be seen from the literature that protein containing significant number of hydrophobic residues would expose its hydrophobic groups to the solvent exposed area under high pressure conditions, which eventually changes the dynamics and hence conformation of the protein. From our observations, the dynamics studies showed that, although the collective dynamics is restricted under pressure this is not true for some specific residues. From the secondary structure analysis it was observed that turns and bends are favored under high pressure at the expense of ¿-helices and ß-sheets resulting in the reduction of structural variability. Solvent accessible surface (SAS) area of both the low and high pressure simulations showed significant differences. It was also observed that with the elevation in pressure, the hydrophobic effect is decreased. All these conformational changes at high pressure condition may have a special impact on the binding affinity of drugs to the active site region, which may have a direct/indirect effect on the drug resistance behavior of HIV-pr.	accessible surface area;internet backbone;molecular dynamics;processor affinity;sas;simulation;spatial variability	Biswa Ranjan Meher;Mattaparthi Venkata Satish Kumar;K.

We analyze local instability properties of large-scale cyclic gene regulatory networks based on the result which shows that local instability of an equilibrium point globally guarantees the existence of periodic oscillations. The developed criterion has the following distinctive features: (i) it is applicable to cyclic gene regulatory networks consisting of any number of genes, (ii) the dependence of an equilibrium state on biochemical parameters is explicitly considered, and (iii) it depends only on the given biochemical parameters. Thus, the derived condition can explicitly show how each parameter affects the existence of periodic oscillations. Furthermore, it provides us with novel biological insight on decisive physical quantities for the existence of periodic oscillations, and their quantitative relations with periodic oscillations.	broadcast delay;complex network;dynamical system;eisenstein's criterion;gene regulatory network;instability;neural oscillation;repressilator;transcription (software)	Yutaka Hori;Shinji Hara;Tae-Hyoung Kim	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611167	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	7.462108533914111	-65.54571304363725	176890

We are interested to search for its variability by using information content as a measure. We note in this study that the variability is significant in the block of 5 nucleotides (nt) surrounding the TSS region compared with the block of 15 nt. This suggests that the actual region that may be involved is in the range of 5-10 nt in size. For Escherichia coli, we note that the information content from dinucleotide substitution matrices clearly shows a better discrimination, suggesting the presence of some correlations. However, for human this effect is much less, and for mouse it is practically absent. We can conclude that the presence of short-range correlations within the TSS region is species-dependent and is not universal. We further observe that there are other variable regions in the mitochondrial control element apart from TSS. It is also noted that effective comparisons can only be made on blocks, while single nucleotide comparisons do not give us any detectable signals.	dinucleoside phosphates;google sites;heart rate variability;medical transcription;mutual information;nucleotides;self-information;spatial variability;substitution matrix;toxic shock syndrome;transcription (software);transcription initiation site	Ashok Reddy Dinasarapu;Chanchal K.

This is essential for understanding the complexity of human health, disease susceptibility and pathogenesis for Predictive, Preventive, Personalized and Participatory (P4) system and precision medicine. The delineation of the possible interactions of all genes/proteins in a genome/proteome is a task for which conventional experimental techniques are ill suited. Urgently needed are rapid and inexpensive computational and statistical methods that can identify interacting candidate disease genes or drug targets out of thousands that can be further investigated or validated by experimentations. Moreover, identifying biological dynamic systems, and simultaneously estimating the important kinetic structural and functional parameters, which may not be experimentally accessible could be important directions for drug-disease-gene network studies. In this article, we present an overview and comparison of recent developments of dynamic modeling and network approaches for time-course omics data, and their applications to various biological systems, health conditions and disease statuses. Moreover, various data reduction and analytical schemes ranging from mathematical to computational to statistical methods are compared including their merits, drawbacks and limitations. The most recent software, associated web resources and other potentials for the compared methods are also presented and discussed in detail.	biological system;computation;design of experiments;disease susceptibility;drug delivery systems;dynamical system;entity;estimated;experiment;gene regulatory network;high-throughput computing;interaction;kinetics;mathematics;omics;p-code machine;precision medicine;proteome;systems biology;throughput;web resource	Yulan Liang;Arpad Kelemen	2018	Briefings in bioinformatics	10.1093/bib/bbx036	computational biology	Comp.	6.535775560199789	-59.368877463993094	177512
63b944caac365822ca2d273d7175e7d0f5e8cbcd	session introduction		Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are an important newly recognized class of proteins that rely on the lack of stable structures, both in vitro and in vivo, for function. Before the computational studies of the late 1990s, the tendency was to believe that IDPs were artifacts, resulting for example from denaturation during isolation or from the loss of critical factors such as metal ions or small molecules that were needed for the formation or maintenance of structure. However, the bioinformatics work of the late 1990s showed that most of the IDPs have amino acid compositions distinctly different from the compositions of structured proteins. These studies suggested that, in addition to the concept of “sequence à structure à function” there is another concept of “sequence à disordered ensemble à to function.”	artifact (software development);bioinformatics;computation;video-in video-out	Jianhan Chen;Jianlin Cheng;A.

Based on first principles, here we construct an individual-based, force-based computational model integrating four modules of 1) filopodia penetration dynamics; 2) intracellular mechanics of cellular and nuclear membranes, contractile actin stress fibers, and focal adhesion dynamics; 3) structural mechanics of ECM fiber networks; and 4) reaction-diffusion mass transfers of seven biochemical concentrations in related with chemotaxis, proteolysis, haptotaxis, and degradation in ECM to predict dynamic behaviors of filopodia that penetrate into a 3D ECM fiber network. The tip of each filopodium crawls along ECM fibers, tugs the surrounding fibers, and contracts or retracts depending on the strength of the binding and the ECM stiffness and pore size. This filopodium-ECM interaction is modeled as a stochastic process based on binding kinetics between integrins along the filopodial shaft and the ligands on the surrounding ECM fibers. This filopodia stochastic model is integrated into migratory dynamics of a whole cell in order to predict the cell invasion into 3D ECM in response to chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and durotaxis cues. Predicted average filopodia speed and that of the cell membrane advance agreed with experiments of 3D HUVEC migration at r(2) > 0.95 for diverse ECMs with different pore sizes and stiffness.	chemotaxis;computational model;contract agreement;elegant degradation;experiment;extracellular matrix;focal (programming language);filopodia;focal adhesions;focal adhesion pathway;integrins;interaction;kinetics internet protocol;leukemia, b-cell;ligands;material pore size;mechanics;muscle contraction;nuclear envelope;plasma membrane;shaft device component;stochastic process;stress fibers;tissue fiber	Min-Cheol Kim;Jordan Whisler;Yaron R.

Hyper-phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (hyper-pRb) is found in high levels in ALL cells. Nevertheless, the ALL lymphocyte proliferation rate for the average patient is surprisingly low compared to its normal counterpart of the same maturation level. Additionally, as stated in literature, ALL cells possibly reside at or beyond the RP which is located in the late-G1 phase. This state may favor their differentiation resistant phenotype. A major phenomenon contributing to this fact is thought to be the observed limited redundancy in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by the various Cyclin Dependent Kinases (Cdks). The latter may result in partial loss of pRb functions despite hyper-phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, an in silico model aiming at simulating the biochemical regulation of the RP in ALL is introduced. By exploiting experimental findings derived from leukemic cells and following a semi-quantitative calibration procedure, the model has been shown to satisfactorily reproduce such a behavior for the RP pathway. At the same time, the calibrated model has been proved to be in agreement with the observed variation in the ALL cell cycle duration. The proposed model aims to contribute to a better understanding of the complex phenomena governing the leukemic cell cycle. At the same time it constitutes a significant first step in the creation of a personalized proliferation rate predictor that can be used in the context of multiscale cancer modeling. Such an approach is expected to play an important role in the refinement and the advancement of mechanistic modeling of ALL in the context of the emergent and promising scientific domains of In Silico Oncology and more generally In Silico Medicine.	anatomical maturation;cell differentiation process;cellular phone;contribution;cyclin-dependent kinases;cyclins;deregulation;emergence;gene regulatory network;hyper-heuristic;hyperactive behavior;in silico medicine;kerrison predictor;leukemic cell;neoplasms;patients;personalization;precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma;rp (complexity);refinement (computing);reifenstein syndrome;retinoblastoma protein;semiconductor industry;simulation;lymphoblast;lymphocyte proliferation	Eleftherios N.

Viral infections spread in many ways, but often have devastating consequences and represent a huge danger for public health. It is important to design statistical and computational techniques capable of handling the available data and highlighting the most important features.   METHODS This paper reviews the quantitative and qualitative behaviour of 22 infectious diseases caused by viruses. The information is compared and visualized by means of the multidimensional scaling technique.   RESULTS The results are robust to uncertainties in the data and revealed to be consistent with clinical practice.

In this paper we introduce a mathematical algorithm and a coding system for rapid computational construction of metabolic networks. The initial data for the algorithm are the source substrate code and the enzyme/metabolite interaction tables. The major strength of the algorithm is the adaptive coding system of the enzyme-substrate interactions. A reverse application of the algorithm is also possible, when optimisation algorithm is used to compute the enzyme/metabolite rules from the reference network structure. The coding system is user-defined and must be adapted to the studied problem. The algorithm is most effective for computation of networks that consist of metabolites with similar molecular structures. The computation of the cholesterol biosynthesis metabolic network suggests that 89 intermediates can theoretically be formed between lanosterol and cholesterol, only 20 are presently considered as cholesterol intermediates. Alternative metabolites may represent links with other metabolic networks both as precursors and metabolites of cholesterol. A possible cholesterol-by-pass pathway to bile acids metabolism through cholestanol is suggested.

Many conserved non-enzymatic protein domains have been identified that contribute to the activities of multiprotein remodeling complexes. Here we identified a novel conserved protein domain in Eukaryota whose putative function may be in regulating chromatin remodeling. Since this domain is associated with a known SANT domain in several vertebrate proteins, we named it the SANTA (SANT Associated) domain. Sequence analysis showed that the SANTA domain is approximately a 90 amino acid module and likely composed of four central beta-sheets and three flanking alpha-helices. Many hydrophobic residues exhibited high conservation along the domain, implying a possible function in protein-protein interactions. The SANTA domain was identified in mammals, chicken, frog, fish, sea squirt, sea urchin, worms and plants. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree of SANTA domains showed that one plant-specific duplication event happened in the Viridiplantae lineage.	accessibility;amino acids;anura;chickens;chromatin structure;eukaryota;flank (surface region);gene duplication abnormality;lineage (evolution);mammals;name;occur (action);phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;protein domain;sea urchin (invertebrate);sequence analysis;transcription (software);transcription, genetic;urochordata;viridiplantae;chromatin remodeling;protein protein interaction	Dapeng Zhang;Christopher J.

We found remarkable differences in protein length, exon structure, and domain count among different phylogenetic lineages. While eukaryotic proteins have an average size of 472 amino acid residues (aa), average protein sizes in plant genomes are smaller than those of animals and fungi. Proteins unique to plants are ∼81aa shorter than plant proteins conserved among other eukaryotic lineages. The smaller average size of plant proteins could neither be explained by endosymbiosis nor subcellular compartmentation nor exon size, but rather due to exon number. Metazoan proteins are encoded on average by ∼10 exons of small size [∼176 nucleotides (nt)]. Streptophyta have on average only ∼5.7 exons of medium size (∼230nt). Multicellular species code for large proteins by increasing the exon number, while most unicellular organisms employ rather larger exons (>400nt). Among subcellular compartments, membrane proteins are the largest (∼520aa), whereas the smallest proteins correspond to the gene ontology group of ribosome (∼240aa). Plant genes are encoded by half the number of exons and also contain fewer domains than animal proteins on average. Interestingly, endosymbiotic proteins that migrated to the plant nucleus became larger than their cyanobacterial orthologs. We thus conclude that plants have proteins larger than bacteria but smaller than animals or fungi. Compared to the average of eukaryotic species, plants have ∼34% more but ∼20% smaller proteins. This suggests that photosynthetic organisms are unique and deserve therefore special attention with regard to the evolutionary forces acting on their genomes and proteomes.	amino acids;anatomical compartments;cell nucleus;exons;fungi;gene ontology;genome;genome, plant;homology (biology);large;largest;membrane proteins;microorganism;nucleotides;phylogenetics;plant physiological phenomena;plant proteins;proteome;pseudo amino acid composition;ribosomes;small;species code	Obed Ramírez-Sánchez;Paulino Pérez-Rodríguez;Luis Delaye;Axel Tiessen	2016		10.1016/j.gpb.2016.06.003	biology;bioinformatics;evolution;genetics	Comp.	4.351885492243036	-62.2235422717993	179583

In cardiac tissues, CYP2J2 can adopt arachidonic acid as a major substrate to produce epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which can protect endothelial cells from ischemic or hypoxic injuries and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and hypertension. However, some CYP2J2 polymorphisms, i.e., T143A and N404Y, significantly reduce the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Lacking experimental structural data for CYP2J2, the detailed mechanism for the mutation-induced dysfunction in the metabolism of arachidonic acid is still unknown. In the current study, three-dimensional structural models of the wild-type CYP2J2 and two mutants (T143A and N404Y) were constructed by a coordinate reconstruction approach and ab initio modeling using CYP2R1 as a template. The structural analysis of the computational models showed that the wild-type CYP2J2 exhibited a typical CYP fold with 12 alpha-helices and three beta-sheets on one side and with the heme group buried deeply inside the core. Due to the small and hydrophobic side-chain, T143A mutation could destabilize the C helix, further placing the water access channel in a closed state to prevent the escape of the produced water molecules during the catalytic processes. N404Y mutation could reposition the side-chain of Leu(378), making it no longer form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of arachidonic acid. However, this hydrogen bond was essential for substrate recognition and positioning in a correct orientation.	arachidonic acid;arteriopathic disease;boerdijk–coxeter helix;carboxyl group;clinical use template;computation;computational model;coronary artery disease;de novo protein structure prediction;endothelial cells;epoxyeicosatrienoic acid;fatty acids;fatty acids, essential;fatty acids, omega-6;heme;hydrogen bonding;hypertensive disease;hypoxia;mutation;structural analysis;mutant	Shan Cong;Xiao-Tu Ma;Yixue Li;Jing-Fang Wang	2013	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci400003p	cyp2j2;mutant;arachidonic acid;metabolism;pathogenesis;essential fatty acid;mutation;cyp2c8;biochemistry;biology	SE	8.499812433348998	-62.56958656992444	179795

The elementary processes involved in template biopolymerization, such as mRNA and protein synthesis, introduce significant time delays. However, there is not currently a systematic mapping between the individual mechanistic parameters and the time delays in these networks. We present here the development of mathematical, time-delay models for protein translation, based on PDE models, which in turn are derived through systematic approximations of first-principles mechanistic models. Theoretical analysis suggests that the key features that determine the time-delays and the agreement between the time-delay and the mechanistic models are ribosome density and distribution, i.e., the number of ribosomes on the mRNA chain relative to their maximum and their distribution along the mRNA chain. Based on analytical considerations and on computational studies, we show that the steady-state and dynamic responses of the time-delay models are in excellent agreement with the detailed mechanistic models, under physiological conditions that correspond to uniform ribosome distribution and for ribosome density up to 70%. The methodology presented here can be used for the development of reduced time-delay models of mRNA synthesis and large genetic networks. The good agreement between the time-delay and the mechanistic models will allow us to use the reduced model and advanced computational methods from nonlinear dynamics in order to perform studies that are not practical using the large-scale mechanistic models.	approximation;biological system;clinical use template;computation;gene regulatory network;mathematics;national origin;nonlinear system;ribosomes;steady state;translation initiation	Luis Mier-y-Teran-Romero;Mary Silber;Vassily Hatzimanikatis	2010		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000726	computer simulation;biology;molecular biology;bioinformatics;genetics;protein biosynthesis	Comp.	7.656331684033051	-65.41399268199882	179830

At short time one observes a drift of the bacterial population, while at long time one observes accumulation in high-nutrient regions. Recent work has viewed chemotaxis as a compromise between drift toward favorable regions and accumulation in favorable regions. A number of earlier studies assume that a bacterium resets its memory at tumbles - a fact not borne out by experiment - and make use of approximate coarse-grained descriptions. Here, we revisit the problem of chemotaxis without resorting to any memory resets. We find that when bacteria respond to the environment in a non-adaptive manner, chemotaxis is generally dominated by diffusion, whereas when bacteria respond in an adaptive manner, chemotaxis is dominated by a bias in the motion. In the adaptive case, favorable drift occurs together with favorable accumulation. We derive our results from detailed simulations and a variety of analytical arguments. In particular, we introduce a new coarse-grained description of chemotaxis as biased diffusion, and we discuss the way it departs from older coarse-grained descriptions.	approximation algorithm;chemotaxis;description;escherichia coli;simulation;tree accumulation	Sakuntala Chatterjee;Rava Azeredo da Silveira;Yariv Kafri	2011		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002283	computer simulation;biology;simulation;statistical mechanics;diffusion;escherichia coli;chemotaxis;ecology;genetics	ML	6.4273051429922345	-64.78899308013212	180078
635c000e5f248fb3e6f5abaa80906fe91876797d	sub-class differences of ph-dependent hiv gp120-cd4 interactions		Research in the field of HIV transmission has yet to provide a vaccine for this imponderable virus. Though progress has been made to extend the life of those chronically infected, a solution to the transmission of the disease remains elusive. Previous studies involving electrostatic surface charge analysis revealed the sensitivity of gp120 envelope (Env) protein function to changes in pH across levels consistent with those found in the human body. A prototype computational approach was developed and found to agree with these results. A refined process was developed capable of classifying Env sequences/structures through machine learning techniques. We expound this analytical procedure to encompass residue-level analysis and include minimization steps to ensure the integrity of the protein models. Additionally, the process has been enhanced with advanced data compression techniques to allow for more in-depth analysis of the systems. In this research we explore a new technique termed electrostatic variance masking (EVM), that reveals what we hypothesize to be the mechanistic residues responsible for the pH sensitivity of Env binding site. The data implies that a conserved set of core residues may be responsible for modulation of the binding process in varying environmental conditions mainly involving pH.	computation;data compression;env;interaction;machine learning;modulation;prototype;unsharp masking	Scott P.

42e5d451fa44427f8c77ea00b83fa028ff769938	conformational studies of immunodominant myelin basic protein 1-11 analogues using nmr and molecular modeling		Τwo dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies complimented by molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the conformation of the immunodominant epitope of acetylated myelin basic protein residues 1-11 (Ac-MBP(1-11)) and its altered peptide ligands, mutated at position 4 to an alanine (Ac-MBP(1-11)[4A]) or a tyrosine residue (Ac-MBP(1-11)[4Y]). Conformational analysis of the three analogues indicated that they adopt an extended conformation in DMSO solution as no long distance NOE connectivities were observed and seem to have a similar conformation when bound to the active site of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC II). The interaction of each peptide with MHC class II I-A(u) was further investigated in order to explore the molecular mechanism of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induction/inhibition in mice. The present findings indicate that the Gln(3) residue, which serves as a T-cell receptor (TCR) contact site in the TCR/peptide/I-A(u) complex, has a different orientation in the mutated analogues especially in the Ac-MBP(1-11)[4A] peptide. In particular the side chain of Gln(3) is not solvent exposed as for the native Ac-MBP(1-11) and it is not available for interaction with the TCR.		Despina Laimou;Eliada Lazoura;Anastassios N.

This probabilistic process selects for cells within a range of responsiveness that allows the detection of foreign antigen without excessive responses to self. Regulatory T cells are thought to lie at the higher end of the spectrum of acceptable self-reactivity and play a crucial role in the control of autoimmunity and tolerance to innocuous antigens. While many studies have elucidated key elements influencing lineage commitment, we still lack a full understanding of how thymocytes integrate signals obtained by sampling self-peptides to make fate decisions. To address this problem, we apply stochastic models of signal integration by T cells to data from a study quantifying the development of the two lineages using controllable levels of agonist peptide in the thymus. We find two models are able to explain the observations; one in which T cells continually re-assess fate decisions on the basis of multiple summed proximal signals from TCR-pMHC interactions; and another in which TCR sensitivity is modulated over time, such that contact with the same pMHC ligand may lead to divergent outcomes at different stages of development. Neither model requires that T(conv) and T(reg) are differentially susceptible to deletion or that the two lineages need qualitatively different signals for development, as have been proposed. We find additional support for the variable-sensitivity model, which is able to explain apparently paradoxical observations regarding the effect of partial and strong agonists on T(conv) and T(reg) development.	autoimmune diseases;deletion mutation;genetic selection;hawthorn leaf with flower extract;interaction;ligands;lineage (evolution);major histocompatibility complex;model of hierarchical complexity;modulation;peptide microarray;peptide/mhc complex;responsiveness;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;stochastic process;thymic tissue;transmission control room;thymocyte	Iren Bains;Hisse M. van Santen;Benedict Seddon;Andrew J.

Here, we introduce a novel, machine-learning based classification methodology, which we call perturbation expectation-maximization (pEM), that simultaneously analyzes a population of protein trajectories to uncover the system of diffusive behaviors which collectively result from distinct biochemical interactions. We validate the performance of pEM in silico and demonstrate that pEM is capable of uncovering the proper number of underlying diffusive states with an accurate characterization of their diffusion properties. We then apply pEM to experimental protein trajectories of Rho GTPases, an integral regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular homeostasis, in vivo via single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy. Remarkably, pEM uncovers 6 distinct diffusive states conserved across various Rho GTPase family members. The variability across family members in the propensities for each diffusive state reveals non-redundant roles in the activation states of RhoA and RhoC. In a resting cell, our results support a model where RhoA is constantly cycling between activation states, with an imbalance of rates favoring an inactive state. RhoC, on the other hand, remains predominantly inactive.	cytoskeleton;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;guanosine triphosphate phosphohydrolases;interaction;interphase cell;machine learning;photoactivated localization microscopy;physical inactivity;rhoc gene;spatial variability;video-in video-out;cellular homeostasis;rhoa gtp-binding protein	Peter K.

In this study, the selection pressure on HA of H5N1 influenza A virus was analyzed using bioinformatics algorithms. Most of the identified positive selection (PS) sites were found to be within or adjacent to epitope sites. Some of the identified PS sites are consistent with previous experimental studies, providing further support to the biological significance of our findings. The highest frequency of PS sites was observed in recent strains isolated during 2005-2007. Phylogenetic analysis was also conducted on HA sequences from various hosts. Viral drift is almost similar in both avian and human species with a progressive trend over the years. Our study reports new mutations in functional regions of HA that might provide markers for vaccine design or can be used to predict isolates of pandemic potential.	antigenic variation;aves;bioinformatics;biological evolution;hemagglutinin;immune system;influenza a virus;influenza in birds;membrane glycoproteins;murine sarcoma viruses;mutation;phylogenetics;positive selection;algorithm	Venkata R.

HDACs involved in growth, development and response to stresses in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana histone deacetylase 14 (AtHDA14) is found to localize in the mitochondria and chloroplasts, and it involved in photosynthesis and melatonin biosynthesis. However, its mechanism of action was still unknowns so far. Therefore, in this study, we constructed AtHDA14 protein model using homology modeling method, validated using PROCHECK and presented using Ramachandran plots. We also performed virtual screening of AtHDA14 by docking with small molecule drugs and predicted their ADMET properties to select representative inhibitors. MD simulation for representative AtHDA14-ligand complexes was carried out to further research and reveal their stability and inhibition mechanism. Meanwhile, MM/PBSA method was utilized to obtain more valuable information about the residues energy contribution. Moreover, compared with four candidate inhibitors, we also found that compound 645533 and 6918837 might be a more potent AtHDA14 inhibitor than TSA (444732) and SAHA (5311). Therefore, compound 6445533 and 6918837 was anticipated to be a promising drug candidate for inhibition of AtHDA14.	acetylation;alignment;anabolism;boat dock;chloroplasts;deacetylation;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;epigenetic process;histone deacetylase;histones;homology (biology);homology modeling;ip address blocking;lysine;melatonin;molecular dynamics;numerical weather prediction;photosynthesis;plant development;processor affinity;qm/mm;recurrence plot;serotonin uptake inhibitors;simulation;small molecule;virtual screening;vorinostat;indole-3-glycerol-phosphate lyase activity;melatonin biosynthetic process;study of epigenetics;zinc ion binding	Minglang Zhao;Wang Wang;Hu Nie;Sha-Sha Cao;Lin-Fang Du	2018	Computational biology and chemistry	10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2018.05.006	docking (dog);genetics;small molecule;virtual screening;acetylation;histone deacetylase;in silico;homology modeling;histone;biochemistry;biology	Comp.	9.25302050339114	-61.314558724162076	181867

The method, which we call orthologweighting, assesses the degree to which the predicted binding occupancy of a transcription factor in a reference gene is also predicted in the promoters of orthologous genes. The analysis was performed separately for over 100 different transcription factors in S. cerevisiae. Statistical significance was evaluated by simulation using permuted versions of the position weight matrices. Orthologweighting produced about twice as many significantly high scoring genes as were obtained from the S. cerevisiae genome alone. Gene Ontology analysis found a similar two-fold enrichment of genes. Both analyses suggest that orthologweighting improves the prediction of true regulatory targets. Interestingly, the method has only a marginal effect on the prediction of binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We suggest several possibilities for reconciling this result with the improved enrichment that we observe for functionally related promoters and for promoters that are under positive selection.

Histone modifications or transcription factors frequently act in a multi-functional manner, with a given DNA motif or histone modification conveying both transcriptional repression and activation depending on its location in the promoter and other regulatory signals surrounding it. To account for the possible multi functionality of regulatory signals, we model the observed gene expression patterns by a mixture of linear regression models. We apply the approach to identify the underlying histone modifications and transcription factors guiding gene expression of differentiated CD4+ T cells. The method improves the gene expression prediction in relation to the use of a single linear model, as often used by previous approaches. Moreover, it recovered the known role of the modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in activating cell specific genes and of some transcription factors related to CD4+ T differentiation.	cell differentiation process;gene expression programming;histone code;histone h3 trimethyl lys4;histones;linear model;mixture model;motif;numerous;repression, psychology;stem cells;t cell differentiation;transcription factor;transcription (software);transcription, genetic;transcriptional repression;histone modification	Ivan G.

69d34c93f06858766dea908c81dddd82e3c389a0	a self-referential model for the formation of the genetic code	amino acid;unu;protein stability;genetic code;genetics;protein synthesis	A model for the formation of the genetic code is presented where protein synthesis is directed initially by tRNA dimers. Proteins that are resistant to degradation and efficient RNA-binders protect the RNAs. Replication becomes elongational producing poly-tRNAs from which the mRNAs and ribosomes are derived. Attributions are successively fixed to tRNAs paired through the perfect palindromic anticodons, with the same bases at the extremities (5′ANA: UNU 3′; GNG: CNC; principal dinucleotides, pDiN). The 5′ degeneracy is then developed. The first pairs to be encoded correspond to the hydropathy correlation outliers (Gly-CC: Pro-GG and Ser-GA: Ser-CU) and to the sector of homogeneous pDiN, composed by two pyrimidines or two purines. These amino acids are preferred in the N-ends of proteins, stabilizers of proteins against catabolism and strong RNA-binders. The next pairs complete the sector of homogeneous pDiN (Asp, Glu-UC: Leu-AG and Asn, Lys-UU: Phe-AA). This set of nine amino acids forms the protein cores with the predominant aperiodic conformation. Next enter the pairs with mixed pDiN (one purine and one pyrimidine), the RY attributions composing the protein N-ends and the YR attributions the C-ends. The last pair contains the main punctuation signs (Ile, Met, iMet-AU: Tyr, Stop-UA). The model indicates that genetic information emerged during the process of formation of the coding/decoding system and that genes were defined by the proteins. Stable proteins constructed the nucleoprotein system by binding to the RNAs that produced them. In this circular rationale, genes are memories in a metabolic system for production of proteins that stabilize it. The simplicity and the highly deterministic character of the process suggest that the Last Universal Common Ancestor populations could be composed, in early stages, of lineages bearing similar genetic codes.	amino acids;anticodon;antigens;aperiodic graph;asparagine;aspartate;base;degeneracy (graph theory);design rationale;elegant degradation;gadu-gadu;genetic code;glycine;isoleucine;last universal common ancestor;leucine;limb structure;lysine;metabolic process, cellular;nucleoproteins;phenylalanine;poly a;population;protein biosynthesis;purines;pyrimidines;rna;ribosomes;self-reference;software release life cycle;tip (unix utility);tyrosine;uc browser;unique user;user agent;who/fao/unu;attribution;purine	Romeu Cardoso Guimarães;Carlos Henrique Costa Moreira;Sávio Torres de Farias	2008	Theory in Biosciences	10.1007/s12064-008-0043-y	biology;biochemistry;amino acid;bioinformatics;genetic code;genetics;protein biosynthesis	Comp.	4.5698126297648	-62.649907082184974	183136

N-terminal modifications which disrupted the surface charge network of gamma-crystallin did not produce significant unfolding in any part of the gamma-crystallin molecule (P > 0.05) consistent with the results of in vitro aggregation studies. There were no significant changes to the molecular volume of the protein, suggesting that adduct formation did not result in molten globule formation. Adduct formation did however increase the vulnerability of particular gamma-crystallin cysteine residues to sulphydryl bond formation and so increased the possibility of mixed disulphide formation with glutathione. Modelling of such secondary modification products (containing both N-terminal modifications and glutathione adducts) demonstrated significant (P < 0.05) structural changes. This suggests that a post-translational modification pathway leading to crystallin cross-linking and cataractogenesis proceeds via a number of co-operative steps involving both modification at the N-terminus and mixed glutathione formation.	crystallins;fractal globule;gene regulatory network;genetic translation process;globule dosage form;in vitro [publication type];interferon type ii;lindane;mfge8 protein, human;molecular modelling;post-translational protein processing;review aggregator;simulation;sulfhydryl compounds;unfolding (dsp implementation);adduct;gamma-crystallins;glutathione biosynthetic process;newton	Derek Goode;M.

Aligning multiple biological sequences is a key step in elucidating evolutionary relationships, annotating newly sequenced segments, and understanding the relationship between biological sequences and functions. Classical MSA algorithms are designed to primarily capture conservations in sequences whereas couplings, or correlated mutations, are well known as an additional important aspect of sequence evolution. (Two sequence positions are coupled when mutations in one are accompanied by compensatory mutations in another). As a result, better exposition of couplings is sometimes one of the reasons for hand-tweaking of MSAs by practitioners. ARMiCoRe introduces a distinctly pattern mining approach to improving MSAs: using frequent episode mining as a foundational basis, we define the notion of a coupled pattern and demonstrate how the discovery and tiling of coupled patterns using a max-flow approach can yield MSAs that are better than conservation-based alignments. Although we were motivated to improve MSAs for the sake of better exposing couplings, we demonstrate that our MSAs are also improvements in terms of traditional metrics of assessment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ARMiCoRe on a large collection of data sets.		K. S. M.

5cc36710b7037651fb119f5787af826751507841	the effects of multivalency and kinetics in nanoscale search by molecular spiders		Molecular spiders are nanoscale walkers made with catalytic DNA legs attached to a rigid body. They move over a surface of DNA substrates, cleaving them and leaving behind product DNA strands, which they are able to revisit. The legs cleave and detach from substrates more slowly than they detach from products. This difference in residence time and the presence of multiple legs make a spider move differently from an ordinary random walker. The number of legs, and their lengths, can be varied, and this defines how a spider moves on the surface, i.e., its gait. In this work we define an abstract model of molecular spiders. Using Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, we study how efficiently spiders with various gaits are able to find specific targets on a two-dimensional lattice. Multi-legged spiders with certain gaits can find the targets faster than regular random walkers. The search performance of spiders depends on both their gait and the kinetic rate r describing the relative substrate/product “stickiness”. Spiders with gaits that allow more freedom for leg movements find their targets faster than spiders with more restrictive gaits. For every gait, there is an optimal value of r that minimizes the time to find all target sites.	amiga walker;kinesiology;kinetic monte carlo;monte carlo method;optimization problem;random walker algorithm;simulation	Oleg Semenov;Darko Stefanovic;Milan N.

A recent X-ray and mutagenesis experiment (Chen, et al Nature 2009, 459, 1146) of the AMPK homolog S. Pombe sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1) has proposed a new conformational switch model involving the movement of the kinase domain (KD) between an inactive unphosphorylated open state and an active or semi-active phosphorylated closed state, mediated by the autoinhibitory domain (AID), and a similar mutagenesis study showed that rat AMPK has the same auto-inhibition mechanism. However, there is no direct dynamical evidence to support this model and it is not clear whether other functionally important local structural components are equally inhibited. By using the same SNF1 KD-AID fragment as that used in experiment, we show that AID inhibits the catalytic function by restraining the KD into an unproductive open conformation, thereby limiting local structural rearrangements, while mutations that disrupt the interactions between the KD and AID allow for both the local structural rearrangement and global interlobe conformational transition. Our calculations further show that the AID also greatly impacts the structuring and mobility of the activation loop.	activation function;dna sequence rearrangement;dynamical system;entity–relationship model;homology (biology);interaction;molecular dynamics;mutation;network model;normal mode;physical inactivity;protein kinases;semiconductor industry;simulation;sucrose;x-ray (amazon kindle);non-t, non-b childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia;stress-activated protein kinase 1	Cheng Peng;Teresa Head-Gordon	2011		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002082	mutation;biology;biochemistry;entropy;molecular dynamics;protein kinase domain;normal mode;bioinformatics	AI	9.214180701476499	-64.37544712160759	184254
8a529d3ff6f4886ebefe714963e79d2dc47d69d9	a boolean function for neural induction reveals a critical role of direct intercellular interactions in patterning the ectoderm of the ascidian embryo	embryo nonmammalian;sea squirts;animals;urochordata;signal transduction;blastomeres;models biological;ectoderm;embryos;gene expression;signaling molecules;gene expression regulation developmental;animal signaling and communication;computational biology;cell signaling;body patterning	A complex system of multiple signaling molecules often produce differential gene expression patterns in animal embryos. In the ascidian embryo, four signaling ligands, Ephrin-A.d (Efna.d), Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r, coordinately induce Otx expression in the neural lineage at the 32-cell stage. However, it has not been determined whether differential inputs of all of these signaling pathways are really necessary. It is possible that differential activation of one of these signaling pathways is sufficient and the remaining signaling pathways are activated in all cells at similar levels. To address this question, we developed a parameter-free method for determining a Boolean function for Otx expression in the present study. We treated activities of signaling pathways as Boolean values, and we also took all possible patterns of signaling gradients into consideration. We successfully determined a Boolean function that explains Otx expression in the animal hemisphere of wild-type and morphant embryos at the 32-cell stage. This Boolean function was not inconsistent with three sensing patterns, which represented whether or not individual cells received sufficient amounts of the signaling molecules. These sensing patterns all indicated that differential expression of Otx in the neural lineage is primarily determined by Efna.d, but not by differential inputs of Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r signaling. To confirm this hypothesis experimentally, we simultaneously knocked-down Admp, Gdf1/3-r, and Fgf9/16/20, and treated this triple morphant with recombinant bFGF and BMP4 proteins, which mimic Fgf9/16/20 and Admp/Gdf1/3-r activity, respectively. Although no differential inputs of Admp, Gdf1/3-r and Fgf9/16/20 signaling were expected under this experimental condition, Otx was expressed specifically in the neural lineage. Thus, direct cell-cell interactions through Efna.d play a critical role in patterning the ectoderm of the early ascidian embryo.	5-amino-5-deoxymannopyranoside;boolean;cell signaling;complex system;ectoderm;embryo;ephrins;experiment;gene expression programming;gradient;interaction;ligands;lineage (evolution);population parameter;recombinant dna;tissue-specific gene expression	Naoyuki Ohta;Kana Waki;Atsushi Mochizuki;Yutaka Satou	2015		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004687	biology;biochemistry;cell signaling;genetics;anatomy	Comp.	7.159519717668431	-64.64773547428646	184713

The present study was to investigate the antibacterial compound 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DTBBQ) isolated from marine Streptomyces sp. VITVSK1 as a potent antibacterial agent. The antibacterial potential of DTBBQ was investigated against RNA Polymerase (PDB ID-1I6V) by in silico molecular docking tools. Results of our study showed the high affinity interaction between DTBBQ and RNA polymerase and also confirmed the drug likeliness of DTBBQ using ADMET in silico pharmacology tools.

Such periodicity is usually not observed in introns and intergenic regions. If a DNA sequence is divided into small segments and a Fourier Transform is applied on each segment, a strong peak at frequency 1/3 is typically observed in the Fourier spectrum of coding segments, but not in non-coding regions. This property has been used in identifying the locations of protein-coding genes in unannotated sequence. The method is fast and requires no training. However, the need to compute the Fourier Transform across a segment (window) of arbitrary size affects the accuracy with which one can localize TP boundaries. Here, we report a technique that provides higher-resolution identification of these boundaries, and use the technique to explore the biological correlates of TP regions in the genome of the model organism C. elegans. Using both simulated TP signals and the real C. elegans sequence F56F11 as an example, we demonstrate that, (1) Modified Wavelet Transform (MWT) can better define the boundary of TP region than the conventional Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT); (2) The scale parameter (a) of MWT determines the precision of TP boundary localization: bigger values of a give sharper TP boundaries but result in a lower signal to noise ratio; (3) RNA splicing sites have weaker TP signals than coding region; (4) TP signals in coding region can be destroyed or recovered by frame-shift mutations; (5) 6 bp periodicities in introns and intergenic region can generate false positive signals and it can be removed with 6 bp MWT. MWT can provide more precise TP boundaries than STFT and the boundaries can be further refined by bigger scale MWT. Subtraction of 6 bp periodicity signals reduces the number of false positives. Experimentally-introduced frame-shift mutations help recover TP signal that have been lost by possible ancient frame-shifts. More importantly, TP signal has the potential to be used to detect the splice junctions in fully spliced mRNA sequence.	amino acids;chamaecyparis lawsoniana;codon (nucleotide sequence);dna, complementary;encode;exons;experiment;fourier analysis;greater;introns;mutation;nucleotides;open reading frames;population parameter;quasiperiodicity;rna splicing;short-time fourier transform;signal-to-noise ratio;splice (system call);trinucleotide repeats;triplet state;wavelet transform	Liya Wang;Lincoln Stein	2010		10.1186/1471-2105-11-550	biology;molecular biology;bioinformatics;genetics;complementary dna	Comp.	3.2383500743339755	-62.44399446922968	185077

This permits to increase the cleavage specificity of the restriction enzyme by two-step methylation of the DNA (1), as shown here for the three-component M-Mspl-MFo/d-Fo/d combination, changing Fo/d specificity from 5 to 7 bp. The cleavage specificity of Fo/d is 5'-GGATG(N)9/13 (2). MFokl methylates only one strand of the recognition site, resulting in GGmATG sequence (3). Msp\ and Fold sites can overlap in the 7-bp sequence CCGGATG or in the 8-bp sequence CCGGGATG. Methylation of such sites by MMsp\ (methylation specificity: mCCGG)produces non-cognate methylation of the overlapping Fo/d sites, resulting in (a) STST' IB o r () m8SrIB sequences, respectively. We show here that in case (a), MFo/d is inhibited and Fok\ is unaffected (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 2, respectively), while in case (b), MFo/cl is unaffected and Fo/d is partially inhibited (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 5, respectively, where MHpati was used to produce the (b) type non-cognate methylation of Fo/d sites on the same 7-bp sequences). As the result, when the DNA is premethylated by M-Msp\, MFo/d cannot methylate those 7-bp CCGGATG sequences (which thus remain susceptible to Fo/d), whereas all other Fo/d sites would be methylated and thus protected from Fold cleavage. However, cleavage by Fo/d at the CCGGATG sites may not be complete (max. 90%), because MFo/d has some residual affinity to the sites premethylated by M-Mspl, especially when excess M-Fo/d is used (data not shown). Nevertheless, in many cases this does not affect the applicability of the system.	base pairing;dna restriction enzymes;emoticon;fo (complexity);fold (higher-order function);license;methylation;methyltransferase;nucleotides;offset binary;processor affinity;sensitivity and specificity;strand (programming language);methylate	G.

d55ce588a611ef2dc11f9c114533b9436902d497	spatial structure creates community-level selection for nutrient recycling		Nutrient cycling is a ubiquitous feature of ecosystems at all scales, allowing productivity to rise beyond the limits set by external nutrient inputs. Nutrient cycling occurs as a side-effect of the metabolism of a diverse set of species that each performs a step in the recycling loop. Recycling loops can be large and involve many steps. At each step the possibility exists for ‘side-reactions’ in the form of species with metabolisms that consume an intermediate metabolite but do not create the product needed to complete the recycling loop. Also, at least some of the biochemical reactions in any closed recycling loop must be endergonic (energyconsuming) and thus recycling loops may be vulnerable to invasion or parasitism by species that consume intermediates but do not produce costly products needed to close the loop. The possibility of such destabilising side-reactions appears to conflict with the apparent stability and ubiquity of nutrient recycling in nature.	computer recycling;ecosystem;nutrient cycle	Hywel T.

Itemising properties of protein sequences is informative, so is the list of ingredients to do some cooking, but without a recipe, that is, quantification and chronology, understanding is incomplete. If the goal of accumulating information is to discover or reveal the function and related biochemical mechanisms, information has to be weighed and ordered. As a guideline, the weight of a piece of information should reflect how often it consistently occurs in various contexts. We propose a common sense approach to quantify and put data and information into perspective. Complete bacterial proteomes are individually mapped with the Pfam-A database of domains and protein family signatures in an attempt to assess the modularity of proteins at the level of a single proteome and the implications of a modular description of proteins for a functional interpretation. Poorly annotated proteins in the most documented bacteria (E. coli and B. subtilis) were considered in an attempt to formulate hypothesis on the basis of domain/module content.	amos;amino acid sequence;amino acids;antivirus software;chronology as topic;description;eventual consistency;exponent bias;information;medical device incompatibility problem;peptide sequence;pfam;prokaryote;protein family;proteome;quantitation;synthetic intelligence	Frédéric Nikitin;Frédérique Lisacek	2003	Computational biology and chemistry	10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2003.09.003	biology;domain;computer science;bioinformatics;protein sequencing;proteome;external data representation;protein function prediction;protein domain;protein structure database;protein family;genetics	Comp.	3.312614548123859	-59.49288679189344	186647
3e461daf0f8e9e36227294128219c325aba4f38b	time-averaged distributions of solute and solvent motions: exploring proton wires of gfp and pfm2dh		Proton translocation pathways of selected variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Pseudomonas fluorescens mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (PfM2DH) were investigated via an explicit solvent molecular dynamics-based analysis protocol that allows for direct quantitative relationship between a crystal structure and its time-averaged solute-solvent structure obtained from simulation. Our study of GFP is in good agreement with previous research suggesting that the proton released from the chromophore upon photoexcitation can diffuse through an extended internal hydrogen bonding network that allows for the proton to exit to bulk or be recaptured by the anionic chromophore. Conversely for PfM2DH, we identified the most probable ionization states of key residues along the proton escape channel from the catalytic site to bulk solvent, wherein the solute and high-density solvent crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes were properly reproduced. Furthermore, we proposed a plausible mechanism for this proton translocation process that is consistent with the state-dependent structural shifts observed in our analysis. The time-averaged structures generated from our analyses facilitate validation of MD simulation results and provide a comprehensive profile of the dynamic all-occupancy solvation network within and around a flexible solute, from which detailed hydrogen-bonding networks can be inferred. In this way, potential drawbacks arising from the elucidation of these networks by examination of static crystal structures or via alternate rigid-protein solvation analysis procedures can be overcome. Complementary studies aimed at the effective use of our methodology for alternate implementations (e.g., ligand design) are currently underway.	accidental falls;american cancer society;bitwise operation;catalytic domain;cheminformatics;computation;crystal structure;dna sequence rearrangement;description;distance;dosage forms;drug discovery;exhibits as topic;fifty nine;fluorescence;forty nine;frequency capping;gene regulatory network;glutamic acid;green fluorescent proteins;hydrogen bonding;image resolution;inference;journal of chemical information and modeling;kinetics;least fixed point;ligands;lysine;mandibular right second molar tooth;mannitol;mannitol 2-dehydrogenase;membrane proteins;molecular dynamics;motion;muscle rigidity;physical restraint equipment (device);population parameter;probability;proton-phosphate symporters;protons;published comment;pyschological bonding;quantity;sampling (signal processing);simulation;snapshot (computer storage);thermodynamics;water;water model;x-ray (amazon kindle);free energy;phenol;proton transport;solute	Camilo Velez-Vega;Daniel J.

Recently, concerns about immune responses to contaminating host cell proteins (HCPs) have emerged, mainly due to concerns about their contribution to anti-drug immune responses and drug safety. The presence of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) -derived HCPs contributed to the cancellation of two clinical trials in 2012. CHO cells are the most commonly used mammalian cell expression systems in recombinant protein production. The publication of the widely-used CHO-K1 genome and transcriptome provides an opportunity to analyze CHO HCPs and better understand their potential to drive immune responses. Of greatest concern are immune responses that may be cross-reactive with human T cell epitopes. We analyzed CHO-derived protein sequences from three overlapping datasets. These datasets consisted of (1) expressed; (2) putatively secreted; and (3) experimentally determined CHO HCPs. After arriving at a final subset of 1757 constitutively expressed CHO proteins, we used our T cell epitope prediction tool, EpiMatrix, to explore CHO HCP immunogenicity as defined by their relative epitope abundance. Each protein received an immunogenicity score reflecting T cell epitope content, and the results revealed 26% of the 1757 proteins analyzed were above a pre-defined threshold for potential immunogenicity, containing an abundance of predicted T cell epitopes. A subset of these proteins was then evaluated for epitopes that were substantially different from the human genome. This is the first step in the important process of uncovering the potential for HCPs to contribute to unwanted immunogenicity.	avengers: age of ultron;binary prefix;cell (microprocessor);chinese room;experiment;peptide sequence;recombinant dna	Andres H.

It is assumed that on the primitive Earth there arose a recycling flow-reactor containing spontaneously formed oil droplets or lipid aggregates. These droplets grew at a basal rate by simple incorporation of lipid phase material, and divided by external agitation. This type of system was able to implement a natural selection algorithm once heredity was added. Macroevolution became possible by selection for rarely occurring chemical reactions that produced holistic autocatalytic molecular replicators (contained within the aggregate) capable of doubling at least as fast as the lipid aggregate, and which were also capable of benefiting the growth of its lipid aggregate container. No nucleotides or monomers capable of modular heredity were required at the outset. To explicitly state this hypothesis, a computer model was developed that employed an artificial chemistry, exhibiting conservation of mass and energy, incorporated within each individual of a population of lipid aggregates. This model evolved increasingly complex self-sustaining processes of constitution, a result that is also expected in real chemistry.	aggregate data;anatomical compartments;artificial chemistry;assumed;autocatalytic set;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);avalanches;basal (phylogenetics);chemical vapor deposition;clinical use template;computer simulation;contain (action);dynamical system;esignet project;entity;evolutionary systems;exhibits as topic;experiment;eörs szathmáry;heredity aspects;holism;jarava ichu;kinetics;liposomes;multi-compartment model;natural selection;nucleotides;ork;period-doubling bifurcation;prebiotics;progeny linux systems;reactor (software);reactor device component;recycling;replicator (stargate);rigor - temperature-associated observation;selection algorithm;thermodynamics;unit;variety (cybernetics);wdfy2 wt allele;benefit;interest;monomer	Chrisantha Fernando;Jon Rowe	2008	Bio Systems	10.1016/j.biosystems.2007.05.012	computer simulation;biology;biochemistry;computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;ecology;genetics	ML	6.0041309175535105	-65.78986229671756	189204

In silico activation of the Rh structure was accomplished by isomerization of the 11-cis-retinal (1) chromophore, followed by constrained molecular dynamics to relax the resultant high energy structure. The activated form of Rh was then used as a structural template for development of a human 5-HT2A receptor model. Both the 5-HT2A receptor and Rh are members of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) super-family. The resulting homology model of the receptor was then used for docking studies of compounds representing a cross-section of structural classes that activate the 5-HT2A receptor, including ergolines, tryptamines, and amphetamines. The ligand/receptor complexes that ensued were refined and the final binding orientations were observed to be compatible with much of the data acquired through both diversified ligand design and site directed mutagenesis.	activation action;amphetamines;bos taurus;class;clinical use template;crystal structure;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;ergolines;homologous gene;homology (biology);homology modeling;ligands;molecular dynamics;rho gene;receptor, serotonin, 5-ht2a;resultant;retinaldehyde;tryptamines	James J.

To elucidate mechanisms by which these ubiquitous pathways are modulated, we overlaid information about cross-cell line protein abundance and variability, and evolutionary conservation onto functional pathway components and topological layers in the pathway hierarchy. We found that the input (receptors) and the output (transcription factors) layers evolve more rapidly than proteins in the intermediary transmission layer. In contrast, protein expression variability decreases from the input to the output layer. We observed that the differences in protein variability between the input and transmission layer can be attributed to both the network position and the tendency of variable proteins to physically interact with constitutively expressed proteins. Differences in protein expression variability and conservation are also accompanied by the tendency of conserved and constitutively expressed proteins to acquire somatic mutations, while germline mutations tend to occur in cell type-specific proteins. Thus, conserved core proteins in the transmission layer could perform a fundamental role in most cell types and are therefore less tolerant to germline mutations. In summary, we propose that the core signal transmission machinery is largely modulated by a variable input layer through physical protein interactions. We hypothesize that the bow-tie organization of cellular signaling on the level of protein abundance variability contributes to the specificity of the signal response in different cell types.	body tissue;cell signaling;conserved sequence;cultured cell line;diploid cell;gene regulatory network;heart rate variability;interaction;modulation;sensitivity and specificity;somatic mutation;spatial variability;transcription factor;transcription (software);anatomical layer;cell type;protein expression	Martin H.

In the present study, the promoter (∼1000bp) region of atpB gene was used to evaluate the genetic diversity and phylogeny of six local apple varieties. atpB gene is one of the large chloroplastic region which encodes β-subunit of ATP synthase and previously it had been used largely in phylogenetic studies. During the present study, atpB promoter was amplified, sequenced and analyzed using various bioinformatics tools including Place Signal Scan, MEGA6 and BLASTn. During the phylogenetic analysis, obtained phylogram divided the studied varieties into two clusters revealing the monophyletic origin of studied apple varieties. Pairwise distance revealed moderate genetic diversity that ranges from 0.047-0.170 with an average of 0.101. While identifying different cis-acting elements present in the atpB promoter region, results exhibited the occurrence of 56 common and 20 unique cis-regulatory elements among studied varieties. The identified cis-acting regulatory elements were mapped as well. It was observed that Kala Kulu has the highest unique features with reference to the availability of cis-acting elements. Moreover, the possible functions of all regulatory elements present on the promoter sequence of atpB gene were predicted based on already reported information regarding their in vivo role.

Among them, a key question is how to use simplified reactions to describe the chemical events of multi-step reactions that are ubiquitous in biochemistry and biophysics. To address this issue, a widely used approach in literature is to use one-step reaction to represent the multi-step chemical events. In recent years, a number of modelling methods have been designed to improve the accuracy of the one-step reaction method, including the use of reactions with time delay. However, our recent research results suggested that there are still deviations between the dynamics of delayed reactions and that of the multi-step reactions. Therefore, more sophisticated modelling methods are needed to accurately describe the complex biological systems in an efficient way. This work designs a two-variable model to simplify chemical events of multi-step reactions. In addition to the total molecule number of a species, we first introduce a new concept regarding the location of molecules in the multi-step reactions, which is the second variable to represent the system dynamics. Then we propose a simulation algorithm to compute the probability for the firing of the last step reaction in the multi-step events. This probability function is evaluated using a deterministic model of ordinary differential equations and a stochastic model in the framework of the stochastic simulation algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed two-variable model is demonstrated by the realization of mRNA degradation process based on the experimentally measured data. Numerical results suggest that the proposed new two-variable model produces predictions that match the multi-step chemical reactions very well. The successful realization of the mRNA degradation dynamics indicates that the proposed method is a promising approach to reduce the complexity of biological systems.	biochemical reaction;biochemistry;biological system;broadcast delay;elegant degradation;experiment;gillespie algorithm;mathematical model;mathematics;numerical linear algebra;numerous;simulation;stochastic modelling (insurance);system dynamics;systems biology;mrna degradation	Qianqian Wu;Kate Smith-Miles;Tianshou Zhou;Tianhai Tian	2013		10.1186/1752-0509-7-S4-S14	biology;medical research;computer science;bioinformatics;operations research;systems biology	AI	7.7085846627916546	-65.82617677099671	191117
889e2becab420b080f62a783f78db0b4c9c6a30d	identification of sumoylation activating enzyme 1 inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening		SUMO activating enzyme 1 (SUMO E1) is responsible for the activation of SUMO in the first step of the sumoylation cascade. SUMO E1 is linked to many human diseases including cancer, thus making it a potential therapeutic target. There are few reported SUMO E1 inhibitors including several natural products. To identify small molecule inhibitors of SUMO E1 with better drug-like properties for potential therapeutic studies, we have used structure-based virtual screening to identify hits from the Maybridge small molecule library for biological assay. Our virtual screening protocol involves fast docking of the entire small molecule library with rigid protein and ligands followed by redocking of top hits using a method that incorporates both ligand and protein flexibility. Subsequently, the top-ranking compounds were prioritized using the molecular dynamics simulation-based binding free energy calculation. Out of 24 compounds that were acquired and tested using in vitro sumoylation assay, four of them showed more than 85% inhibition of sumoylation with the most active compound showing an IC50 of 14.4 μM. A similarity search with the most active compound in the ZINC database has identified three more compounds with improved potency. These compounds share a common phenyl urea scaffold and have been confirmed to inhibit SUMO E1 by in vitro SUMO-1 thioester bond formation assay. Our study suggests that these phenyl urea compounds could be used as a starting point for the development of novel therapeutic agents.	biological assay;blood urea nitrogen measurement;boat dock;cascade device component;docking (molecular);greater than;inhibitory concentration 50;ligands;molecular dynamics;muscle rigidity;natural products;neoplasms;sumo-1 protein;similarity search;simulation;small molecule;sumoylation;therapeutic targets database;therapeutic agent (substance);virtual screening;zinc database;free energy;thioester	Ashutosh Kumar;Akihiro Ito;Mikako Hirohama;Minoru Yoshida;Kam Y.

The pattern of Y sequences present shows considerable variation between XX males. Furthermore, on the basis of the terminal transfer model, anomalous patterns of Y sequences are evident in certain XX males in that sequences located as proximal Yp by means of a Y deletion panel are found to be present in the absence of distal sequences. These anomalies can be resolved by proposing that the order of Yp sequences varies in the population in the form of inversion polymorphisms in the Y chromosomes of normal males. Alternatively, it is necessary to invoke multiple recombination events between the X and Y chromosomes to explain the patterns of Y sequences in these XX males. Southern analysis on DNA prepared from flow sorted X chromosomes of XX males indicates that the Y sequences in these patients are linked to X chromosomes.	46xx female genotype;chromosomes, artificial, mammalian;deletion mutation;fourteen;genetic polymorphism;p1 bacteriophage artificial chromosomes;patients;recombinants	N.

44ca914e8901a6752dbadd51acc10dd2a232d1f4	insights into structural variations and genome rearrangements in prokaryotic genomes		Structural variations (SVs) are genomic rearrangements that affect fairly large fragments of DNA. Most of the SVs such as inversions, deletions and translocations have been largely studied in context of genetic diseases in eukaryotes. However, recent studies demonstrate that genome rearrangements can also have profound impact on prokaryotic genomes, leading to altered cell phenotype. In contrast to single-nucleotide variations, SVs provide a much deeper insight into organization of bacterial genomes at a much better resolution. SVs can confer change in gene copy number, creation of new genes, altered gene expression and many other functional consequences. High-throughput technologies have now made it possible to explore SVs at a much refined resolution in bacterial genomes. Through this review, we aim to highlight the importance of the less explored field of SVs in prokaryotic genomes and their impact. We also discuss its potential applicability in the emerging fields of synthetic biology and genome engineering where targeted SVs could serve to create sophisticated and accurate genome editing.	chromosomal translocation;chromosome inversion;copy number;dna sequence rearrangement;ethanol 0.62 ml/ml topical gel;gene expression programming;genome;hereditary diseases;inversion (discrete mathematics);nucleotides;synthetic biology;throughput	Vinita Periwal;Vinod Scaria	2015	Bioinformatics	10.1093/bioinformatics/btu600	genetics	Comp.	3.927723738929653	-60.73969403646801	192692

Sirt4 is localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to preventing the development of cancers and ischemic heart disease through regulating energy metabolism. The ADP-ribosylation of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), which is catalyzed by Sirt4, downregulates the TCA cycle. However, this reaction mechanism is obscure, because the structure of Sirt4 is unknown. We here constructed structural models of Sirt4 by homology modeling and threading, and docked nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ (NAD+) to Sirt4. In addition, a partial GDH structure was docked to the Sirt4-NAD+ complex model. In the ternary complex model of Sirt4-NAD+-GDH, the acetylated lysine 171 of GDH is located close to NAD+. This suggests a possible mechanism underlying the ADP-ribosylation at cysteine 172, which may occur through a transient intermediate with ADP-ribosylation at the acetylated lysine 171. These results may be useful in designing drugs for the treatment of cancers and ischemic heart disease.

The knock-out experiment aimed to elucidate the transcriptomal regulators underlying the glycocalyx-regulation of vasculogenesis by performing global gene expression analysis of NDST mutants and wild-type siblings at three distinct time points during development. Cluster analysis and the construction of a genetic interaction network allows to identify groups of genes acting in the process of early stage vasculogenesis. We report the following findings: we found a large number of gene clusters, particularly glycans, during the three developmental steps of the zebrafish organism. In each step, genes connectivity changes according to two different powerlaws. The clusters are highlighted in such a way, that it is possible to see the dynamics of the interactions through the time points recorded in the microarray experiment. Vegf-related genes seem not to be involved at transcriptomics level, suggesting alternative regulative pathways do exist to modulate transcriptomal signatures in developing zebrafish. Our results show that there are several glycan-related genes which may be involved in early processes such as vasculogenesis.	glycomics	Anil Sorathiya;Tadas Jucikas;Stephanie Piecewicz;Shiladitya Sengupta;Pietro Liò	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-02504-4_18	interaction network;biology;microarray analysis techniques;molecular biology;stem cell;zebrafish information network genome database;gene cluster;computer science;bioinformatics;vasculogenesis;time series;cluster analysis;genetics;wild type;complex network	Robotics	4.626391040857559	-59.686657942967145	193037

It is very hard to identify AKAPs peptides binding to PKA due to the high sequence diversity of AKAPs.   RESULTS We propose a hierarchical and efficient approach, which combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy calculations, virtual mutagenesis (VM) and bioinformatics analyses, to predict peptides binding to the PKA RIIα regulatory subunit in the human proteome systematically. Our approach successfully retrieved 15 out of 18 documented RIIα-binding peptides. Literature curation supported that many newly predicted peptides might be true AKAPs. Here, we present the first systematic search for AKAP peptides in the human proteome, which is useful to further experimental identification of AKAPs and functional analysis of their biological roles.	8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate;a kinase anchor proteins;bioinformatics;computed tomographic colonography;dna binding site;digital curation;document completion status - documented;experiment;gene regulatory network;interaction;molecular dynamics;molecular dynamics;natural science disciplines;protein kinases;proteome;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;free energy	Tingjun Hou;Youyong Li;Wei Wang	2011	Bioinformatics	10.1093/bioinformatics/btr294	biology;biochemistry;molecular biology;bioinformatics;protein subunit;proteomics	Comp.	9.301214527094574	-60.50998427006596	193173

TIE-2-expressing monocytes (TEM) have been reported to critically account for tumor vascularization and growth in mouse tumor experimental models, but the molecular basis of their pro-angiogenic activity are largely unknown. Moreover, differences in the pro-angiogenic activity between blood circulating and tumor infiltrated TEM in human patients has not been established to date, hindering the identification of specific targets for therapeutic intervention. In this work, we investigated these differences and the phenotypic reversal of breast tumor pro-angiogenic TEM to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype by combining Boolean modelling and experimental approaches. Firstly, we show that in breast cancer patients the pro-angiogenic activity of TEM increased drastically from blood to tumor, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment shapes the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of TEM. Secondly, we predicted in silico all minimal perturbations transitioning the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of tumor TEM to the weak pro-angiogenic phenotype of blood TEM and vice versa. In silico predicted perturbations were validated experimentally using patient TEM. In addition, gene expression profiling of TEM transitioned to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype confirmed that TEM are plastic cells and can be reverted to immunological potent monocytes. Finally, the relapse-free survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference between patients with tumors with high and low expression values for genes encoding transitioning proteins detected in silico and validated on patient TEM. In conclusion, the inferred TEM regulatory network accurately captured experimental TEM behavior and highlighted crosstalk between specific angiogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways of outstanding importance to control their pro-angiogenic activity. Results showed the successful in vitro reversion of such an activity by perturbation of in silico predicted target genes in tumor derived TEM, and indicated that targeting tumor TEM plasticity may constitute a novel valid therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.	angiogenic process;boolean;breast carcinoma;color gradient;crosstalk;experiment;gene expression profiling;habitat;inference;malignant neoplasm of breast;mammary neoplasms;pathologic neovascularization;patients;reversion (software development);systems modeling;tumor microenvironment;cellular targeting	Nicolas Guex;Isaac Crespo;Sylvian Bron;Assia Ifticene-Treboux;Eveline Faes-van't Hull;Solange Kharoubi;Robin Liechti;Patricia Werffeli;Mark Ibberson;Francois Majo;Michäel Nicolas;Julien Laurent;Abhishek Garg;Khalil Zaman;Hans-Anton Lehr;Brian J.

Docking analysis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) analogues suggests the role of hydrogen bonding and other weak interactions in enzyme selectivity. Water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks and a halogen-bond interaction seem to stabilize the molecular recognition. A pharmacophore model was developed using 20 dTMP analogues. The pharmacophoric features were complementary to the active site residues involved in the ligand recognition. On the basis of these studies, a composite screening model that combines the features from both the docking analysis and the pharmacophore model was developed. The composite model was validated by screening a database spiked with 47 known inhibitors. The model picked up 42 of these, giving an enrichment factor of 17. The validated model was used to successfully screen an in-house database of about 500,000 compounds. Subsequent screening with other filters gave 186 hit molecules.		B. Gopalakrishnan;V. Aparna;J.

This determines cell-context specific responses to environmental stimuli. Given the difficulty of quantitating protein concentration and post-translational modifications, signaling pathway studies are still for the most part conducted one interaction at the time. Thus, genome-wide, cell-context specific dissection of signaling pathways is still an open challenge in molecular systems biology. In this manuscript we extend the MINDy algorithm for the identification of posttranslational modulators of transcription factor activity, to produce a first genome-wide map of the interface between signaling and transcriptional regulatory programs in human B cells. We show that the serine-threonine kinase STK38 emerges as the most pleiotropic signaling protein in this cellular context and we biochemically validate this finding by shRNA-mediated silencing of this kinase, followed by gene expression profile analysis. We also extensively validate the inferred interactions using protein-protein interaction databases and the kinase-substrate interaction prediction algorithm NetworKIN.	cell nucleus;cell signaling;database;databases;gene expression profiling;gene regulatory network;genetic translation process;inference;interface device component;manuscripts;molecular systems biology;post-translational protein processing;protein-serine-threonine kinases;stk38 gene;short hairpin rna;signal transduction pathways;transcription factor;threonine;transcription (software);transcription, genetic;transduction (machine learning);algorithm;protein protein interaction	Kai Wang;Mariano J.

6fdabb0576305fce81f484ce8364ed4cfeb65d81	molecular information of charybdotoxin blockade in the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel	calcium activated potassium channel	The scorpion toxin, charybdotoxin (ChTX), is the first identified peptide inhibitor for the large-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-dependent K+ (BK) channel, and the chemical information of the interaction between ChTX and BK channel remains unclear today. Using combined computational methods, we obtained a ChTX-BK complex structure model, which correlated well with the mutagenesis data. In this complex, ChTX mainly used its beta-sheet domains to associate the BK channel with a conserved pore-blocking Lys27. Another crucial Tyr36 residue of ChTX lied over the loop connecting selectivity filter and S6 helix of BK channel, forming a hydrogen bond with Gly291 of BK channel. Besides, the unique turret region of BK channel was found to be far away from bound ChTX, which could explain the fact that many BK channel blockers show less selectivity over Kv channels. Together, all these information is helpful to reveal the diverse interactions between scorpion toxins and potassium channels and can accelerate the molecular engineering of specific inhibitor design.	blocking (computing);calcium ion;calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1;charybdotoxin;cheminformatics;computation;conductance (graph);hydrogen bonding;interaction;selectivity (electronic);toxin	Su Qiu;Hong Yi;Hui Liu;Zhijian Cao;Yingliang Wu;Wenxin Li	2009	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci900025n	calcium-activated potassium channel;biochemistry;chemistry;bk channel	Mobile	8.864789731986587	-62.98695212154197	193699

The relationship between structure, function and regulation in complex cellular networks is still a largely open question. This complexity calls for proper mathematical models and methods relating network structure and functional properties. In this paper we focus on the problem of drug targets’ identification by detecting network alteration strategies which lead to a cell functionality loss. We propose a mathematical model, based on a bi-level programming formulation, to obtain the minimum cost disruption policy through the identification of specific gene deletions. These deletions represent drug target identification of new drug treatments for hindering bacterial infections.	mathematical model;schema (genetic algorithms)	Guglielmo Lulli;Enza Messina;Francesco Archetti;Stefano Lanzeni	2010	J.

To achieve this goal, the model bacterium Lactococcus lactis was grown at steady state in continuous cultures at different growth rates, and proteomic and transcriptomic data were thoroughly compared. Ratios of mRNA to protein were highly variable among proteins but also, for a given gene, between the different growth conditions. The modeling of cellular processes combined with a data fitting modeling approach allowed both translation efficiencies and degradation rates to be estimated for each protein in each growth condition. Estimated translational efficiencies and degradation rates strongly differed between proteins and were tested for their biological significance through statistical correlations with relevant parameters such as codon or amino acid bias. These efficiencies and degradation rates were not constant in all growth conditions and were inversely proportional to the growth rate, indicating a more efficient translation at low growth rate but an antagonistic higher rate of protein degradation. Estimated protein median half-lives ranged from 23 to 224 min, underlying the importance of protein degradation notably at low growth rates. The regulation of intracellular protein level was analysed through regulatory coefficient calculations, revealing a complex control depending on protein and growth conditions. The modeling approach enabled translational efficiencies and protein degradation rates to be estimated, two biological parameters extremely difficult to determine experimentally and generally lacking in bacteria. This method is generic and can now be extended to other environments and/or other micro-organisms.	amino acids;bacteria;codon (nucleotide sequence);coefficient;curve fitting;efficiency;elegant degradation;experiment;genetic translation process;lactococcus lactis;maxima and minima;proteome;proteomics;steady state;x-ray microtomography	Clémentine Dressaire;Christophe Gitton;Pascal Loubière;Véronique Monnet;Isabelle Queinnec;Muriel Cocaign-Bousquet	2009		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000606	biology;biochemistry;molecular biology;amino acid;bioinformatics;proteomics;systems biology	Comp.	7.515586046509714	-64.18309380119034	193910

Compound-protein interactions are measured in a biological context as opposed to in vitro binding assays. That is, drugprotein interactions can not only be determined proteome-wide, but also in a tissue- or cell type-dependent manner.	systems biology	Jacques Colinge;Uwe Rix;Keiryn L.

Biochemical networks that exhibit oscillatory behavior are used at the molecular level for essential timekeeping in the cell. In many cases, these networks involve transcriptional circuits that are intrinsically noisy. In a seminal paper from 2000, Elowitz and Leibler presented the repressilator: a synthetic oscillator implemented in E. coli using three mutually repressive genes [1]. Through experiments, stochastic and deterministic simulations they showed that the system is indeed oscillatory but extremely noisy due to the low number of molecules involved in the reactions.	biological system;experiment;kullback–leibler divergence;neural oscillation;repressilator;simulation;stochastic process;synthetic intelligence	Martin Hemberg;Mauricio Barahona	2007	BMC Systems Biology	10.1186/1752-0509-1-S1-S7	computational biology;biology;computational science;computer science;bioinformatics;systems biology	ML	7.445692054283265	-65.98527125426617	194246

In this project, virtual screening (VS) for novel Hsp90 inhibitors was performed using a combination of Autodock and Surflex-Sim (LB) scoring functions with the predictive ability of 3-D QSAR models, previously generated with the 3-D QSAutogrid/R procedure. Extensive validation of both structure-based (SB) and ligand-based (LB), through realignments and cross-alignments, allowed the definition of LB and SB alignment rules. The mixed LB/SB protocol was applied to virtually screen potential Hsp90 inhibitors from the NCI Diversity Set composed of 1785 compounds. A selected ensemble of 80 compounds were biologically tested. Among these molecules, preliminary data yielded four derivatives exhibiting IC50 values ranging between 18 and 63 μM as hits for a subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization procedure.	autodock;eighty;exhibits as topic;hsp90 heat-shock proteins;hsp90aa1 wt allele;inhibitory concentration 50;lattice boltzmann methods;ligands;mathematical optimization;medicinal chemistry;nc (complexity);quantitative structure-activity relationship;quantitative structure–activity relationship;rule (guideline);sandy bridge;score;scoring functions for docking;virtual screening;phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-associated serine kinase	Antonia Caroli;Flavio Ballante;Richard B.

The pattern of resistance to the inhibitor alpha-amanitin identifies the RNA as a product of RNA polymerase III transcription. The RNA is shown to initiate artificially near a DNA terminus created by cleavage and to terminate specifically near a cluster of 8 thymidine residues within the SV40 control region. Faithfully initiated transcripts cannot be detected using the calf thymus enzyme, supporting the idea that polymerase III termination can be accomplished by an initiation-deficient enzyme. Transcription of SV40 DNA in a HeLa cell lysate also leads to specific polymerase III transcription. When PvuII-cleaved DNA is the template, the same RNA is produced as with the calf thymus enzyme. At the lowered lysate concentration known to activate certain AluI-family transcripts, a collection of SV40 polymerase III transcripts is also produced. These do not depend on restriction cleavage of the DNA and thus arise from transcription of intact DNA.	activation action;alpha-amanitin;amanitins;cleaved cell;clinical use template;leukemia, b-cell;lysate;medical transcription;processor control region;rna polymerase iii;simian virus 40;terminate (software);thymidine;transcript;transcription (software);transcription initiation;transcription, genetic	J.

Mutation hotspots in DNA reflect intrinsic properties of the mutation process, such as sequence specificity, that manifests itself at the level of interaction between mutagens, DNA, and the action of the repair and replication machineries. The nucleotide sequence context of mutational hotspots is a fingerprint of interactions between DNA and repair/replication/modification enzymes, and the analysis of hotspot context provides evidence of such interactions. The hotspots might also reflect structural and functional features of the respective DNA sequences and provide information about natural selection. We discuss analysis of 8-oxoguanine-induced mutations in pro- and eukaryotic genes, polymorphic positions in the human mitochondrial DNA and mutations in the HIV-1 retrovirus. Comparative analysis of 8-oxoguanine-induced mutations and spontaneous mutation spectra suggested that a substantial fraction of spontaneous A x T-->C x T mutations is caused by 8-oxoGTP in nucleotide pools. In the case of human mitochondrial DNA, significant differences between molecular mechanisms of mutations in hypervariable segments and coding part of DNA were detected. Analysis of mutations in the HIV-1 retrovirus suggested a complex interplay between molecular mechanisms of mutagenesis and natural selection.	8-oxoguanine;base sequence;fingerprint;genetic hotspot;hiv;hotspot (wi-fi);interaction;java hotspot virtual machine;mutagens;mutation (genetic algorithm);natural selection;nucleotides;point accepted mutation;sensitivity and specificity;spontaneous order	Igor B.

Moreover, when a large number of substitutions are additionally involved in the divergence, the homology detection becomes difficult even at the DNA level. To cope with this situation, we propose a novel method to infer distant homology relations of two proteins, that accounts for frameshift and point mutations that may have affected the coding sequences. We design a dynamic programming alignment algorithm over memory-efficient graph representations of the complete set of putative DNA sequences of each protein, with the goal of determining the two putative DNA sequences which have the best scoring alignment under a powerful scoring system designed to reflect the most probable evolutionary process. This allows us to uncover evolutionary information that is not captured by traditional alignment methods, which is confirmed by biologically significant examples.	algorithm;data structure;dynamic programming;gap penalty;homology (biology);non-monotonic logic;substitution model	Marta Gîrdea;Laurent Noé;Gregory Kucherov	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04241-6_10	point mutation;biology;dna sequencing;structural alignment;multiple sequence alignment;gap penalty;bioinformatics;protein sequencing;sequence analysis;sequence alignment;frameshift mutation;graph;genetics;translation;alignment-free sequence analysis	Comp.	3.135477607786569	-59.90623326210897	196363

We use mutual information to reveal the latent periodicity of mRNA sequences. The latent periodicity of an mRNA sequence is a periodicity with a low level of similarity between any two periods inside the mRNA sequence. The mutual information between an artificial numerical sequence and an mRNA sequence is calculated. The length of the artificial sequence period is varied from 2 to 150. The high level of the mutual information between artificial and mRNA sequences allows us to find any type of latent periodicity of mRNA sequence. The latent periodicity of many mRNA coding regions has been found. For example, the retinoblastoma gene of HSRBS clone contains a region with a latent period equal to 45 bases. The A-RAF oncogene of HSARAFIR clone contains a region with a latent period equal to 84 bases. Integrated sequences for the regions with latent periodicity are determined. The potential significance of latent periodicity is discussed.	base;clone;high-level programming language;mutual information;numerical analysis;oncogenes;quasiperiodicity;rna, messenger;retinoblastoma genes	Eugene V.

In this report, we analyzed fusion genes in the genomes of two Helicobacter pylori strains (26695 and J99) and identified 32 fusion genes that are present as neighbours in one strain (components) and are fused in the second (composite), and vice-versa. The mechanism for each case of gene fusion is explored. All the genes identified as fusion products in this analysis were reported as essential genes in this bacterium in the previously documented transposon mutagenesis of H. pylori strain G27. This observation suggests the potential of the products of fusion genes as putative microbial drug targets. These results underscore the utility of bacterial genomic sequence comparisons for understanding gene evolution and for in silico drug target identification in the post-genomic era.		Kishore R.

Radiosensitivity is the relative susceptibility of cells, tissues, organs or organisms to the harmful effect of radiation. Effects of radiation include the mutation of DNA specialy in genes responsible for DNA repair. Identification of polymorphisms and genes responsible for an organismsradiosensitivity increases the knowledge about the cell cycle and the mechanism of radiosensitivity, possibly providing the researchers with a better understanding of the process of carcinogenesis. To obtain this results, mathematical modeling and data mining methods were used.

6d629c0de0d4bb715a80c162f3132d4580132ca6	a novel molecular dynamics approach to evaluate the effect of phosphorylation on multimeric protein interface: the αb-crystallin case study	biological patents;biomedical journals;text mining;europe pubmed central;citation search;citation networks;computational biology bioinformatics;research articles;abstracts;open access;life sciences;clinical guidelines;algorithms;full text;computer appl in life sciences;rest apis;orcids;europe pmc;biomedical research;microarrays;bioinformatics;literature search	Phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTM) employed by cells to regulate several cellular processes. Studying the effects of phosphorylations on protein structures allows to investigate the modulation mechanisms of several proteins including chaperones, like the small HSPs, which display different multimeric structures according to the phosphorylation of a few serine residues. In this context, the proposed study is aimed at finding a method to correlate different PTM patterns (in particular phosphorylations at the monomers interface of multimeric complexes) with the dynamic behaviour of the complex, using physicochemical parameters derived from molecular dynamics simulations in the timescale of nanoseconds. We have developed a methodology relying on computing nine physicochemical parameters, derived from the analysis of short MD simulations, and combined with N identifiers that characterize the PTMs of the analysed protein. The nine general parameters were validated on three proteins, with known post-translational modified conformation and unmodified conformation. Then, we applied this approach to the case study of αB-Crystallin, a chaperone which multimeric state (up to 40 units) is supposed to be controlled by phosphorylation of Ser45 and Ser59. Phosphorylation of serines at the dimer interface induces the release of hexamers, the active state of αB-Crystallin. 30 ns of MD simulation were obtained for each possible combination of dimer phosphorylation state and average values of structural, dynamic, energetic and functional features were calculated on the equilibrated portion of the trajectories. Principal Component Analysis was applied to the parameters and the first five Principal Components, which summed up to 84 % of the total variance, were finally considered. The validation of this approach on multimeric proteins, which structures were known both modified and unmodified, allowed us to propose a new approach that can be used to predict the impact of PTM patterns in multi-modified proteins using data collected from short molecular dynamics simulations. Analysis on the αB-Crystallin case study clusters together all-P dimers with all-P hexamers and no-P dimer with no-P hexamer and results suggest a great influence of Ser59 phosphorylation on chain B.	computation (action);domino tiling;genetic translation process;identifier;interface device component;modulation;molecular chaperones;molecular dynamics;numerous;phentolamine;phosphorylation;polynomial texture mapping;post-translational protein processing;principal component analysis;sample variance;simulation;structural dynamics;beta-crystallin a chain;monomer	Federica Chiappori;Luca Mattiazzi;Luciano Milanesi;Ivan Merelli	2016		10.1186/s12859-016-0909-9	biology;text mining;dna microarray;computer science;bioinformatics;data science;data mining	Comp.	8.206886033095454	-59.67842541437073	196850

Using the hydroxylapatite chromatography technique it was possible to demonstrate three classes of oestradiol-receptor complexes which differ in affinity for the chromatin. Oestradiol-receptor complexes with a high affinity for the chromatin were predominantly localized in the heavy chromatin fraction, whereas complexes with a lower affinity for their acceptor sites were present in the lighter chromatin fraction.	acceptor (semiconductors);centrifugation;centrifugation, density gradient;class;column chromatography;durapatite;estradiol;processor affinity;sucrose;uterus	Willem de Boer;Joan de Vries;Eppo Mulder;Henk J. van der Molen	1978	Nucleic acids research	10.1093/nar/5.1.87	biology;molecular biology;rna;chromatin;heterochromatin;immunology;genetics;anatomy;cell fractionation	Theory	5.681650860972876	-63.59107576770688	196887

Recent technology development allows us to determine the genome-wide chromatin accessibility in various cellular and developmental contexts. The chromatin accessibility profiles provide useful information in prediction of TF binding events in various physiological conditions. Furthermore, ChIP-Seq analysis was used to determine genome-wide binding sites for a range of different TFs in multiple cell types. Integration of these two types of genomic information can improve the prediction of TF binding events. We assessed to what extent a model built upon on other TFs and/or other cell types could be used to predict the binding sites of TFs of interest. A random forest model was built using a set of cell type-independent features such as specific sequences recognized by the TFs and evolutionary conservation, as well as cell type-specific features derived from chromatin accessibility data. Our analysis suggested that the models learned from other TFs and/or cell lines performed almost as well as the model learned from the target TF in the cell type of interest. Interestingly, models based on multiple TFs performed better than single-TF models. Finally, we proposed a universal model, BPAC, which was generated using ChIP-Seq data from multiple TFs in various cell types. Integrating chromatin accessibility information with sequence information improves prediction of TF binding.The prediction of TF binding is transferable across TFs and/or cell lines suggesting there are a set of universal “rules”. A computational tool was developed to predict TF binding sites based on the universal “rules”.	accessibility;binding sites;cell (microprocessor);chip-on-chip;conserved sequence;cultured cell line;dna binding site;random forest;rule (guideline);transcription (software);transcription factor binding	Sheng Liu;Cristina Zibetti;Jun Wan;Guohua Wang;Seth Blackshaw;Jiang Qian	2017		10.1186/s12859-017-1769-7	dna;dna microarray;dna binding site;genetics;transferability;transcription factor;biology;bioinformatics;binding site;chromatin;plasma protein binding	Comp.	4.103080451644815	-59.57760122744621	197175

Recently, small molecules have been found which bind to Gbetagamma with high apparent affinity in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), have demonstrated selective inhibition of interactions of Gbetagamma with downstream signaling partners, and have been shown to increase antinociceptive effects of morphine and inhibit inflammation in vivo. In this paper we examine several docking and scoring protocols for estimating binding affinities for a set of 830 ligands from the NCI diversity set to the Gbeta1gamma2 subunit and compared these with IC50s measured in a competition ELISA with a high-affinity peptidic ligand. The best-performing docking protocol used a consensus score and ensemble docking and resulted in a 6-fold enrichment of high-affinity compounds in the top-ranked 5% of the ligand data set.

The pathogenicity of H. pylori is enhanced by its well-developed DNA repair mechanism, thought of as 'machinery,' such as nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER involves multi-enzymatic excinuclease proteins (UvrABC endonuclease), which repair damaged DNA in a sequential manner. UvrB is the central component in prokaryotic NER, essential for damage recognition. Therefore, molecular modeling studies of UvrB protein from H. pylori are carried out with homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results reveal that the predicted structure is bound to a DNA hairpin with 3-bp stem, an 11-nucleotide loop, and 3-nt 3' overhang. In addition, a mutation of the Y96A variant indicates reduction in the binding affinity for DNA. Free-energy calculations demonstrate the stability of the complex and help identify key residues in various interactions based on residue decomposition analysis. Stability comparative studies between wild type and mutant protein-DNA complexes indicate that the former is relatively more stable than the mutant form. This predicted model could also be useful in designing new inhibitors for UvrB protein, as well as preventing the pathogenesis of H. pylori.	dna repair;gastric tissue;helicobacter pylori ab:acnc:pt:ser:qn;homologous gene;homology (biology);homology modeling;inhibition;interaction;molecular dynamics;mutant proteins;mutation;nucleotide excision repair;nucleotides;numerous;pathogenicity;processor affinity;simulation;wild type;endonuclease;molecular modeling	Rohit Bavi;Raj Kumar;Shailima Rampogu;Minky Son;Chanin Park;Ayoung Baek;Hyong-Ha Kim;Jung-Keun Suh;Seok Ju Park;Keun Woo Lee	2016	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.06.005	nucleotide excision repair;microbiology;genetics	Comp.	8.409079540049914	-62.43441892644528	198179

We show that this function is particularly effective when one of the targets is a Transcription Factor (TF) which regulates the other targets. This combination defines a new class of feed-forward loops (FFLs) in which the microRNA plays the role of master regulator. Using both deterministic and stochastic equations, we show that these FFLs are indeed able not only to fine-tune the TF/target ratio to any desired value as a function of the miRNA concentration but also, thanks to the peculiar topology of the circuit, to ensure the stability of this ratio against stochastic fluctuations. These two effects are due to the interplay between the direct transcriptional regulation and the indirect TF/Target interaction due to competition of TF and target for miRNA binding (the so called """"sponge effect""""). We then perform a genome wide search of these FFLs in the human regulatory network and show that they are characterized by a very peculiar enrichment pattern. In particular, they are strongly enriched in all the situations in which the TF and its target have to be precisely kept at the same concentration notwithstanding the environmental noise. As an example we discuss the FFL involving E2F1 as Transcription Factor, RB1 as target and miR-17 family as master regulator. These FFLs ensure a tight control of the E2F/RB ratio which in turns ensures the stability of the transition from the G0/G1 to the S phase in quiescent cells."""	anatomy, regional;gene ontology term enrichment;medical transcription;mercury:mcnt:pt:feed:qn;micrornas;transcription factor;the final fantasy legend;transcription, genetic;transcriptional regulation	Andrea Riba;Carla Bosia;Mariama El Baroudi;Laura Ollino;Michele Caselle	2014		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003490	stochastic process;biology;gene regulatory network;molecular biology;regulation of gene expression;gene expression;genome instability;bioinformatics;transcription;genetics;microrna;transcription factor	ML	6.775649670207888	-64.1498995671132	198619

Its structure is crucial in allowing RNA to serve its functions. SARNA-Predict-pk, which uses Simulated Annealing (SA), has shown excellent results in predicting the secondary structure of RNA molecules. Since SARNA-Predict-pk identifies low energy structures, it relies on thermodynamic energy models to do its energy calculations. SARNA-Predict-pk incorporates the use of energy models that have been used in the Hotknots 2.0 algorithm for calculations of minimum energy for potential secondary structures. This paper investigates how incorporating new versions of these energy parameters into SARNA-Predict-pk affects the results of SARNA-Predict-pk, specifically in the sensitivity, selectivity and F-measure. The results presented in this paper show that the new parameters in the Dirks-Pierce (DP) and the Cao-Chen (CC) energy models do not improve the results in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and F-measure of the SARNA-Predict-pk algorithm. This supports the use of the older parameters in these energy models when using SARNA-Predict-pk.	acid;algorithm;bioinformatics;computational biology;computational intelligence;entity–relationship model;f1 score;heuristic (computer science);li-chen wang;pierce oscillator;selectivity (electronic);simulated annealing	Peter Grypma;Jonathan Babbitt;Herbert H.

Therefore, identification and development of small molecule inhibitors targeting AKT and its signaling pathway can be therapeutic in treatment of cancer. Numerous studies report inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket in the kinase domains, but the similarity of this site, within the kinase family makes selectivity a major problem. The sequence identity amongst PH domains is significantly lower than that in kinase domains and developing more selective inhibitors is possible if PH domain is targeted. This in silico screening study is the first time report toward the identification of potential allosteric inhibitors expected to bind the cavity between kinase and PH domains of Akt1. Structural information of Akt1 was used to develop structure-based pharmacophore models comprising hydrophobic, acceptor, donor and ring features. The 3D structural information of previously identified allosteric Akt inhibitors obtained from literature was employed to develop a ligand-based pharmacophore model. Database was generated with drug like subset of ZINC and screening was performed based on 3D similarity to the selected pharmacophore hypotheses. Binding modes and affinities of the ligands were predicted by Glide software. Top scoring hits were further analyzed considering 2D similarity between the compounds, interactions with Akt1, fitness to pharmacophore models, ADME, druglikeness criteria and Induced-Fit docking. Using virtual screening methodologies, derivatives of 3-methyl-xanthine, quinoline-4-carboxamide and 2-[4-(cyclohexa-1,3-dien-1-yl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]phenol were proposed as potential leads for allosteric inhibition of Akt1.	adme study;acceptor (semiconductors);biological specimen;boat dock;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;dental caries;docking (molecular);gene regulatory network;glide;interaction;ligands;malignant neoplasms;phosphotransferases;proto-oncogene proteins c-akt;score;selectivity (electronic);sequence alignment;small molecule;subgroup;virtual screening;xanthine oxidase;cellular targeting;pharmacophore;tumor tissue	Oya Gursoy Yilmaz;Elif Ozkirimli Olmez;Kutlu Ö.

Ribosome competition is a specific form of context dependence, where all genes in the network compete for a limited pool of translational resources available for gene expression. Recently, theoretical and experimental studies have shown that ribosome competition creates a hidden layer of interactions among genes, which largely hinders our ability to predict design outcomes. In this work, we establish a control theoretic framework, where these hidden interactions become disturbance signals. We then propose a distributed feedback mechanism to achieve disturbance decoupling in the network. The feedback loop at each node consists of the protein product transcriptionally activating a small RNA (sRNA), which forms a translationally inactive complex with mRNA rapidly. We illustrate that with this feedback mechanism, protein production at each node is only dependent on its own transcription factor inputs, and almost independent of hidden interactions arising from ribosome competition.	artificial gene synthesis;coupling (computer programming);feedback;gene regulatory network;interaction;synthetic intelligence;theory;transcription (software)	Yili Qian;Domitilla Del Vecchio	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798359	attenuation;gene expression;bioinformatics;engineering;coupling;steady state;robustness	ML	6.514671483325784	-65.60062822115923	199106

The links of a node describe which other individuals can be displaced by the offspring of the individual on that node. Amplifiers of selection are graphs for which the fixation probability is increased for advantageous mutants and decreased for disadvantageous mutants. A few examples of such amplifiers have been developed, but so far it is unclear how many such structures exist and how to construct them. Here, we show that almost any undirected random graph is an amplifier of selection for Birth-death updating, where an individual is selected to reproduce with probability proportional to its fitness and one of its neighbors is replaced by that offspring at random. If we instead focus on death-Birth updating, in which a random individual is removed and its neighbors compete for the empty spot, then the same ensemble of graphs consists of almost only suppressors of selection for which the fixation probability is decreased for advantageous mutants and increased for disadvantageous mutants. Thus, the impact of population structure on evolutionary dynamics is a subtle issue that will depend on seemingly minor details of the underlying evolutionary process.	amplifier;anatomic node;cessation of life;evolutionary algorithm;genetic selection;graph (discrete mathematics);graph - visual representation;random graph;the offspring;mutant	Laura Hindersin;Arne Traulsen	2015		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004437	random graph;game theory;natural selection;directed graph;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;markov process;markov model;graph;statistics	Theory	5.872372021255679	-65.68737688137563	199217

Class I RNAs are represented by a 24-nucleotide RNA (RNA 16.24), and class II RNAs are represented by a 33-nucleotide RNA (RNA 27.33). RNA 16.24 inhibits thrombin-catalyzed fibrin clot formation in vitro. Secondary structures are proposed for these RNAs, revealing a novel stem-loop structure for RNA 16.24, comprised of an unusually large 16-nucleotide loop. Mutants of RNA 16.24 were generated to investigate structural features critical to high-affinity binding. Phosphate modification with ethylnitrosourea identified regions of the RNAs necessary for electrostatic interactions. Competition with heparin suggests that these RNAs bind the electropositive heparin-binding site of thrombin. These ligands represent a novel class of thrombin inhibitors that may be suitable for therapeutic or diagnostic applications.	biological evolution;class;clotrimazole;dec alpha;ethylnitrosourea;gene ontology term enrichment;interaction;ligands;neoplasm metastasis;processor affinity;rna;selex aptamer technique;heparin;mutant;phosphate ion	Mark F.

Proteins often work in complex assemblies of several macromolecules and small ligands. The structural and functional description of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is very important for basic-, as well as applied research. The interface areas of protein complexes have unique structure and properties, so PPI represent prospective targets for a new generation of drugs. One of the key targets of PPI inhibitors are oligomeric enzymes. This report shows interactive links between virtual and experimental approaches in a total pipeline """"from gene to drug"""" and using Surface Plasmon Resonance technology for experimentally assessing PPI. Our research is conducted on two oligomeric enzymes -- HIV-1 protease (HIVp) (homo-dimer) and bacterial L-asparaginase (homo-tetramer). Using methods of molecular modeling and computational alanine scanning we obtained structural and functional description of PPI in these two enzymes.
