Nevertheless, many issues arise in the use of such devices on the choice of interfaces and channels used for each flow. In this context, several works have been done to study the MRMCN (Multi Radio and Multi Channel Networks). Some of them studied the scheduling process into queues but our work is focused on the scheduling of transmitter interfaces versus receivers interfaces. In this paper, we have focused on WLMN 802.11s (Wireless LAN Mesh Network). We have presented a brief review of scheduling algorithm and then proposed our approach, based on dWRR (Dynamic Weighted Round Robin) Algorithm, for sharing one reception interface by several transmission interfaces. Results show that our approach have not only added the services differentiation and avoided network starvation but also increased the QoS by reducing End to End Delay and Packet Loss Ratio.	algorithm;mesh networking;scheduling (computing);transmitter;weighted round robin	Nabil Torjemen;Nabil Tabbane;Hend Baklouti;Sami Tabbane	2014	The 2014 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications	10.1109/SNCC.2014.6866520	wireless mesh network;fair-share scheduling;switched mesh;real-time computing;mesh networking;shared mesh;optical mesh network;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;order one network protocol;round-robin scheduling;computer network	Mobile	4.459985173666979	95.73760808164919	199541
