This framework is based on a generic tensor optimization model and an optimization method termed Maximum Block Improvement (MBI) recently developed in [3]. Not only can this framework be applied for co-clustering gene expression data with genes expressed at different conditions represented in 2D matrices, but it can also be readily applied for co-clustering more complex high-dimensional gene expression data with genes expressed at different tissues, different development stages, different time points, different stimulations, etc. Moreover, the new framework is so flexible that it poses no difficulty at all to incorporate a variety of clustering quality measurements. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach by providing the details of one specific implementation of the algorithm, and presenting the experimental testing on microarray gene expression datasets. Our results show that the new algorithm is very efficient and it performs well for identifying patterns in gene expression datasets.	algorithm;biclustering;cluster analysis;experiment;gene co-expression network;generic programming;image scaling;master of business informatics;mathematical optimization;microarray;preprocessor;real life;video post-processing	Shuzhong Zhang;Kun Wang;Bilian Chen;Xiuzhen Huang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24855-9_1	computer science;bioinformatics;data mining;database	Comp.	7.200582640116527	-49.592258844217774	199526

A common criterion to decide on the number of selected genes is minimizing the classifier error. However, considering the risk of overfitting due to the small sample size, and the fact that the number of selected genes is usually larger than the suspected number of discriminating genes, this work proposes relaxing the minimum error rate criterion. The paper shows that from a small number of feature selection and classification methods, it is possible to find configurations that select few genes without significantly worsening the error rate of the best classifier. Average ranking for 10 to 40 genes shows that SVM-RFE with Naive Bayes and FCBF with SVM behave consistently well.	microarray	Carlos J. Alonso;Q. Isaac Moro;Oscar J.
