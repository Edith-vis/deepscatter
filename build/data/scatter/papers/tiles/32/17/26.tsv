The proposed algorithm assigns to each node a potential value which is dynamically calculated in such a way that network traffic tends to be deflected from nodes that are radiating high EMI and/or locating far away from gateways. Simulations demonstrate that, compared to the shortest path routing, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the effects of EMI to the surrounding area where the wireless network is deployed. Besides, it is scalable to the network size because it only requires one-hop neighbor information.	algorithm;autonomous robot;computer simulation;emi;interference (communication);network traffic control;routing;scalability;shortest path problem;software deployment;telecommunications network	Quang-Dung Ho;Thanh-Ngon Tran;Tho Le-Ngoc	2011	2011 24th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering(CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2011.6030563	wireless routing protocol;routing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	5.148685671025961	81.14503167914337	148645

Various techniques have been proposed to cope with data congestion, such as data aggregation techniques, multi hop routing techniques and flow control techniques. Although these techniques help to avoid or control congestion, they do not address the issue of data persistency effectively. This paper presents an adaptive self configuring in-network storage model for data persistency in wireless sensor networks. The model is built on a clustered sensor field where we have utilized dense node deployment in the vicinity of the routing nodes to act as data buffers during congestion periods in order to avoid data loss. We show that the in-network storage model can be used in combination with congestion avoidance/control techniques to develop data persistent congestion avoidance/control strategies	data aggregation;elegant degradation;flow control (data);network congestion;persistence (computer science);persistent data structure;routing;sensor node;sensor web;software deployment;storage model;throughput	Majid I.

To ensure scalability sensor networks are often partitioned into clusters, each managed by a cluster head. Since sensors self organize in the form of clusters within a hierarchal wireless sensor network, it is necessary for a sensor node to perform target tracking cooperating with a set of sensors that belong to another cluster. The increased flexibility allows for efficient and optimized use of sensor nodes. While most of the previous research focused on the optimal communication of sensors in one cluster, very little attention has been paid to the efficiency of cooperation among the clusters. This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm of designing optimal structure across clusters to allow the inter-cluster flow of communication and resource sharing under reliability constraints. Such a guarantee simultaneously provides fault tolerance against node failures and high capacity through multi-path routing.

2427013e35fdafa59640fa5086e5d546bc7d7c41	reduced overhead for intra-cluster and inter-cluster sensor-to-actor communications in ieee 802.15.4 networks	bandwidth saving;energy efficiency;wsans;medium access control;sensor to actor communications;ieee 802154;wsns;zigbee;inter cluster communications;mac;intra cluster communications;wireless sensor and actor networks;wireless sensor networks	This paper proposes a novel way to enable sensor-to-actor communications in wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) that only requires a simple modification to the IEEE 802.15.4 header. Although this standard includes the definition of sensor-to-actor communication, it does not address how to provide it. Our proposal is able to provide this sensor-to-actor communication at the 802.15.4 MAC layer, thereby reducing the overhead of the additional network header, and achieving an important reduction of the energy consumption. In addition, avoiding the need of a network layer with full routing capabilities in the sensors provides further memory, processing and communications saving. More-over, this paper considers two scenarios for sensor-to-actor communications: intracluster and intercluster. The former enables the communication among sensors/actors at the same wireless sensor and actor network, and the latter allows sensors/actors located in geographically separated cluster to communicate transparently as if they were in the same WSAN.	byte;network topology;overhead (computing);routing;sensor;star network;testbed;tree network	Ángel Cuevas;Manuel Urueña;Rubén Cuevas Rumín;Noël Crespi	2013	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2013.058502	embedded system;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.072943372931667	80.19970204174854	150721

However data communication between nodes consumes a large portion of the total energy of WSNs. Consequently efficient data aggregation technique can help greatly to reduce power consumption. Data aggregation has emerged as a basic approach in WSNs in order to reduce the number of transmissions of sensor nodes over aggregation tree and hence minimizing the overall power consumption in the network. If a sensor node fails during data aggregation then the aggregation tree is disconnected. Hence the WSNs rely on in-network aggregation for efficiency but a single faulty node can severely influence the outcome by contributing an arbitrary partial aggregate value. In this paper we have presented a distributed algorithm that reconstruct the aggregation tree from the initial aggregation tree excluding the faulty sensor node. This is a synchronous model, completed in several rounds. Our proposed scheme can handle multiple number of faulty nodes as well.	aggregate data;best, worst and average case;data aggregation;distributed algorithm;handel;sensor node;time complexity	Punit Sharma;Partha Sarathi Mandal	2010	2010 Sixth International conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks		distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	8.986376890744378	79.00973378548491	150900

However Gateway-to-Gateway (G2G) communication to exchange and update information among the gateways in large-scale sensor networks for query processing, data fusion and other similar tasks has been less discussed in recent works. The requirements for large-scale sensor networks such as dynamic topology and update strategies to reduce the overall network load makes G2G communications an important aspect in the network design. In this paper, we introduce a mediated gossip-based G2G communication mechanism. The proposed solution leverages the publish/subscribe approach and uses high-level context assigned to publish/subscribe channels to enable the information discovery and G2G communications. Gateways store/aggregate sensor observation and measurement data according to specific context which is defined based on features such as spatial and temporal attributes, observed phenomena (i.e. feature of interest) and sensor device features. The gateways communicate with each other to exchange data and also to forward related queries for data aggregation in cases that the data should be aggregated from two different sources. The proposed solution also facilitates reliable sensor service provisioning by enabling gateways to communicate and/or forward requests to other gateways when a resource fails or a sensor node becomes unavailable. We compare our results to probabilistic gossiping algorithms and run benchmarks on different dynamic network topologies based on indicators such as number of sent messages and dissemination delay.	access time;aggregate data;algorithm;data aggregation;database;high- and low-level;information discovery;network planning and design;network topology;overlay network;peer-to-peer;preprocessor;provisioning;publish–subscribe pattern;relay;requirement;sensor node	Frieder Ganz;Payam M.

So the quality-of-service (QoS) of the network should be guaranteed to ensure the reliability of the whole platform. The transmission path is consisted with nodes. The nodes' performance directly influence the performance of the network. This paper is established models of the nodes and packet behavior during the transmission.

Therefore, fusion-driven routing protocols for sensor networks cannot optimize over communication cost only - fusion cost must also be accounted for. In our prior work, while a randomized algorithm termed MFST is devised toward this end, it assumes that fusion shall be performed at any intersection node whenever data streams encounter. In this paper, we design a novel routing algorithm, called adaptive fusion Steiner tree (AFST), for energy efficient data gathering. Not only does AFST jointly optimize over the costs for both data transmission and fusion, but also AFST evaluates the benefit and cost of data fusion along information routes and adaptively adjusts whether fusion shall be performed at a particular node. Analytically and experimentally, we show that AFST achieves better performance than existing algorithms, including SLT, SPT, and MFST	data redundancy;experiment;hall-effect thruster;randomized algorithm;requirement;routing;steiner tree problem	Hong Luo;Jun Luo;Yonghe Liu;Sajal K.

Its aim is to increase the road safety and transport facility efficiency. It also provides a ubiquitous wireless environment for the end users. The vehicle area network is considered as one of the major applications for wireless networks. Here, each vehicle has a unique identifier and eavesdropper to accumulate the locations of vehicles. If the vehicle changes its pseudonym from time to time, then the long-term tracking is to be avoided. The proposed model automatically monitors the flow of vehicles and sends the data to the control room via gateway nodes. It uses number of sensors to reduce the traffic at important junctions while forwarding the vehicle from one place to another.	identifier;sensor;unique key;vehicle area network;vehicle-to-vehicle	P.

f887c775f02acbcfcca4236c65063bc41d7573ee	a fuzzy based energy-aware clustering architecture for cooperative communication in wsn		In wireless sensor networks (WSN), the clustering technique reduces energy efficiency and network lifetime. In this paper, a Fuzzy-based clustering architecture is proposed for cooperative communication in WSN in order to overcome this issue. In this work, a Cluster Head (CH) is chosen based on the parameters residual energy, trust, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and load. Then, the intra-cluster routing is performed using network coding-based probabilistic routing scheme. The fuzzy-based clustering protocol helps in determining the cooperative node (CN) which joins the cluster. Finally, particle swarm optimization is used to establish the optimum path between each CN and the CH for data transmission. The simulation results show that the proposed technique enhances the network lifetime and energy efficiency.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;cooperative mimo;interference (communication);linear network coding;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;routing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	I.

VANETs are special subclass of Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) for inter-vehicle communication and have relatively more dynamic nature compared to MANETs due to the rapid network topology changes. The development and implementation of efficient and scalable algorithms for information dissemination in VANETs is a major issue which has taken enormous attention in the last years. In this paper, an efficient distributed information dissemination approach is proposed, inspired by Ant-colony communication principles, such as scalability and adaptability that are useful for developing a decentralized architecture in highly dynamic networks. The main objective is to provide each vehicle with relevant information about its surrounding to allow drivers to be aware of undesirable events and road conditions. A “relevance” value into emergency messages is defined as an analog to pheromone throwing in Ant colony, to take an appropriate action.

bae80de0b29164d623a3365209f724513851be0c	routing in mobile wireless sensor network: a survey	mobility and energy efficiency;routing;mobile wireless sensor network;survey	The Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (MWSN) is an emerging technology with significant applications. The MWSN allows the sensor nodes to move freely and they are able to communicate with each other without the need for a fixed infrastructure. These networks are capable of out-performing static wireless sensor networks as they tend to increase the network lifetime, reduce the power consumption, provide more channel capacity and perform better targeting. Usually routing process in a mobile network is very complex and it becomes even more complicated in MWSN as the sensor nodes are low power, cost effective mobile devices with minimum resources. Recent research works have led to the design of many efficient routing protocols for MWSN but still there are many unresolved problems like retaining the network connectivity, reducing the energy cost, maintaining adequate sensing coverage etc. This paper addresses the various issues in routing and presents the state of the art routing protocols in MWSN. The routing protocols are categorized based on their network structure, state of information, energy efficiency and mobility. The classification presented here summarizes the main features of many published proposals in the literature for efficient routing in MWSN and also gives an insight into the enhancements that can be done to improve the existing routing protocols.	mobile phone;routing	Getsy S.

This paper proposes an approach for realizing ICN-based data dissemination in vehicular networks. An architecture for organizing and disseminating information in a vehicle is suggested. The concept of cluster of common interest is proposed, with which groups of vehicles can be established dynamically according to the information they are interested in. Within each cluster, information are disseminated to the vehicles in a way decided by the features of the information. To show the feasibility of our approach, the approach has been implemented and tested in the simulation environment.	cache (computing);icn gps;list of code lyoko episodes;organizing (structure);scalability;simulation	Yuhong Li;Theo Kanter;Rahim Rahmani;Lars C.

Wireless vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) using all kinds of routing algorithms of low-energy efficiency has recently received considerable attention. Clustering algorithm has a significant impact on the operation of WSN. Effective clustering algorithm leads WSN to operate efficiently. Hierarchical clustering is a new clustering scheme in WSN. This study presents a novel vehicular clustering scheme integrating hierarchical clustering on the basis of classical routing algorithm. Simulation results show that the new scheme efficiently mitigates the hot spot problem in WSN and achieves much improvement in network lifetime and load balance compared to the old algorithm which is Direct, LEACH and DCHS.	algorithm;cluster analysis;routing	Yuhua Liu;Naixue N.

We show that its use in sensor networks improves their performance significantly with minimal overhead and that it increases their flexibility under changing conditions.	algorithm;artificial neural network;camera resectioning;high- and low-level;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation;user (computing)	Daniel Minder;Marcus Handte;Pedro José Marrón	2010	2010 Seventh International Conference on Networked Sensing Systems (INSS)	10.1109/INSS.2010.5572218	sensor web;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;engineering;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	8.294125228873797	75.20943709801357	153344

Proposed protocol builds on the observation that when a region of network system has a sufficient density of nodes, It is a distributed, delegated algorithm where nodes make local decisions on whether to sleep, or to join a forwarding discovery mode as a cluster head. Each node bases its decision on an estimate of how many of its neighbors will benefit from it being awake, and the amount of energy available to it. We give a algorithm where coordinators rotate with residual battery, demonstrating how localized node decisions lead to a connected, capacity-preserving global topology. Improvement in system lifetime due to change cluster head increases as the ratio of idle-to-sleep energy consumption increases. Our simulations show energy model. Additionally, This protocol also improves communication latency and capacity.	algorithm;backoff;computer cluster;hex;hoc (programming language);network packet;routing;simulation	Youngho Kim;Jaesub Kim;Heungwoo Nam;Sunshin An	2012	2012 IEEE 15th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/ICCSE.2012.98	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	7.439886848214693	80.1859518792262	153529
01974a09a2a49d6ff610181ed08121cc264f5c8f	a centralized algorithm for topology management in mobile ad-hoc networks through multiple coordinators	topology management;mobile ad hoc network	The topology of a MANET is maintained enduring transmission failures by suitably selecting multiple coordinators among the nodes constituting the MANET. The basic philosophy behind the algorithm is to isolate four coordinators based on positional data. Once elected, they are entrusted with the responsibility to emit signals of different frequencies while the other nodes individually decide the logic they need to follow in order to maintain the topology, thereby eliminating the need for routing. The algorithm is going to be formulated in such a way, that the entire network is going to move in one direction while each node can move freely. As far as our knowledge goes, we are the first ones to conceive the concept of multiple coordinators. The simulation results prove the efficacy of the scheme in topology maintenance.	algorithm;centralized computing;network topology;routing;simulation	Abhishek Bhattacharyya;Anand Seetharam;Mrinal K.

In addition to reliably and efficiently delivering messages, the electric energy consumed by nodes has to be reduced. In this paper, we discuss an energy-efficient broadcast protocol in wireless networks so that the total electric energy consumed by nodes can be reduced. In our previous studies, types of broadcast protocols, EEB and EEB2 protocols are proposed. Here, each node first selects first-neighbour nodes as child nodes. In the EEB protocol, a farthest child node is truncated until there is no other child node which can energy-efficiently forward messages to the node. A parent node consumes more electric energy to send messages to farther child nodes. Hence, a farthest child node is truncated if the distance from the parent node is longer in the EEB2 protocol. In this paper, we newly propose an augmented energy-efficient broadcast (AEEB) protocol. In the EEB and EEB2 protocols, a child node is selected for a parent node. On the other hand, one parent node is selected among possible parent nodes of each child node, which is nearest to the child node in the AEEB protocol. We evaluate the AEEB protocol and show the total electric energy consumed by nodes can be reduced.	broadcast domain;communications protocol;ssi ceb;tree (data structure)	Miyu Sugino;Shigenari Nakamura;Tomoya Enokido;Makoto Takizawa	2016	2016 30th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA)	10.1109/WAINA.2016.145	communications protocol;trustworthiness;exposed node problem;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	6.374239224466474	80.51210157147803	155426

When the physical sensor network has an irregular shape and possibly holes, the mapping of data to sensors often creates unbalanced storage load with high data concentration on nodes near network boundaries. In this paper we propose to map data to a covering space, which is a tiling of the plane with copies of the sensor network, such that the sensors receive uniform storage load and traffic. We propose distributed algorithms to construct the covering space with Ricci flow and Möbius transforms. The use of the covering space improves the performance of many in-network storage and retrieval schemes such as geographical hash tables (GHTs) or the double rulings (quorum based schemes), and provides better load balanced routing.	computer data storage;covering space;distributed algorithm;hash table;map;routing;sensor;tiling window manager;unbalanced circuit	Rik Sarkar;Wei Zeng;Jie Gao;Xianfeng Gu	2010		10.1145/1791212.1791240	conformal map;embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science	DB	8.875961746195305	75.32698966538825	155570

Code dissemination is in the spotlight as an important research issue since sensor nodes are necessary for updating new software remotely or fixing bugs dynamically. In particular, the time factor for code dissemination is the most important factor in order that the normal operation of nodes can be continuously performed as soon as finishing the dissemination is completed. For this factor, ECoDi determines the set of disseminators through regression analysis based on the size of distributed code and the time of past unicasts and broadcasts. Then it transmits the entire code as a unicast to multiple disseminators, and the disseminators broadcast the code to the remaining neighbor nodes immediately on receiving the first page. Performance results on our testbed show that ECoDi reduces the time of code dissemination significantly compared to a conventional code dissemination scheme. In commercial systems, it can support steady network operation with a shortened software upgrade time.	dbpedia;software bug;testbed;unicast	Sangwon Hyun;Mihui Kim	2011		10.1145/1968613.1968766	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;database;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.67488365533236	76.16600663964978	155596

Such networks have the capability of executing multiple tasks concurrently by allocating simply a fraction of their resources. Alternatively, many smaller wireless networks may collaborate to execute a larger, unforeseen application. In both cases a routing scheme other than the prevailing one may improve the efficiency of the task or the application being executed, reducing the energy consumption in the network. We posit that to fully tap into the potential of such networks a new routing infrastructure is needed, one that allows switching between different routing schemes dynamically as required by the applications being deployed, the conditions of the network as a whole and the existing locality information. We show in this paper how dynamic routing scheme selection can be achieved when sensor networks are overlaid with a virtual attribute based cluster hierarchy. We present analytical results for our scheme and show the expected improvement that can be achieved.	locality of reference;network packet;requirement;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);tree traversal	Wang Ke;Thomas D.

This property has evolved because female frogs are not able to correctly localize the male frogs when their calls are too close in time. A model for this behavior has been proposed in the literature. However, its use in technical applications is, so far, quite limited.  In this paper we implement the originally proposed model in sensor networks, with the aim of desynchronizing neighboring nodes as much as possible. Moreover, we propose extensions of the original model. Experimental results show that the proposed extensions improve the desynchronization capabilities of the original model.	self-organization	Hugo Hernández;Christian Blum	2011		10.1145/2001858.2002057	simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	6.973040998963161	77.93799618568461	156049

We propose a new mechanism, called relative contour, to evaluate topological features of underlying networks, particularly, for boundary recognition and skeleton extraction in an irregular sensor network. We further propose methods to identify boundary and skeleton of the network. The construction of relative contours and follow-up operations are carried out in distributed manner. Simulation results show that our methods perform well with complex topologies.	digital electronics;home automation;sensor;simulation	Yun Wang;Kai Li	2011	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2011.040121	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;visual sensor network	Mobile	6.815099777806282	77.51197176668549	156718

The network makes use of aggregation nodes, for compression, filtering, and/or data fusion of locally sensed data. Aggregation nodes (AGNs) then relay the traffic to mobile sinks. While aggregation may substantially reduce the overall traffic on the network, it may have the deleterious effect of concentrating loads on paths between AGNs and the sinks-such inhomogeneities in the energy burden may in turn lead to nodes with depleted energy reserves. To remedy this problem, we consider how one might achieve a more balanced energy burden across the network by spreading traffic, i.e., using a multiplicity of paths between AGNs and sinks. The proposed model reveals, how various aspects of the task at hand impact the characteristics of energy burdens on the network and in turn the lifetime for the system. We show that the scale of aggregation and degree of spreading can be optimized. Additionally, if the sensing activity involves large amounts of data flowing to sinks, then inhomogeneities in the energy burdens seen by nodes around the sinks will be hard to overcome, and indeed the network appears to scale poorly. By contrast, if the sensed data is bursty in space and time, then one can reap substantial benefits from aggregation and balancing.	active galactic nucleus;geometric modeling;relay;sensor	Seung Jun Baek;Gustavo de Veciana	2007	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.904970	simulation;wireless sensor network;information processing;telecommunications;computer science;sensor fusion;statistics	Mobile	7.741737163834282	78.13667640452148	157183

Existing efforts in this line highly depend on the boundary detection algorithms, which are used to extract accurate boundary nodes. One challenge is that in practical this could limit the applicability of the boundary detection algorithms. For instance, in low node density networks where boundary detection algorithms do not work well, the extracted boundary nodes are often incomplete. This paper brings a new view to skeleton extraction from a distance transform perspective, bridging the distance transform of the network and the incomplete boundaries. As such, we propose a distributed and scalable algorithm for skeleton extraction, called DIST, based on DIStance Transform, while incurring low communication overhead. The proposed algorithm does not require that the boundaries are complete or accurate, which makes the proposed algorithm more practical in applications. First, we compute the distance transform of the network. Specifically, the distance (hop count) of each node to the boundaries of a sensor network is estimated. The node map consisting of the distance values is considered as the distance transform (the distance map). The distance map is then used to identify skeleton nodes. Next, skeleton arcs are generated by controlled flooding within the identified skeleton nodes, thereby connecting these skeleton arcs, to extract a coarse skeleton. Finally, we refine the coarse skeleton by building shortest path trees followed by a prune phase. The obtained skeleton is robust to boundary noise or shape variations. Besides, we present two specific applications that benefit from the extracted skeleton: identifying complete boundaries and shape segmentation. First, with the extracted skeleton using DIST, we propose to identify more boundary nodes to form a meaningful boundary curve. Second, the utilization of the derived skeleton to segment the network into approximately convex pieces has been shown to be effective.	algorithm;approximation;bridging (networking);computer-aided software engineering;distance transform;map;overhead (computing);scalability;shortest path problem	Wenping Liu;Hongbo Jiang;Xiang Bai;Guang Tan;Chonggang Wang;Wenyu Liu;Kechao Cai	2013	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2012.300	distributed algorithm;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;topological skeleton	Mobile	6.707802687091163	77.77913476854387	157347

Since the mobile nodes have  limited battery power, it is very important to use energy efficiently in sensor networks. In order to maximize the lifetime  of sensor networks, traffic should be sent via a route that can avoid nodes with low energy thereby minimizing the total transmission  power. In addition, considering that the nodes of sensor networks are mobile, on-demand routing protocols are preferred for  sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel on-demand power aware routing algorithm supporting quality of service called  QDPRA. QDPRA prolongs its network lifetime by compromising between minimum energy consumption and fair energy consumption  without additional control packets. QDPRA also improves its data packet delivery ratio, minimizes delay and maximizes throughput  of the network.    	algorithm;quality of service;routing	Deepali Virmani;Satbir Jain	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12214-9_46	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile wireless sensor network;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	7.9302960180471445	81.50971109769368	157430

ENC translates the requirements of the application layer into messages that are diffused locally with the purpose of clustering multi-modal sensor nodes in the vicinity of an event and dynamically changing the local network topology, all to enhance the quality of the multimodal data fusion. ENC is implemented in NS-2 to show its applicability for tracking a mobile target in an urban scenario using a network of pressure, video, and magnetic sensors. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Hosts are assigned to base stations according to a probabilistic throughput function based on both the quality of the signal and the base station load. In order to optimize space coverage, base stations cluster hosts using a distributed clustering algorithm. Obstacles may interfere with transmission and obstruct base stations and hosts movement. To overcome this problem, we perform base stations repositioning making use of a motion planning algorithm on the visibility graph based on an extension of the bottleneck matching technique. We implemented the protocol on top of the NS2 simulator as an extension of the AODV. We tested it using both Random Way Point and Reference Point Group mobility models properly adapted to deal with obstacles. Experimental analysis shows that the protocol ensures the total space coverage together with a good throughput on the realistic model (Reference Point Group) outperforming both the standard AODV and DSR. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

RIP discovers the physical topological rings that exist in an arbitrary WSN topology and produces an infrastructure of concentric rings (Rings) that reflects the physical rings of nodes in the field. The resulting infrastructure guarantees the proximity of nodes. Neighbor nodes in this logical overlay are also physical neighbors. Each ring in Rings is assigned one or more mobile robots that act as probes to access the data and monitor the ring. Access nodes are selected dynamically at each ring to act as anchors for the probes visiting their associated rings. The Rings infrastructure supports both multi-hop and data-mule communication models with a high degree of reliability. This paper focuses on creating the infrastructure: we justify its correctness and efficiency. A rough cost model that predicts the cost of communication over Rings is provided. The performance of the infrastructure is evaluated by implementing and simulating some of the upper-layer processes. Simulation-based comparisons with the multi-scale communication approach are provided, and the results show that the Rings infrastructure is both robust and efficient in supporting upper-layer processes.	analysis of algorithms;correctness (computer science);data mule;html element;mobile robot;programming paradigm;rough set;simulation	Sonia Hashish	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2586464	mobile robot;communications protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;design methods;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.790899021693618	76.3523685240237	160322

We propose an algorithm that works with this chosen route to increase the probability of data reaching the sink node in the presence of communication failures. This is done using an algorithm that watches radio activity to detect when faults occur and then takes actions at the point of failure to re-route the data through a different node without starting over on an alternative path from the source. We show that we are able to increase the percentage of data received at the source node without increasing the energy consumption of the network beyond a reasonable level	adaptive algorithm;reliability engineering;routing	Michael Gregoire;Israel Koren	2007	Fifth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerComW'07)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.20	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	8.636630950007042	76.76764442570308	160468

However, the VANET may not guarantee timely detection of dangerous road conditions or maintain communication connectivity when the network density is low (e.g., in rural highways), which may pose as a big threat to driving safety. Towards addressing the problem, we propose to integrate the VANET with the inexpensive wireless sensor network (WSN). That is, sensor nodes are deployed along the roadside to sense road conditions, and to buffer and deliver information about dangerous conditions to vehicles regardless of the density or connectivity of the VANET. Along with the concept of VANET-WSN integration, new challenges arise and should be addressed. In this paper, we investigate these challenges and propose schemes for effective and efficient vehicle-sensor and sensor-sensor interactions. Prototype of the designed system has been implemented and tested in the field. Extensive simulations have also been conducted to evaluate the designed schemes. The results demonstrate various design tradeoffs, and indicate that satisfactory safety and energy efficiency can be achieved simultaneously when system parameters are appropriately chosen.	experiment;hoc (programming language);interaction;norm (social);prototype;sensor;simulation	Hua Qin;Yanfei Wang;Xuejia Lu;Wensheng Zhang;Guiling Wang	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)	10.1109/PERCOM.2010.5466988	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.042401862236658	74.95070882022014	160797

In a large scale deployment of sensor nodes, nodes require a significant fraction of battery energy for establishing and maintaining sensory data routing path from each node to a base station or sink node. In order to reduce the energy dissipation of nodes and thus prolong the lifetime of network, the study proposes an energy-efficient routing protocol, which combines a grid clustering strategy, a intra-cluster tree-based data collection, and a novel Hilbert chain over the cluster heads to reduce data transmission distance and to relax a lot of burden on topology control during the lifespan of the network. By computer simulation, the proposed protocol was shown to have better performance than other similar protocols in term of energy saving and network life time under the random deployment of nodes in wireless sensor networks.	cluster analysis;computer simulation;routing;sensor;software deployment;topology control	Yih-Chuan Lin;Jia-Hong Zhong	2012	2012 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 9th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.37	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;ant;network topology;computer network	Mobile	8.545839445068788	79.50591475779704	161454

The foremost disadvantage of presentation is limited duration because WSN contains only restricted battery energy at a node. Therefore, we anticipated cluster-related wireless energy transfer in this document. The foremost intention of the method is to augment the duration of the sensor network through charging by the help of this wireless power transfer technology. So that, mobile charging vehicle (MCV) is established to move within the network and charge the sensor node battery wireless. The sensor nodes in the network are collected as a cluster for energy efficiency. Here, the cluster head is chosen for each one cluster in the network which is based on the rank metric value. Suppose, if one node in the network is reducing its energy, then the CH will send charge request and route ID to the MCV. Afterward, the MCV recognize the node by means of the exacting route and establish to charge the node. The reproduction consequences illustrate that the network lifetime of our anticipated method is enhanced than obtainable method.		M. Dhurgadevi;P.

In this paper, we propose an efficient self-organizing data collection protocol, which addresses this challenge. Exploiting the knowledge of the underlying topology, the proposed approach uses a novel link acceptor, responsible for choosing the links to be added to the data routing structure, as well as, a next-hop selector taking into account energy information and the distance towards the sink. Using this information, the introduced next-hop selector allows a straightforward adjustment of the trade-off between preferring shorter routes or a higher degree of load balancing. Further, the amount of oscillations is minimized by using polarization functions and probabilistic next-hop selections.	acceptor (semiconductors);basis set (chemistry);classful network;link-state routing protocol;load balancing (computing);organizing (structure);polarization (waves);routing;self-organization	Peter Janacik;Emi Mathews;Dalimir Orfanus	2010	2010 IEEE 24th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2010.49	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;aerodynamics;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	8.537588624371562	79.05965946586521	161986

Current researches either focus on planning a mobile sink's moving trajectory in advance to achieve optimized network performance, or target at collecting a small portion of sensed data in the network. In many application scenarios, however, a mobile sink cannot move freely in the deployed area. Therefore, the precalculated trajectories may not be applicable. To avoid constant sink location update traffics when a sink's future locations cannot be scheduled in advance, we propose two energy-efficient proactive data reporting protocols, SinkTrail and SinkTrail-S, for mobile sink-based data collection. The proposed protocols feature low-complexity and reduced control overheads. Two unique aspects distinguish our approach from previous ones: 1) we allow sufficient flexibility in the movement of mobile sinks to dynamically adapt to various terrestrial changes; and 2) without requirements of GPS devices or predefined landmarks, SinkTrail establishes a logical coordinate system for routing and forwarding data packets, making it suitable for diverse application scenarios. We systematically analyze the impact of several design factors in the proposed algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms reduce control overheads and yield satisfactory performance in finding shorter routing paths.	global positioning system;greedy algorithm;network packet;network performance;requirement;routing;sensor;shortest path problem;simulation;terrestrial television	Xinxin Liu;Han Zhao;Xin Yang;Xiaolin Li	2013	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2011.207	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;mobile telephony;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;trajectory;operating system;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network;data collection	Mobile	9.023105153447691	78.23270968063828	162017

This paper proposes two schemes, one for general OLA transmission and one specifically for upstream routing in the topology of wireless sensor networks, that each save over 50% of the energy of flooding. The OLA-T scheme uses a transmission threshold to suppress nodes that would make weak contributions. The OLA Concentric Routing Algorithm (OLACRA) takes advantage of the concentric ring structure of broadcast OLAs to limit flooding on the upstream connection. Combination of these two schemes and variations of OLACRA are evaluated in terms of energy savings and probability of successful upstream routing.	algorithm;downstream (software development);hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);relay;routing;secret sharing;transmission (bittorrent client);upstream (software development);websphere optimized local adapters	Lakshmi V.

Due to the dynamic characteristics of MANETs, only a few algorithms have been proposed. Until recent years, these studies do not consider the more general h-out of-k mutual exclusion problem. In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm to solve the h-out of-k mutual exclusion problem in MANETs. The proposed algorithm has three benefits: (1) it improves the CS execution time by allowing at most k tokens to be concurrently dispatched; (2) it employs logical ring construction to adapt the token navigation to the system requirements; (3) it is designed with the consideration of the dynamical link formation characteristics in MANETs and is thus suitable for mobile environments. This paper shows its correctness. The proposed algorithm is also flexible for different token navigation policies to meet versatile MANET needs.	correctness (computer science);distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language);mutual exclusion;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);system requirements	Cheng-Zen Yang	2005	ITRE 2005. 3rd International Conference on Information Technology: Research and Education, 2005.	10.1109/ITRE.2005.1503069	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;suzuki-kasami algorithm;computer network	Robotics	4.1927690024596	78.59404289988333	162380

Many such devices are battery-operated, e.g., laptops, smart-phones and PDAs. Thus, their operational life-time before the battery should be recharged or replaced is limited. Among all subsystems operating inside these devices, wireless communication is accounted for the major consumption of power [1,2]. Additionally, platforms enabled with multiple wireless communication interfaces are becoming quite common. This turns the problem of efficient power usage by the wireless communication subsystem even more acute.	hoc (programming language)	Roy Friedman;Alex Kogan	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04355-0_52	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;service set;optimized link state routing protocol;wi-fi;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;wireless;computer network	Mobile	6.585022420588555	79.02610498481245	164311

Many VANET routing protocols have been proposed and operate well in the specific network they have been developed for such as dense or sparse networks but tend not to operate well or interoperate with different networks. This is a challenging requirement and we address this issue by proposing a (re-)configurable implementation that can adjust the behaviour of the protocol to different operating environments and application requirements. One possible way of achieving this is through a component-based architecture consisting of re-usable components that can be plugged in and out of the system. The paper illustrates how this componentization process can be carried out and how the given architecture is then configured to suit varying network states. The paper also identifies commonalities that exist across different routing protocols, leading up to the design of a generic component-based platform which can be used for VANET routing protocol development.	component-based software engineering;interoperability;requirement;routing;social network;sparse matrix	Vatsala Nundloll;Gordon S.

The obtained throughput expressions highlight the trade-off between achieving high throughput performance and improving the network security strength. The results reveal the importance of: (i) minimizing the number of hops in maximizing the throughput, and (ii) adopting routing diversity in combating malicious attacks and network failure conditions. We control the number of hops in data transmission through optimal topology design and active network deployment achieved by the mobile access point (MA). To combat routing attacks, we propose a secure routing path selection approach, and show the impact of the proposed approach on improving the throughput performance under malicious attacks.	ibm notes;multipath routing;network architecture;network security;shortest path problem;software deployment;throughput;wireless access point	Mai Abdelhakim;Jian Ren;Tongtong Li	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037536	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;throughput;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;mobile telephony;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.8718551396523426	81.07952717546956	164793
201a3d941e913acf3d125e463f0392f3123fdc57	mdaral: a multi-radio version for the daral routing algorithm	multi radio;ieee 802 15 4;wsn;info eu repo semantics article;daral;smart city;network routing algorithm	Smart Cities are called to change the daily life of human beings. This concept permits improving the efficiency of our cities in several areas such as the use of water, energy consumption, waste treatment, and mobility both for people as well as vehicles throughout the city. This represents an interconnected scenario in which thousands of embedded devices need to work in a collaborative way both for sensing and modifying the environment properly. Under this scenario, the majority of devices will use wireless protocols for communicating among them, representing a challenge for optimizing the use of the electromagnetic spectrum. When the density of deployed nodes increases, the competition for using the physical medium becomes harder and, in consequence, traffic collisions will be higher, affecting data-rates in the communication process. This work presents mDARAL, a multi-radio routing algorithm based on the Dynamic and Adaptive Radio Algorithm (DARAL), which has the capability of isolating groups of nodes into sub-networks. The nodes of each sub-network will communicate among them using a dedicated radio frequency, thus isolating the use of the radio channel to a reduced number of nodes. Each sub-network will have a master node with two physical radios, one for communicating with its neighbours and the other for being the contact point among its group and other sub-networks. The communication among sub-networks is done through master nodes in a dedicated radio frequency. The algorithm works to maximize the overall performance of the network through the distribution of the traffic messages into unoccupied frequencies. The obtained results show that mDARAL achieves great improvement in terms of the number of control messages necessary to connect a node to the network, convergence time and energy consumption during the connection phase compared to DARAL.	convergence (action);electromagnetic spectrum;embedded system;embedding;isolate compound;license;node - plant part;numerous;protocols documentation;radio communications;radio frequency;routing;smart city;subnetwork;technological convergence;algorithm;collision;message	Francisco J.

This is needed to reduce battery replacement costs. At the same time, the information transmitted to the sink has to be good enough in order to make timely decisions on the environmental hazards being monitored. Sensor algorithms have to thus balance quality of information with energy consumption. We introduce in this paper an algorithm that uses multiagent co-ordination technology to organize the sensors in coalitions that share the burden of sensing and communicating. We provide experimental evidence of a good balance between information quality and energy consumption on a simulated river pollution phenomenon.	agent-based model;algorithm;information quality;multi-agent system;network performance;network topology;peer-to-peer;principle of good enough;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);self-organization;sensor	Maria del Carmen Delgado-Roman;Carles Sierra	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39860-5_4	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security	Embedded	9.486980835955494	76.66684832060916	165367

A plethora of routing algorithms have been proposed to support path discovery into this class of networks, ranging from broadcasting/flooding approaches to global positioning systems (GPS). W-Grid is a novel infrastructure whose self-organizing routing and localization services enable message routing and data management without reliance on flooding/broadcasting operations or GPS. The resulting ad-hoc network does not suffer from the dead-end problem, which occurs in geographic-based routing when a node is unable to locate a neighbor closer to the destination than itself. As an example of data management we present a location service that allows a device to send messages to any another node without knowing its position. Extensive performance analysis and experiments have been conducted, and the results compared to GPSR, which is considered to be the most efficient solution not using broadcast operations but exploiting nodes' position. Analyses show that the difference between the performance of our approach and GPSR is minimal and therefore very interesting, since no GPS is used	apl;approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;centralized computing;computer;distributed computing;distributed database;experiment;global positioning system;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);internationalization and localization;location-based service;organizing (structure);personal digital assistant;programming paradigm;self-organization;sensor;tree structure	Gianluca Moro;Gabriele Monti;Aris M.

Most existing coverage and connectivity algorithms work to form tree networks when sensor nodes do not have location information of themselves. However, a tree topology network does not perform well in terms of energy efficiency and scalability if compared with a cluster network. In this paper, a novel topology control algorithm called Adaptive Random Clustering (ARC) is proposed to form a cluster network with required coverage and connectivity without location information. The performance of its coverage intensity and connectivity is analyzed based on the characteristics of cluster topology, and their proper parameters are determined. ARC inherits an excellent energy efficiency from cluster topology and avoids the collisions and overhearing of data packets. A good scalability can be achieved as only a limited number of channels are needed in ARC for a large-scale network. Furthermore, ARC can adjust the number of active nodes adaptively according to the required coverage to balance the energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that required coverage and connectivity can be satisfied and network lifetime is prolonged significantly.

TCP/IP flow control, addressing, and packet fragmentation are adapted in a gateway that relays TCP/IP communication to WSN. The performance of TCP/IP is evaluated between endpoint PCs communicating over TUTWSN (Tampere University of Technology WSN), which is used as a transparent communication medium for TCP/IP data. The evaluation results show that the window-based flow control algorithms of TCP perform too aggressively in WSNs, where random bit errors and topology changes are main reasons for errors instead of congestion. Further, a frequent duty cycle is needed in WSN to compensate the TCP/IP overhead. In TUTWSN, compared to an environmental monitoring application with two second activity cycle and native WSN transport, the enabling of TCP/IP consumes five times more power	algorithm;communication endpoint;duty cycle;experiment;flow control (data);fragmentation (computing);internet protocol suite;low-power broadcasting;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);relay	Mauri Kuorilehto;Jukka Suhonen;Mikko Kohvakka;Marko Hännikäinen;Timo Hämäläinen	2006	2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2006.254157	nagle's algorithm;tcp westwood;compound tcp;radio link protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;computer science;windows vista networking technologies;tcp offload engine;tcp hole punching;optical ip switching;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;environmental monitoring;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Mobile	4.548175741215367	81.22113127910934	166354

A surface sink is usually deployed at a pre-specified location to maximize one or more performance metrics. However, when the network is dynamic, a redeployment of surface sink should be considered to reduce the effect of mobility on the network performance. Redeployment can be done periodically, at times based on a mobility prediction models, or adaptively based on performance degradation. Unnecessary redeployment can result from using the periodic or prediction based redeployment. In this paper we present an adaptive dynamic sink redeployment strategy that enforces redeployment only if a reduction in energy consumption is guaranteed. The redeployment decision is based on routing information collected at the surface sink throughout network operation. We use a location unaware routing protocol “adaptive power controlled routing protocol” as the underlying routing strategy. When the mobility of the network is not severe, nodes tend to use a fixed power level to communicate with neighboring nodes or surface sink. However, if more nodes are switching to use higher power levels for communication and the energy consumption is increased a sink redeployment procedure is started. Surface sink then triggers localization and finds the optimal new location of surface sink to minimize total energy consumption. Simulation results show that adaptive sink redeployment achieves a considerable reduction in energy consumption.	elegant degradation;internationalization and localization;network performance;routing;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Manal Al-Bzoor;Yibo Zhu;Jun Liu;Reda A.

15ada0e6122dfc7919393f0b51422039c6799c1b	a cooperation-based approach to energy optimization in wireless ad hoc networks		A well known and still open issue for wireless ad hoc networks is the unfair energy consumption among the nodes. The specific position of certain nodes composing an ad hoc network makes them more involved in network operations than others, causing a faster drain of their energy. To better distribute the energy level and increase the lifetime of the whole network, we propose to periodically force the cooperation of less cooperative nodes while overwhelmed ones deliberately stop their service. A dedicated ad hoc network routing protocol is introduced to discover alternative paths without degradation in the overall network performance.

In this algorithm, the energy heterogeneity of the nodes is fully reflected in the mechanism of cluster-heads’ election. It optimizes the competition radius of the cluster-heads according to the residual energy of the nodes. This kind of uneven clustering prolongs the lifetime of the cluster-heads with lower residual energies or near the sink nodes. In data transmission stage, the hybrid multihop transmission mode is adopted, and the next-hop routing election fully takes account of the factors of residual energies and the distances among the nodes. The simulation results show that the introduction of an uneven clustering mechanism and the optimization of competition radius of the cluster-heads significantly prolonged the lifetime of the network and improved the efficiency of data transmission.

One of the key elements of the Smart Grid is the Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) which is expected to facilitate the transport of meter readings from meters to the utility provider and control information (potentially) in the other direction. Different solution strategies for realizing AMI networks are currently being debated in the community with no clear consensus so far. This paper proposes a mesh radio based solution which exhibits self-organizing characteristics and is therefore attractive from a deployment perspective. The proposed solution has been realized as enhancements to the RPL protocol, a connectivity enabling mechanism for low power and lossy networks currently being standardized by the IETF ROLL working group. It enables smart meter nodes augmented with the mesh radio to automatically discover concentrator nodes in the vicinity, setup a single/multi-hop link to the best available concentrator, detect loss of connectivity and subsequently re-configure itself to re-establish connectivity so as to ensure reliable transport of smart metering data. Moreover, it achieves this in a distributed manner thereby ensuring scalability. Results from the evaluation of the proposed solution through emulation based experiments further confirm this.	downtime;emulator;experiment;lossy compression;mesh networking;organizing (structure);scalability;self-organization;smart meter;software deployment	Parag Kulkarni;Sedat Gormus;Zhong Fan;Benjamin Motz	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986178	telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.8265900207029078	77.49963707334707	168413

BIMAS handles the energy issues by exploiting mobile agents that communicates with static sensor nodes and forwards sensed data to a base station. The introduction of mobile agents brings benefit in terms of shifting routing issues away from sensor nodes to mobile agents. The advantage of BIMAs can be shown in terms of efficient energy resources, fault tolerance and efficient handling of hole problems.	agent-based model;anomaly detection;fault tolerance;habitat;mobile agent;routing;sensor	Vasaki Ponnusamy;Azween Abdullah	2010	2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Environments	10.1109/IE.2010.46	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Robotics	7.140660244052452	76.21049711613787	169109

Ad hoc wireless networks are increasing in popularity, because of the spread of laptops, sensor devices, personal digital assistants, and other mobile electronic devices. These devices will eventually need to communicate with each other, without an adequate infrastructure to rely on. For mobile ad hoc networks, the complexity of routing increases because of its characteristics such as dynamic topology, absence of centralized authority, time varying quality of service (QoS) requirements, etc. The biggest challenge in this kind of networks is to find a path between communication end points satisfying user’s QoS requirement in spite of frequent path failures because of node mobility. Recent advances in wireless technology and availability of mobile computing devices with networking capabilities have generated a lot of interest in wireless ad hoc networks for QoS-based real-time multimedia applications. In this article, we are proposing AMQR, an ant-based multiobjective on demand QoS routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc network which will be highly adaptive, efficient, scalable, and mainly reduces end-to-end delay in high mobility cases.	algorithm;ant colony;centralized computing;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);laptop;mobile computing;personal digital assistant;quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;routing;scalability	Perumalsamy Deepalakshmi;Shanmugasundaram Radhakrishnan	2011	EURASIP J.

The aim of our adaptive approach is to detect the critical event, such a fire detection in the forest, at the required delay with minimum energy consumption. So, when an event occurs, only the sensor nodes in the detection area will be in active mode, while the others will be in sleep mode. The reaction to the event is made locally. This behavior can consume less energy. The simulation results show that our adaptive approach is better than the non-adaptive approach. We have compared our results to other works and we have proved the efficiency of our approach in terms of energy consumption.	cluster analysis;mathematical optimization;original chip set;sensor;simulation;sleep mode;software propagation;the forest	Salsabil Gherairi;Sofiane Ouni;Farouk Kamoun	2014	Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking, ComNet-2014	10.1109/ComNet.2014.6840912	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Robotics	9.811522416294022	81.33077492694646	170041

This can be overhead intense and can reduce spatial reuse. Maintaining directional information with regards to a large number of neighbors can itself be expensive; therefore it is important to limit a node's degree. We propose a topology control scheme (Di-ATC) that works with fully directional communications and offers a low degree bound while preserving network connectivity. The key idea is to execute Di-ATC on the discovered neighbors to select and maintain connectivity with only a subset of these neighbors. The members of this subset are those with high angular separations.

f32574de74f8fd40a8c80fae455b1c2b567562ee	a hybrid swarm optimization for energy efficient clustering in multi-hop wireless sensor network		Wireless sensor network refers to distributed sets of embedded devices, all of them having processing units, wireless transmission interface and sensors or actuators. Data accumulation through effective network organizations helps nodes to be split into small sets known as clusters. This grouping of sensor nodes as clusters is known as clustering. All clusters have leaders known as cluster heads (CHs). Clustering networks for minimizing total distance is an NP-hard issue. For a particular network topology, it is hard to discover optimum quantity of cluster-heads as well as their positions. The current article suggests a hybrid differential evolution with multi objective bee swam optimization (MOBSO-DE) for efficient clustering. CH selection process is based on communication energy and factors like residual energy and energy constraint metric. Simulation shows that the new MOBSO-DE method outperformed LEACH and MOBSO for packet delivery ratio and network lifetime.	swarm	Rajendra Prasad;P. V. Naganjaneyulu;K.

Each mobile node determines its own transmission power based only on local information. The proposed algorithm first constructs the constrained Gabriel graph from the given unit disk graph and then reduces the total transmission power by allowing each node individually excises some replaceable links. The constructed topology is sparse, has a constant bounded power stretch factor, and the total transmission power is lower than those obtained from other proposed algorithms. In addition, compared with others, our algorithm requires lower time complexity to generate a solution, and can thus further save the energy for each mobile node. We demonstrate the performance improvements of our algorithm through simulations.	algorithm;computation;distributed algorithm;global communications conference;hoc (programming language);internationalization and localization;logical topology;mobile computing;routing;session (computer science);simulation;sparse matrix;time complexity;topology control;unit disk graph	Szu-Chi Wang;David S.

Due to the peculiarities of this communication channel (such as, very short range of transmission (under lm), high interference, high path loss) and limited capabilities of nano-nodes (such as, computing, sensing, memory, energy), the existing ranging techniques designed for traditional wireless sensor networks are not longer used in the WNSNs. In this paper, two ranging algorithms based on hop-counting methods are developed to estimate the location of every nanosensor within certain area and distance between nodes in the networks. The first technique uses flooding mechanism to forward the packets to all nodes in the networks and count number of hops between two measured nodes. To overcome the problems of high overhead, duplication packets, and waste of consumption energy, the second algorithm based on clusters is developed. In this way, all sensornodes are grouped into different clusters. Cluster heads will communicate together and count the number of hops. The performance of the algorithms are analyzed in terms of estimated distance, delay by taking also account the energy constrains of nanosensors. The simulation results show that, by being aware of the limitations of nanosensors, the proposed protocols are able to support WNSNs with very high density in ranging and localizing.	algorithm;channel (communications);frequency band;gnu nano;interference (communication);list of wireless mice with nano receivers;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation	Hoa Tran-Dang;Nicolas Krommenacker;Patrick Charpentier	2014	2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275496	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	9.18203797524598	81.23898104442874	171660

Their low cost and the wide range of applications where wireless sensor networks can be applied, make them an important research and commercial field in the short term. Furthermore, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for physical and MAC layer in addition with the Zigbee specification for the network and application layer, are an enforcement for WSNs. Much research in WSNs related topics such as energy-aware, MAC protocols, routing protocols, security, location, etc is being carried out nowadays. An open issue is the interconnection between wireless sensor networks where different approaches can be adopted: bridging (extension devices) and proxying (mainly middleware entities). This paper is focused in the bridging approach for Zigbee networks. Our objective is to establish a Zigbee Extension Device Network for the case where the different clusters can not be connected to the same Zigbee network by using the multihop routing protocol defined in Zigbee. A Zigbee cluster is a set of Zigbee nodes. This paper introduces three different solutions to join the disconnected clusters of the Zigbee Network: a central approach (based on the use of a central station) and two distributed approaches; one of them proposes that each Zigbee Extension Device stores the information of all the other Extension Devices within the network while the other uses a P2P Zigbee Extension Device Overlay Network to join the disconnected Zigbee Clusters. The paper includes the analysis of each solution and the comparison among them.

This topology control algorithm assumes a small number of sensor nodes connected to a single sink and communicating using a TDMA-based MAC protocol designed with the application requirements in mind. Our solution was implemented and evaluated in real testbed inside an oil refinery. Evaluation results demonstrating the self-organizing properties of the proposed mechanism, as well as its operational performance are included.

c05d63e4423515810d3a725ec626388af20fe212	an efficient implementation of the greedy forwarding strategy		A wireless sensor network needs a suitable multihop routing protocol to facilitate the communication between arbitrary sensor nodes. Position-based routing protocols are attractive for large-scale sensor networks due to their location awareness and scalability. A large number of position-based routing protocols use the greedy forwarding strategy. This paper presents an efficient implementation of the greedy forwarding algorithm. The nodes of the sensor network are viewed as points in the plane. Each node uses a Voronoi Diagram to generate a subdivision of the plane, which is solely based upon its local neighborhood. Every node forwards incoming messages to that Voronoi Cell the destination node belongs to, according to its position information. The complexity of our solution is O(n log n) for computing the Voronoi Diagram, which is typically done only once, but only O(log n) for finding the next-hop node. Interestingly, n is not the total number of nodes in the network here, but only the number of single hop neighbors.	geographic routing;greedy algorithm;location awareness;scalability;subdivision surface;voronoi diagram	Hannes Stratil	2004			computer science	Mobile	3.822516357273038	79.65571433291663	172444

Most proposed algorithms employ hierarchical communication structures that may be expensive to maintain when nodes are mobile and network topologies are dynamic. Interval-based synchronization has been proposed as particularly suited for sensor networks, as it does not require any particular communication pattern. In this paper, we show that node mobility puts no burden on interval-based synchronization, but actually helps it. This is not the case for time-estimate-based approaches that rely on specific communication patterns. Mobility resilience therefore further strengthens the case of interval-based clock synchronization for ad-hoc sensor networks	algorithm;clock synchronization;expect;hoc (programming language);maximal set;network topology;overhead (computing);simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Lennart Meier;Philipp Blum;Lothar Thiele	2005	IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems Conference, 2005.	10.1109/MAHSS.2005.1542844	clock synchronization;synchronization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;data synchronization;synchronization;computer network	Robotics	6.027115816775862	78.99217980056946	172516

This paper addresses the problem of finding the optimal solution. It shows first steps like the moving of operators and the modification of the epoch duration. The primary goal is to prolong the lifetime of the sensor network. A QoS-based goal function is introduced, and the optimization process is explained.

In the presence of obstacles, the efficiency of routing algorithms is increased by voluntarily avoiding some regions in the vicinity of obstacles, areas which we call dead-ends. In this paper, we first propose a fast convergent routing algorithm with proactive dead-ends detection together with a formal definition and description of dead-ends. Secondly, we present a generalization of this algorithm which improves performances in all to many and all to all traffic patterns. In a third part we prove that this algorithm is optimal up to a constant factor as we prove it computes path whose length is at most 2π + 1 times longer than the shortest path. In a fourth part we consider the reactive version of the algorithm which is an extension of a previously known early obstacle detection algorithm. Finally we give experimental results to illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms in different scenarios.	algorithm;apollonian network;distributed algorithm;performance;recursion;routing;shortest path problem	Florian Huc;Aubin Jarry;Pierre Leone;Lumini&#x0163;a Moraru;Sotiris E.

Many applications based on these WSNs consider local clocks at each sensor node that need to be synchronized to a common notion of time. In this context, the majority of previous researches were focused on the study of protocols, and algorithms that address these issues in order to resolve synchronization problems. Previous fforts and empirical studies in wireless sensor network (WSN) proposed several solutions (algorithms). The focus of this this paperis to examine and evaluate the most important synchronization algorithms based on thepositionsof variousquantitative and qualitative synchronization protocolsfor energy-efficient information processing and routing in WSNs.	algorithm;clock synchronization;information processing;palette (computing);routing;sensor node	Salim el Khediri;Nejah Nasri;Mounir Samet;Anne Wei;Abdennaceur Kachouri	2012	CoRR		real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	6.7132473317113055	78.97648089138309	173625
52c2085b593fa28cd0699c1879d3a241fbc37024	a survey on power aware routing protocols for mobile ad-hoc network		The Mobile Ad-Hoc network is a growing type of wireless network characterized by decentralized and dynamic topology. One of the main challenges in Mobile Ad-Hoc networks (MANETs) is that it has very limited power supply. To overcome the challenge, there are several power-aware routing protocols that have been developed in recent years. This paper describes a survey on some of those energy aware routing protocols for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks. The first category of power aware protocol schemes minimizes the total transmission power and the second category of schemes tries to increase the remaining battery level of every individual node to increase the lifetime of the entire network. The optimizations between these two objectives are important issues in power aware routing. This discussion focuses on different power saving algorithms and their development and modifications. After analyzing the existing works it has been seen that there are still several fields (using a dual threshold, passive energy saving etc) where we can give more focus in the future.	routing	Samrat Sarkar;Koushik Majumder	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02931-3_35	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;distance-vector routing protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;routing information protocol	Mobile	7.252582892757923	81.06023107393386	173722

Although cluster routing schemes are characterized by their low overhead and efficiency in reliable data transfer in traditional wireless sensor network, this potential is still yet to be utilized for viable routing options in the environment with obstacles and voids, via greedy and perimeter forwarding. In this paper, a novel Grid-Based Reliable Routing (GBRR) technique is presented. This is achieved by the creation of virtual clusters based on square grids from which the next hop choice is made based on intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication quality. The simulation result shows that the developed scheme can make more advancement to the BS as against the usual decisions of relevant clustering route select operations, while ensuring channel quality. Further simulation results have shown the enhanced reliability, lower latency and energy efficiency of the presented scheme with randomly nodes and obstacles distribution.	randomness;routing	Xiaoliang Meng;Xiaochuan Shi;Zi Wang;Shuang Wu;Chenglin Li	2016	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2016.08.004	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;probability distribution;routing table;embedded system;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;greedy algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;cluster analysis;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;statistics;computer network	Mobile	7.829197950008391	80.51074758207771	174065

d1c4f6d63ef9de18c7c0695feff1ff03daf1ecd4	adaptive hierarchical network structures for wireless sensor networks		Clustering is a crucial network design approach to enable large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployments. A large variety of clustering approaches has been presented focusing on various aspect such as minimizing communication overhead, controlling the network topology etc. Simulations on such protocols are performed using theoretical models that are based on unrealistic assumptions like ideal wireless communication channels and perfect energy consumption estimations. With these assumptions taken for granted, theoretical models claim various performance milestones that cannot be achieved in realistic conditions. In this paper, we design a new clustering protocol that adapts to the changes in the environment and the needs and goals of the user applications. We provide a protocol that is deployable protocol in real WSNs. We apply our protocol in multiple indoors wireless sensor testbeds with multiple experimental scenarios to showcase scalability and trade-offs between network properties and configurable protocol parameters. By analysis of the real world experimental output, we present results that depict a more realistic view of the clustering problem, regarding adapting to environmental conditions and the quality of topology control. Our study clearly demonstrates the applicability of our approach and the benefits it offers to both research & development communities.	algorithm;application domain;cluster analysis;computer simulation;experiment;network planning and design;network topology;overhead (computing);scalability;testbed;topology control	Dimitrios Amaxilatis;Ioannis Chatzigiannakis;Shlomi Dolev;Christos Koninis;Apostolos Pyrgelis;Paul G.

This is necessary, with a random placement, to avoid loss of coverage or connectivity. However, communicating through remote neighbors requires more energy, which can be a severe disadvantage since energy is often critical in this type of network. By comparing two-ranges, one to ensure coverage and one to save energy, we identify link-nodes which play an essential role to keep the network connected. Characterizing these nodes and their occurrence in communication routes will help to save energy and increase lifetime of the overall network. Without precautions, these link-nodes receive a high traffic load. Using simulations we find that slightly longer routes can avoid link-nodes and thus reduce average energy consumption. Network lifetime can be extended by identifying these nodes at startup and reducing their energy consumption wherever possible.	code coverage;node (computer science);simulation	Oscar John Gerald Somsen	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1165-1	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.62396364387483	80.2092274403315	175217

For scalability and efficiency, it is important to keep the maximum node degree of the overlay in the publish/subscribe system low. Ideally one would like to be able not only to keep the maximum node degree of the overlay low, but also to ensure that the network has low diameter. We address this problem by presenting Topic Distribution Constant Diameter Overlay Design Algorithm (TD-CD-ODA) that achieves a minimal maximum node degree in a low-diameter setting. We have shown experimentally that the algorithm performs well in both targets in comparison to the other overlay design algorithms.	algorithm;experiment;internet of things;overlay network;publish–subscribe pattern;scalability;social network	Kasim Oztoprak;Sina Layazali;Erdogan Dogdu	2017	2017 IEEE 11th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)	10.1109/ICSC.2017.88	overlay network;computer science;theoretical computer science;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;computer network	DB	8.36090146590185	74.69795802037842	175468

They gather and disseminate local data using multi-hop broadcasting. WSN design and deployment is hampered by currently limited knowledge of the performance characteristics of network nodes and protocols. Their systematic development, thus, requires a flexible simulation environment in which new models of specific node or network behaviours can be integrated easily. This paper introduces a loosely coupled, object oriented simulation environment for this task. The simulator is used to investigate the efficiency of flooding protocols in WSNs. For dense networks with noisy transmission, we show that using low transmission power maximizes time and resource efficiency and that the scalability of flooding for large networks is excellent. We demonstrate ways of improving flooding performance given specific deployment constraints.	loose coupling;scalability;sensor web;simulation;software deployment	Patrick Downey;Rachel Cardell-Oliver	2004	International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks, 2004	10.1109/DSN.2004.1311949	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	4.025959661160015	74.66873361390276	175960

Many applications including environment monitoring use a clustering approach for efficient energy consumption. LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is the most famous one of clustering protocols, which enables the balanced consumption of energy to prolong network lifetime. In LEACH, however, additional energy and time are consumed to reform clusters at the setup phase of every round. This side effect is worse as the number of clusters increases. This paper presents a novel energy-efficient clustering scheme to remove cluster reforming process required at every round after the first round, which is called COTS (Clustering with One Time Setup). The proposed COTS allows that the role of cluster head is rotated among members in a cluster without cluster reforming process. This significantly saves the energy because the cluster reforming process is not necessary, resulting in increased network lifetime. According to our simulation study, the network performance and lifetime are improved much better as the number of clusters is increased.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;network performance;sensor;simulation;solaris cluster	Heewook Shin;Sangman Moh;Ilyong Chung	2012	2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSyN.2012.22	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	9.082874542753515	80.52390564735596	176015

These are localized algorithms that guarantee the delivery for connected ad hoc and sensor wireless networks modeled by arbitrary graphs, including inaccurate location information for a destination node. This paper first optimizes an existing DFS based routing scheme by eliminating from the candidate list neighbors whose messages to other nodes were overheard. We then introduce a new set of localized routing algorithms. The new DFS routing protocol is integrated with power metrics minimizing total power for routing of a message. These DFS Power Progress based algorithms are combinations of known greedy power ad DFS routing algorithms. All algorithms are further enhanced by applying the concept of connected dominating sets, which greatly reduced the search path without impacting significantly the length of effectively constructed path for real tragic. Experiments confirm the efficiency of the new enhanced DFS, power aware and connected dominating set based routing algorithms and ability to guarantee the delivery in arbitrary model due to the DFS routing framework.	connected dominating set;depth-first search;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;lu decomposition;path (variable);routing	Bosko Vukojevic;Nishith Goel;Kalai Kalaichelvan;Amiya Nayak;Ivan Stojmenovic	2007	2007 9th IFIP International Conference on Mobile Wireless Communications Networks	10.1109/ICMWCN.2007.4668197	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;graph theory;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.594005022519447	80.20270309176165	176030

A stepping stone to centralized network control is to build and maintain a complete network topology model that scales and reacts to the network dynamics that occur in low-power wireless networks. We propose SMOG as a mechanism to build and maintain a centralized full network topology model using probabilistic data structures. Extensive analysis of the proposed approach in both simulation and two testbeds shows that SMOG can build a complete model of a WSN of over 100 nodes with 98% accuracy in less than four minutes. Our approach also offers fast recovery from heavy network interference, recovering model accuracy to 98% in less than two and a half minutes.	block cipher mode of operation;bloom filter;centralized computing;crazy stone (software);data structure;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;network topology;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;stepping level;testbed	Pablo Corbalan;Ramona Marfievici;Victor Cionca;Donna O'Shea;Dirk Pesch	2016	2016 IEEE 13th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)	10.1109/MASS.2016.025	data modeling;network architecture;wireless sensor network;network management station;data structure;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;network simulation;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;probabilistic logic;network topology;statistics;computer network	Mobile	7.546130492482611	78.1660274948242	176504

To couple the network with real world tightly, we provide a network-wide time synchronization through the introduction of abstractions for cluster and hierarchy. Generally the error of time synchronization has the tendency of being accumulated as the hop count along the synchronization path increases in multi-hop wireless sensor network. Thus we cluster the randomly deployed nodes to decrease the hop count along the synchronization path. We then apply different optimal synchronization mechanisms to the cluster heads and cluster members for the sake of power efficiency through an explicit broadcast manner. We prove the performance enhancements with simulation comparisons.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;hierarchical clustering;performance per watt;randomness;simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Hyunhak Kim;Daeyoung Kim;Seongeun Yoo	2006	20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)	10.1109/AINA.2006.125	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;data synchronization;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	7.783321906290323	79.56936861546667	177241

Network clustering and event-driven protocols are two main approaches typically used to fulfill those requirements. Existing techniques are either focused only on performance of clusterheads or too restricted to specific applications; however, few of previous work took advantage of the combination of both approaches. In this paper, we formalize the combined problem of network clustering in an event-driven manner, show its NP-Completeness and present an innovative distributed heuristic solution. We hereby propose AWARE, an event-driven and energy-aware network clustering technique. AWARE groups highly active nodes together and thus make clusterheads report more efficiently with only relevant data. This approach guarantees the benefit of both reduced energy consumption and aggregated highly relevant data. Furthermore, AWARE is not only able to recover from node failures for in-network communication, but also provides a communication structure for high level services. We theoretically prove that AWARE indeed provides the solution to the problem, as it completes in constant time, forms connected clusters and can recover from node failures. Finally, our extensive performance studies also validate the effectiveness and efficiency of AWARE.	cluster analysis;event-driven architecture;event-driven programming;heuristic;high-level programming language;np-completeness;relevance;requirement;time complexity	Iñigo Urteaga;Na Yu;Nicholas Hubbell;Qi Han	2011	2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2011.6115521	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	DB	8.645341649322159	77.28336032159007	177678

Our simulation indicates that we always formulate power aware dominating sets using our method. The dominating sets we obtain are in general smaller in size compared to the same obtained by Wu et al. (2001). We manage to route more packets compared to Butenko et al. (2004) as we use power aware feature and look for alternative power aware dominating sets once energy levels of some of the nodes of our initial dominating set fall below certain threshold. We could ensure mobility support in our algorithm and under the condition of mobility obtain better lifespan using our algorithm compared to the one that has no power aware feature. To handle small topology changes due to switching on/off actions of mobile hosts we proposed a localized algorithm for maintaining the connected power aware dominating set.	connected dominating set;distributed algorithm;energy level;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);resultant;router (computing);routing;simulation	Tamaghna Acharya;Rajarshi Roy	2005	2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW'05)	10.1109/ICPPW.2005.28	wireless ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;connected dominating set;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	6.268767733075044	80.15927580294236	177979

The routing protocol should be able to provide uniform power dissipation during transmission to the sink node. In this paper, we present a self-optimization scheme for WSNs which is able to utilize and optimize the sensor nodes' resources, especially the batteries, to achieve balanced energy consumption across all sensor nodes. This method is based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic which is adopted to enhance the paths with the best quality function. The assessment of this function depends on multi-criteria metrics such as the minimum residual battery power, hop count and average energy of both route and network. This method also distributes the traffic load of sensor nodes throughout the WSN leading to reduced energy usage, extended network life time and reduced packet loss. Simulation results show that our scheme performs much better than the Energy Efficient Ant-Based Routing (EEABR) in terms of energy consumption, balancing and efficiency.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;ants;cylinder-head-sector;decision making;depletion region;entity name part qualifier - adopted;equilibrium;experiment;hearing loss, high-frequency;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;network packet;neuronal calcium-sensor proteins;node - plant part;numerous;one thousand;optimizing compiler;overhead (computing);protocols documentation;quality of service;routing;sensor web;simulation;upwind scheme	Ahmed M.

The research builds on extant work on wireless sensor node clustering by reporting on: (1) the development of a novel distributed management approach for tracking mobile nodes in an industrial wireless sensor network; and (2) an objective comparison of alternative cluster management approaches for wireless sensor networks. To perform this comparison, we focus on two main clustering approaches proposed in the literature: pre-defined clusters and ad hoc clusters. These approaches are compared in the context of their reconfigurability: more specifically, we investigate the trade-off between the cost and the effectiveness of competing strategies aimed at adapting to changes in the sensing environment. To support this work, we introduce three new metrics: a cost/efficiency measure, a performance measure, and a resource consumption measure. The results of our experiments show that ad hoc clusters adapt more readily to changes in the sensing environment, but this higher level of adaptability is at the cost of overall efficiency.	cluster analysis;cluster manager;experiment;hoc (programming language);node - plant part;reconfigurability;sensor node;statistical cluster	Mohammad Gholami;Robert W.

To investigate these dependencies in detail we conducted various simulations on connectivity. In this paper we first introduce the application scenario and discuss the impact of the different parameters and their interrelations. We then present the simulation results and discuss their consequences for the application design.	marathon;simulation	Dennis Pfisterer;Martin Lipphardt;Carsten Buschmann;Horst Hellbrück;Stefan Fischer;Jan Hendrik Sauselin	2006		10.1145/1142680.1142696	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;distributed computing	Mobile	7.274279020829671	76.73038074987765	180026

Often, the aftermath of such an event is the creation of a network of bridged fragments where connectivity is maintained by one or several bridge nodes. These networks are vulnerable, because the bridge nodes will soon exhaust their energy resources leading to the fragmentation of the network. This paper describes a bridge protection algorithm (BPA), a combination of techniques which, in response to a catastrophic event, change the behavior of a set of topologically important nodes in the network. These techniques protect the bridge node by letting some nodes take over some of the responsibilities of the sink. At the same time, they relieve some other overwhelmed nodes and prevent the apparition of additional bridge nodes. To achieve this, the algorithm sacrifices the length of some routes in order to distribute routes away from critical areas. In a variation on the BPA algorithm, we show that if geographic information about the nodes is available, replacing shortest path routing with a routing model which follows the edges of the relational neighborhood graph will lead to further improvements in the expected connected lifetime of the network.	algorithm;catastrophe theory;fault tolerance;fork (software development);half-life 2: episode one;network topology;oracle bpa suite;routing;shortest path problem;simulation	Saad Ahmad Khan;Ladislau Bölöni;Damla Turgut	2015	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2014.08.016	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.93045370793735	78.14206018988696	180211

The objective of the DST protocol is to timely and reliably transport event features from the sensor field to the sink with minimum energy consumption. In this regard, the DST protocol simultaneously addresses congestion control and timely event transport reliability objectives in WSN. In addition to its efficient congestion detection and control algorithms, it incorporates the time critical event first (TCEF) scheduling mechanism to meet the application-specific delay bounds at the sink node. Importantly, the algorithms of the DST protocol mainly run on resource rich sink node, with minimal functionality required at resource constrained sensor nodes. Performance evaluation via simulation experiments show that the DST protocol achieves high performance in terms of real-time communication requirements, reliable event detection, and energy consumption in WSN	algorithm;delay-gradient congestion control;experiment;network congestion;performance evaluation;real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;testbed	Vehbi Cagri Gungor;Özgür B.

41a143b13c1afc9f5d11901fcb1c990d77cc2652	a sink-oriented layered clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks	energy efficiency;network lifetime;routing;wireless sensor network;clustering	Clustering is an effective technique to prolong network lifetime for energy-constrained wireless sensor networks. Due to the many-to-one traffic pattern in a multi-hop network, the nodes closer to the sink also help to relay data for those farther away from the sink, and hence they consume much more energy and tend to die faster. This paper proposes a sink-oriented layered clustering (SOLC) protocol to better balance energy consumption among nodes with different distances to the sink. In SOLC, the sensor field is divided into concentric rings, and the SOLC protocol consists of intra-ring clustering and inter-ring routing. We compute the optimal ring width and the numbers of cluster heads in different rings to balance energy consumption between intra-cluster data processing and inter-cluster data relaying. Cluster heads in a ring closer to the sink has smaller sizes than those in the rings farther away from the sink, and hence they can spend less energy for intra-cluster data processing and more energy for inter-cluster data relay. Simulation results show that the SOLC protocol can outperform several existing clustering protocols in terms of improved network lifetime.

47b482901d8455493a7a401f11a090989433d479	a low redundancy and high coverage node scheduling algorithm for wireless sensor networks		In order to efficiently use node’s energy and prolong node’s life time in wireless sensor networks (WSN), this paper presents a low redundancy and high coverage (LRHC) node scheduling algorithm. In LRHC, based on the characteristics of the cellular, the WSN network is divided into a number of cellular to help the selection of active nodes. A new triangle cover method has been theoretically analyzed and proposed to solve the coverage holes problem for the first time. In addition, during the scheduling, a new active node will be the substitute for the active node near to death, which guarantees the stability of network coverage quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LRHC algorithm reduces the required nodes to satisfy a certain coverage quality, and improves the life time and ensures the high coverage quality of the network compared with some existing algorithms.	algorithm;scheduling (computing)	Ying Xu;ZengRi Zeng	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-46981-1_4	real-time computing;sensor node;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	9.886712681202768	79.84344649907588	181206

6dacb8971b619fd863e9a6346e116deaf75c7927	router nodes placement using artificial immune systems for wireless sensor industrial networks		The present work is concerned with the placement of router nodes in industrial environments for wireless sensor networks applications making use of artificial immune systems ideas. The motivation for using artificial immune systems lies on the properties of uniqueness, distributed sensing, learning and memory efficiency of such systems enabling the transmission of data from sensors to the gateway efficiently. As a matter of fact, that efficiency deals with a low rate of failure and other aspects such as minimizing retransmission issues done by the routers. The chosen criteria to be met are embedded in the so called affinity function which acts as an objective function. The router nodes positioning are accomplished in two modules which uses the immune systems concepts and related ideas. Different scenarios are considered for the presented examples based on oil and gas configurations and for criteria defined in the affinity function.

With the model of dynamic network, distributed computation problems can be formally studied with rigorous correctness. Information dissemination is one of such problems and it has received much attention recently. However, existing works focus on the time cost of dissemination, i.e. how fast the information can be disseminated to all nodes, and communication cost has been largely ignored. Our work focuses on high communication efficiency in information dissemination with correctness property guaranteed. We achieve this by making use of cluster-based hierarchy. Clustering has been widely studied and used in wireless networks to reduce communication cost. However, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been considered in the study of dynamic networks. In this paper, we firstly propose a dynamic network model, named (T, L)-HiNet, to extend existing dynamic network model with clusters. (T, L)-HiNet includes several properties defining the dynamics of cluster hierarchy in a dynamic network. Base on (T, L)-HiNet, we design hierarchical information dissemination algorithms for different scenarios of dynamics. The correctness of our algorithms is proved and the performance is analyzed. Compared with the algorithm recently proposed by Kuhn, Lynch and Oshman [7], our design can significantly reduce communication and our objective is fully achieved.	algorithm;algorithm design;computation;computer cluster;correctness (computer science);distributed computing;multi-core processor;network model;profiling (computer programming)	Zhiwei Yang;Weigang Wu;Yishun Chen;Jun Zhang	2013	2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing	10.1109/ICPP.2013.74	distributed algorithm;system model;network formation;computer science;dynamic network analysis;theoretical computer science;hierarchical network model;network simulation;distributed computing;computer network;cluster	DB	7.178778783981655	78.2091414097981	182512
5ad6d640a956c8ee44630d549ca5ad5eac92c0f9	emggr: an energy-efficient multipath grid-based geographic routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks		Routing in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN) is an important and a challenging activity due to the nature of acoustic channels and to the harsh environment. This paper extends our previous work [Al-Salti et al. in Proceedings of cyber-enabled distributed computing and knowledge discovery (CyberC), Shanghai, pp 331–336, 2014] that proposed a novel multipath grid-based geographical routing (MGGR) protocol for UWSNs. The extended work, EMGGR, viewed the network as logical 3D grids. Routing is performed in a grid-by-grid manner via gateways that use disjoint paths to relay data packets to the sink node. The algorithm consists of three main components: (1) a gateway election algorithm; responsible for electing gateways based on their locations and remaining energy level (2) a mechanism for updating neighboring gateways’ information; allowing sensor nodes to memorize gateways in local and neighboring cells, and (3) a packet forwarding mechanism; in charge of constructing disjoint paths from source cells to destination cells, forwarding packets to the destination and dealing with holes (i.e. cells with no gateways) in the network. The performance of EMGGR has been assessed using Aqua-Sim, which is an NS2 based simulator for UWSNs. Results show that EMGGR is an energy efficient protocol in all simulation setups used in the study. Moreover, EMGGR can also maintain good delivery ratio and end-to-end delay.	geographic routing;multipath propagation	Faiza Al-Salti;Nasser Alzeidi;Bassel R.

Due to limited bandwidth and extreme hi gh cost of satellite communication, the majority of data is unable to transmit via satellites. For the moment, there are no efficie nt data collection methods provided for data collection in underwater sensor networks. After collecting and analyzing GPS data of 40 ships for two months, we find the mobility pattern of ships. On the basis of the mobility pattern, we propose a new data collection strategy for underwater sensor networks through delay tolerant routing. Through simulations and real data analysis, we provide quantitative analysis of the proposed strategy, su ch as data collection ratio, complexity of the algorithm and energy consumption. Especially, the data collection ratio on realdata analysis could reach 95%-100% in acceptable time, which is 30% more than the radio of the strategy that data stored as the y come.	algorithm;communications satellite;delay-tolerant networking;global positioning system;routing;simulation	Chao Liu;Zhongwen Guo;Feng Hong;Kaishun Wu	2014	IJDSN	10.1155/2014/518439	telecommunications;data mining	Mobile	9.521593945250103	75.07005591212757	182711

We present an overview of the recent progress of broadcasting and multicasting in wireless ad hoc networks. We discuss two energy models that could be used for broadcast: one is non-adjustable power and one is adjustable power. If the power consumed at each node is not adjustable, minimizing the total power used by a reliable broadcast tree is equivalent to the minimum connected dominating set problem (MCDS), i.e., minimize the number of nodes that relay the message, since all relaying nodes of a reliable broadcast form a connected dominating set (CDS). If the power consumed at each node is adjustable, we assume that the power consumed by a relay node u is ‖uv‖ , where real number β ∈ [2, 5] depends on transmission environment and v is the farthest neighbor of u in the broadcast tree. For both models, we reviewed several centralized methods that compute broadcast trees consuming the energy within a constant factor of the optimum if the original communication graph is unit disk graph. Since centralized methods are expensive to implement, We further reviewed several localized methods that can approximate the minimum energy broadcast tree for non-adjustable power case. For adjustable power case, no localized methods can approximate the minimum energy broadcast tree and thus review several currently best possible heuristics.

Geographic routing is one of such paradigms whose principles of operation are based on the geographic location of the network nodes. Even though the large number of works already reported in the literature, there are still many open issues towards the design of robust and scalable geographic routing algorithms. In this study, after an analysis of the most relevant solutions reported in the literature, we introduce Azimuth-Range ROuting for largescale Wireless (ARROW) sensor networks. ARROW goes a step further on the design of geographic routing protocols by defining a simple and robust routing protocol whose operation principles completely free the network nodes of the burden of keeping routing records. Under ARROW, nodes carry out all routing decisions exclusively using the information imbedded in the data packets while avoiding the risk of routing loops, a major challenge when designing routing protocols for large-scale networks. Moreover, ARROW is supplemented with a simple yet effective forwarder resolution protocol, also introduced in this study, allowing the fast and loop-free selection of the forwarding node in a hop-to-hop basis. Both protocols, ARROW and the proposed forwarder resolution protocol, are validated by extensive computer simulations. Our results show that both protocols exhibit excellent scalability properties by limiting the overhead.	algorithm;computer simulation;geographic coordinate system;geographic routing;network packet;overhead (computing);scalability;sensor web	Pawel Kulakowski;Esteban Egea-López;Joan García-Haro;Luis Orozco-Barbosa	2013	EURASIP J.

The key feature of a mobile ad hoc network is the mobility of the nodes. Because of the mobility, communication links form and disappear as nodes come into and go out of each other's communication range. Mobile ad hoc networks are particularly useful in situations like disaster recovery and search, military operations, etc. Research on mobile ad hoc networks has drawn a huge amount of attention recently. The main challenges for mobile ad hoc networks are the sparse resources and frequent mobility. Most of the research work has been focused on the MAC and routing layer. In this work, we focus on distributed services for mobile ad hoc networks. These services will provide some fundamental functions in developing various applications for mobile ad hoc networks. In particular, we focus on the clock synchronization, connected dominating set, and k-mutual exclusion problems in mobile ad hoc networks.	hoc (programming language)	Guangtong Cao	2005			clock synchronization;mobile ad hoc network;computer network;connected dominating set;computer science	Mobile	4.595840102574589	80.30052621974815	184023

Timely partition prediction signals action for improving fault tolerance and performing some data or service replication so that the network can continue functioning after partition does occur. This article surveys existing prediction concepts and discusses their scalability, simplicity, correctness, speed, communication overhead, and applications. Existing centralized algorithms declare an edge or a node as critical if its removal will separate the network into several components. Several localized definitions of critical (or cut) nodes and links, and removable nodes, are demonstrated to be simple, useful, and scalable. A node is critical if the subgraph of p-hop neighbors of node (without the node itself) is disconnected. A link is critical if its endpoints have no common p-hop neighbors (assuming that the link between them does not exist). Definitions are extended toward local k-connectivity. The false positives mostly occur when alternative routes exist but are relatively long, and therefore may not provide satisfactory service in applications. Therefore, localized protocols provide faster and often more reliable partition warnings for possible timely replication decisions. This conceptual advance provides ingredients for establishing and restoring biconnectivity.	algorithm;biconnected component;biconnected graph;centralized computing;correctness (computer science);experiment;fault tolerance;graph theory;hoc (programming language);hop-by-hop transport;overhead (computing);removable media;scalability;scheduling (computing);self-organized criticality;sensor;server (computing);software deployment	Ivan Stojmenovic;David Simplot-Ryl;Amiya Nayak	2011	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2011.5687952	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.833782752701138	78.21864261321946	184450
55ace8fde764059acdbc6f075480fedcdf5884e6	hybrid energy-efficient multi-path routing for wireless sensor networks		The effectiveness of a wireless sensor network relies on the underlying routing protocol. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm which leverages both flat and hierarchical routing schemes for maximizing energy efficiency. It designates some desired number of nodes as cluster heads leading to cluster formation in the network. Inside clusters, nodes adopt multi-hop routing scheme to communicate with cluster head, which on reception of data packets from all cluster members, transmits the aggregated data along the precomputed path to the sink. Intra-cluster communication can happen in two modes viz., philanthropist —maximal residual energy neighbor node is selected, and selfish —nearest node is selected as next hop. Our approach refrain nodes from transmitting along long links, thus minimizing the energy consumption of the network. We simulated our algorithm against established protocols, and results indicate that it outperforms other protocols for network characteristics like energy minimization and scalability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a new cluster-based optimization algorithm is set up which optimizes clustering process, to effectively avoid the low-energy and long-distance nodes as the cluster head. Considering sink node, The object cluster head routing protocol is proposed, it ensure that only the object cluster head send overall data to sink node, which can balance energy depletion among the cluster heads in WSN.

HNC is deterministic and distinguishes between nodes that must, may, or must not become cluster heads and/or gateways - hence heterogeneous networks, such that constraints regarding functionality and energy of nodes can be considered. In clustering terminology, HNC determines a 3-hop-connected 1-hop dominating set that respects these constraints and optimizes connectivity between cluster heads through additional gateway nodes. We have evaluated various topologies, and have compared it with existing clustering approaches such as LCA and MaxMinD. Furthermore, we have implemented HNC on small sensor nodes, and have deployed it in a production setting.	algorithm;centralized computing;cluster analysis;dominating set;network topology;overhead (computing);overlay network;stationary process	Christopher Kramer;Dennis Christmann;Reinhard Gotzhein	2016	2016 Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2016.7461485	heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;hierarchical network model;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	6.476353356352107	78.43294976724923	184830

In traditional clustering, each node belongs to only one cluster. However, some applications need some nodes to affiliate to more than one cluster. We propose a clustering algorithm that has capability to control the overlapping between clusters with still having ability to maintain the balance of energy consumption. Our proposed algorithm is a modification version of LEACH, so we call ours as Overlapping LEACH (O-LEACH). In the algorithm, we insert a mechanism so that it is able to control the overlap among clusters. In O-LEACH, as in original LEACH, a non-cluster-head (non-CH) will choose to join to a cluster-head (CH) that has largest received signal strength. Next, OLEACH will ask the node to affiliate to other CH that has received signal strength larger than X% from main CH. The X limit value is determined based on the expected overlapping degree. By simulation evaluation, O-LEACH has succeeded to control the overlapping among clusters. The proposed algorithm also still able to maintain the load balancing among node that be proven with the very little degradation compared to original LEACH on the performance of maintaining the balance of energy consumption.	algorithm;cluster analysis;elegant degradation;load balancing (computing);low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;scalability;simulation	Amin Suharjono;Wirawan;Gamantyo Hendrantoro	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021603	algorithm design;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;load balancing;machine learning;distributed computing;efficient energy use;cluster analysis;computer network	Robotics	8.748127823556306	80.23568761274744	185225

Aggregating and combining such different types of sensor data, such as the amount of rainfall and water levels of rivers, can help to develop more valuable applications. However, these processes may cause load concentrations on a particular processing node, which consequently may cause a scalability issue. To handle this issue, we consider a division strategy that is appropriate for large sensor networks as well as providing a data processing mechanism. This system enhances the application fields in ubiquitous sensing environments. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable sensor data processing mechanism on the basis of a content-based network. Our mechanism has a load distribution mechanism that dynamically divides and moves subscriptions so that our system can efficiently avoid an excessive load on a particular processing node. The performance evaluation of our proposed system shows that the load distribution mechanism works well and has high scalability.	load balancing (computing);performance evaluation;response time (technology);scalability;sensor	Ryota Miyagi;Satoshi Matsuura;Satoru Noguchi;Atsuo Inomata;Kazutoshi Fujikawa	2012	2012 IEEE/IPSJ 12th International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2012.77	routing;message passing;real-time computing;scalability;data processing;computer science;operating system;middleware;database;distributed computing;processor register;world wide web;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Embedded	9.032760182045964	75.83092442961927	185341

In this novel algorithm, fusion node is firstly selected which is mainly used for data receiving and processing in the cluster. Then, based on the difference of distance from fusion node to base station, vice fusion nodes of non-uniform are chose, which is mainly responsible for data forwarding from fusion nodes. DNDC can balance the network energy consumption. Furthermore, routing data path for the new type of algorithm is improved by using ant colony optimization algorithm. The enhanced algorithm ADNDC can prolonged the survival time of the network .Simulation shows that the two proposed algorithms DNDC and ADNDC have integrated the advantages of planar fusion algorithm and hierarchical fusion algorithm. ADNDC can not only balance the network energy consumption but also extend the network lifespan. Besides, the ADNDC algorithm can be applied to large scale networks or the network which has large proportion of (vice) fusion nodes.

In this paper, we present a novel gossip-based scheme using which all the nodes in an n-node overlay network can compute the common aggregates of MIN, MAX, SUM, AVERAGE, and RANK of their values using O(n log log n) messages within O(log n log log n) rounds of communication. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first result that shows how to compute these aggregates with high probability using only O(n log log n) messages. In contrast, the best known gossip-based algorithm for computing these aggregates requires O(nlog n) messages and O(log n) rounds. Thus, our algorithm allows system designers to trade off a small increase in round complexity with a significant reduction in message complexity. This can lead to dramatically lower network congestion and longer node lifetimes in wireless and sensor networks, where channel bandwidth and battery life are severely constrained.	aggregate data;computation;max;network congestion;overlay network;randomized algorithm;with high probability	Srinivas R.

One of the best known algorithm, named BIP (broadcast incremental power), constructs a spanning tree rooted at a given node. This protocol offers very good results in terms of energy savings, but its computation is unfortunately centralized, as the source node needs to know the entire topology of the network to compute the tree. Many localized protocols have since been proposed, but none of them has ever reached the performances of BIP. Even distributed versions of the latter have been proposed, but they require a huge transmission overhead for information exchange and thus waste energy savings obtained thanks to the efficiency of the tree, in this paper, we propose and analyze a localized version of this protocol. In our method, each node is aware of the position of all the hosts in the set of its 2-hop neighborhood and compute the BIP tree on this set, based on information provided by the node from which it got the packet. That is, a tree is incrementally built thanks to information passed from node to node in the broadcast packet. Only the source node computes an initially empty tree to initiate the process. We also provide experimental results showing that this new protocol has performances very close to other good ones for low densities, and is very energy-efficient for higher densities with performances that equal the ones of BIP.	algorithm;bip-8;broadcasting (networking);centralized computing;computation;file spanning;hoc (programming language);information exchange;linear programming;network packet;overhead (computing);performance;spanning tree	François Ingelrest;David Simplot-Ryl	2005	10th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC'05)	10.1007/s11276-006-9817-7	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	6.3749968747427435	80.1506971994311	186476

In Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN), event detection is one of the main requirements for most of the applications. An event can be a simple event or a combination of two or more simple events (Composite Event). Detecting and reporting an event desired by the application (user) inspite of stringent constraints of sensor nodes like low energy, low bandwidth, frequent failures etc., is one of the main challenges in WSN. This can be achieved with less uncertainty and masking failures by considering collaboration among sensor nodes. We propose a framework for distributed event detection using collaboration in WSN. The framework consists of two protocols that build a tree by using a communication model similar to the Publish-Subscribe paradigm. This framework is a part of Component Oriented Middleware for Sensor networks (COMiS). In COMiS framework, components are loaded as and when required based on the application semantics. If collaboration is considered, the goal of the application can be easily accomplished even in case of failures of sensors and low energy of nodes.	communications protocol;mask (computing);middleware;programming paradigm;publish–subscribe pattern;requirement;sensor;tree (data structure)	A.

One is the void hole which occurs in a particular region due to unavailability of forwarder nodes. The other is the presence of energy hole which occurs due to imbalanced data traffic load on intermediate nodes. Therefore, an optimum transmission strategy is required to maximize the network lifespan via hole alleviation. In this regard, we propose a heterogeneous network solution that is capable to balance energy dissipation among network nodes. In addition, the divide and conquer approach is exploited to evenly distribute number of transmissions over various network areas. An efficient forwarder node selection is performed to alleviate coverage and energy holes. Linear optimization is performed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed work in term of energy minimization. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to show that our claims are well grounded. Results show the superiority of our work as compared to the baseline scheme in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime.	anatomic node;baseline (configuration management);cessation of life;code coverage;deploy;energy minimization;equilibration disorder;equilibrium;expectation–maximization algorithm;feasible region;gene regulatory networks;genetic heterogeneity;internet of things;linear programming;mathematical optimization;maximal set;network packet;node - plant part;simulation;software deployment;the void (virtual reality);unavailability;via (electronics);void - tableframe;cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine protocol	Zahid Wadud;Nadeem Javaid;Muhammad Awais Khan;Nabil Ali Alrajeh;Mohamad Souheil Alabed;Nadra Guizani	2017		10.3390/s17071677	wireless sensor network;heterogeneous network;unavailability;divide and conquer algorithms;engineering;computer network;energy consumption;node (networking);forwarder;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	9.71181757628114	79.68666648442225	186925

In the mobile sink research, there are the track based methods and the anchor points based methods as representative operation methods for mobile sinks. However, most existing methods decrease the Quality of Service (QoS) and lead to routing hotspots in the vicinity of the mobile sinks. The main reason is that they use static mobile sink movement paths that ignore the network environment such as the query position and the data priority. In this paper, we propose a novel mobile sink operation method that solves the problems of the existing methods. In our method, the probe priority of the mobile sink is determined from data priority to increase the QoS. The mobility of sink used to reduce the routing hotspot. Experiments show that the proposed method reduces the query response time and improves the network lifetime much more than the existing methods.

155db6ca0c491bbec2ec00557b48784cde87117d	uncoordinated cooperative multihop forwarding in 2d highly dynamic networks		This paper investigates cooperative forwarding in two-dimensional highly dynamic wireless networks. Unlike traditional coordinated cooperative forwarding schemes that require a large amount of neighborhood discovery and coordination information to be exchanged before making the forwarding decision, this paper proposes an uncoordinated cooperative forwarding scheme where each node determines whether or not to forward a received packet independently based on a forwarding probability determined by its own location, the locations of the destination, and the transmitter from which it receives the packet, without the costly or even impractical neighbor discovery and coordination process. Analytical results are derived for the successful transmission probability and the expected number of forwarding nodes involved in the cooperative forwarding process. On that basis, discussions are presented on the optimal forwarding probability design that meets a predesignated successful transmission probability target using minimum number of forwarding nodes. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.

These multi-sensors are integrated in a way that produces an overwhelming amount of data, termed as big data. The multi-sensor system creates several challenges, which include getting actual information from big data with high accuracy, increasing processing efficiency, reducing power consumption, providing a reliable route toward destination using minimum bandwidth, and so on. Such shortcomings can be overcome by exploiting some novel techniques, such as clustering, data fusion, and coding schemes. Moreover, data fusion and clustering techniques are proven architectures that are used for efficient data processing; resultant data have less uncertainty, providing energy-aware routing protocols. Because of the limited resources of the multi-sensor system, it is a challenging task to reduce the energy consumption to survive a network for a longer period. Keeping challenges above in view, this paper presents a novel technique by using a hybrid algorithm for clustering and cluster member selection in the wireless multi-sensor system. After the selection of cluster heads and member nodes, the proposed data fusion technique is used for partitioning and processing the data. The proposed scheme efficiently reduces the blind broadcast messages but also decreases the signal overhead as the result of cluster formation. Afterward, the routing technique is provided based on the layered architecture. The proposed layered architecture efficiently minimizes the routing paths toward the base station. Comprehensive analysis is performed on the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art centralized clustering and distributed clustering techniques. From the results, it is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms competitive algorithms in terms of energy consumption, packet loss, and cluster formation.	big data;broadcast domain;centralized computing;cluster analysis;computer programming;hybrid algorithm;network packet;overhead (computing);resultant;routing;sensor	Sadia Din;Awais Ahmad;Anand Paul;Muhammad Mazhar Ullah Rathore;Gwanggil Jeon	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2679207	wireless ad hoc network;routing;data stream clustering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;base station;data mining;cluster analysis;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.935956943893478	80.83320798050008	187831

555b54191e30c7791ba64b5a7300ab8ce5ec77ef	a framework architecture for energy-aware routing protocols in wireless sensor networks		A wireless sensor network is an infrastructureless, self organizing communication network, in which resource constrained sensors individually sense the environment but collaboratively achieve complex information gathering and dissemination tasks. The need to conserve energy to prolong the network’s lifetime is the most critical issue in the design of scalable and robust protocols for wireless sensor networks. In oder to achieve these goals we have designed and implemented the network architecture of a sensor node, taking into account the energetic behavior of each of its components. The architecture has a modular structure, promoting composability and reusability of protocol modules at each layer of the protocol stack. For routing protocols we propose new strategies (metrics) taking into account energetic information, that allows us to take appropriate routing decisions in order to extend the lifetime of the wireless sensor network. Besides providing energy-efficient medium access control protocols and routing protocols independently, we also ensure a joint optimization by enabling an additional exchange of relevant information between the two types of protocols by adding a cross-layer component in the protocol stack. We have implemented the proposed architecture in a simulation framework which provides a flexible approach to design and embed (plug-and-play) various protocols at network and MAC layers, and to combine and analyse the impact of different strategies and various parameters on the performance and lifetime of the wireless sensor network. The framework can automatically visualize performance criteria to enable a fast evaluation and comparison of protocols. The designed simulation framework is a valuable and powerful tool, which it considerably simplifies the quantitative effort to design new routing protocols and to integrate them into a complete protocol stack.

This paper proposes a simple and efficient broadcast protocol, called Broadcast based on Layered Diffusion (BLD), which is a stateless broadcast protocol with very low message overheads and very low computation requirements. In BLD, nodes do not need to exchange neighborhood information for building a broadcast backbone, but make their rebroadcast decisions locally. The design idea of BLD is to emulate the triangular tessellation for complete area coverage of the network field. It does not require nodes' location information for such tessellation emulation but only exploits the hop count information for each node to make local rebroadcast decision and timing. Simulation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the BLD protocol and its robustness to localization errors and transmission errors.

The mobile agent computing paradigm has many benefits in the context of sensor networks. However, the most challenging problem in mobile agent based computing, the design of mobile agent itinerary, is left unanswered. An improper design of itinerary (or route) of mobile agent migration can largely deteriorate the performance of collaborative processing. In this paper, we study the key problem of deriving mobile agent itinerary for collaborative processing, especially the dynamic mobile agent planning since it is more suitable for the wireless sensor networks. This paper presents two dynamic itinerary planning algorithms, the dynamic and the predictive dynamic approaches. We design three metrics (energy consumption, network lifetime, and the number of hops ) and use simulation tools to quantitatively measure the performance of different itinerary planning algorithms.

PEAS extends the network lifetime by maintaining a necessary set of working nodes and turning off redundant ones, which wake up after randomized sleeping times and replace failed ones when needed. The fully localized operations of PEAS are based on each individual node’s observation of its local environment but do not require per neighbor state at any node; this allows PEAS to scale to very dense node deployment. PEAS is highly robust against node failures due to its simple operations and randomized design; it also ensures asymptotic connectivity. Our simulations and analysis show that PEAS can maintain an adequate working node density in presence of as high as 38% node failures, and a roughly constant overhead of less than 1% of the total energy consumption under various deployment densities. It extends a sensor network’s functioning time in linear proportional to the deployed sensor population. ∗A Shorter version of this paper appeared in ICDCS 2003. F. Ye ( ) IBM T.J.

The existing approaches of event detection usually employ certain event models that are constructed with prior domain knowledge. The resulting event detection processes appear to be cost-inefficient, which require either intensive data exchanges among neighboring nodes or caching large columns of history data. In this paper, we focus on the issue of locating event in wireless sensor network without locations. This involves two tasks, namely detecting an event and identifying an area in the network where the event occurs. Motivated by the real system, we propose a model-free approach for event detection called CCD (Coding Cost based event Detection). Coding cost is a metric that quantifies the diversity of a set of sensor readings. Incorporated into the inherent data collection mechanism, CCD passively constructs a gradient map of coding cost throughout the network. An event is then detected where a change point of gradient appears and identifies the event pattern automatically. CCD is fully distributed and does not incur apparent communication overhead. We implement CCD and evaluate its performance with extensive experiments and simulations. The results demonstrate that CCD is accurate, scalable, and applicable to a variety of sensor networks.	charge-coupled device;column (database);event-driven programming;experiment;image gradient;overhead (computing);scalability;sensor web;simulation	Shuo Lian;Yuan He;Jizhong Zhao	2011	2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2011.72	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	9.866940320885549	75.66060825715944	189987

The energy efficiency is one of the most important challenges for WSNs in order to extend the network lifetime. There are several widely-used methods to achieve this goal, such as data fusion at coordination sensor nodes, and turning off redundant nodes, etc. The existing methods of redundant nodes elimination are analyzed, and their disadvantages are discussed. Then a new method of redundant node elimination based on the coverage probability is proposed to maximize the network lifetime for the heterogeneous WSNs. Combining with EECRS protocol, an energy efficient protocol based on redundant nodes elimination is proposed. Using random sensors deployment with different sensing radii, it is shown that the sensing coverage quality after using proposed redundant nodes determination method can be guaranteed to 99.9% with more than 8 neighbor nodes for each sensor node, and proposed method has less on-duty nodes compared with other methods. And that can reduce the energy consumption of network. Compared with perimeter coverage protocol and CCP protocol, proposed protocol can extend the network lifetime.

For route detection, it is desirable for mobile computers to transmit less control messages; however, flooding of a route request message in DSR and AODV or repeated location information advertisement in GEDIR, FACE and GPSR is required. This paper proposes no-beacon extensions of GEDIR ad-hoc routing protocol applying on-demand exchange of location information in NB-GEDIR and timer setting based on distance in CNB-GEDIR. Since both protocols do not require repeatedly broadcasted beacon messages, no communication overhead is required in case that there is no route detection request.

The gravitational field (GF) and the radioactive decay (RD) are used to model the repulsion forces between sensor nodes. The Received Signal Strength (RSS) is transformed to the repulsion force for computing the next move distance and direction. The GF approach reduces the power consumption on communication overheads while the RD approach reduces the physical move distance to save energy. A mechanism called as distance-force ratio (DFR) is proposed to improve the oscillation moving problem which sensor nodes move back and forth during the deploying progress. Furthermore, a hybrid approach which combines two models to save energy on mobility and communication is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can reduce the energy spent on mobility and the communication overheads. The hybrid approach inherits the benefits of both models and has well performance on the effective move ratio, the move attempts, coverage, and the deploying time.	dos;divergence-from-randomness model;excalibur: morgana's revenge;grammatical framework;rss;ruby document format;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Shih-Chang Huang	2010	2010 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2010.49	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Robotics	9.016055932950476	78.80050132905158	191250

As most of these actions are performed collaboratively among the actors, inter-actor connectivity is one of the desirable features of WSANs. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed algorithm for establishing a connected inter-actor network topology. Considering initially disjoint sets of actors, our algorithm first initiates a search process by using the underlying sensor network in order to detect the possible sub-networks of actors in the region. After these sub-networks are detected, our algorithm pursues a coordinated actor movement in order to connect the sub-networks and thus achieve inter-actor connectivity for all the actors. This coordinated movement approach exploits the minimum connected dominating set of each sub-network when picking the appropriate actor to move so that the connectivity of each sub-network is not violated. In addition, the approach strives to minimize the total travel distance of actors and the messaging cost on both sensors and actors in order to extend the lifetime of WSAN. We analytically study the performance of our algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments validate the analytical results and confirm the effectiveness of our approach.	sensor	Kemal Akkaya;Fatih Senel	2009	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2009.01.003	distributed algorithm;message;wireless sensor network;computer science;connectivity;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;network topology;computer network	Mobile	8.293572834586644	78.7952816586084	191527

Smart grid communication networks act as not only a bridge between the end power users and the utility but also a backbone of the entire smart grid system. It is a challenging task to deploy smart grid communication networks because of interference-intensive environment. The goal of this paper is to explore various issues on deployment of smart grid communication networks. The first half of this paper provides a survey on smart grid communication networks. The background of smart grid communication networks is introduced, and the IEEE 802.15.4g standard for smart utility networks is reviewed. In addition, the issues on network topology and routing protocols of smart utility networks are addressed, followed by the discussions on optimizing gateway deployment. Various methods for addressing coexistence issues in smart grid communication networks are presented. The second half of this paper is to propose a channel discovery algorithm exploiting the inherent CSMA/CA mechanism in the protocols. Because of the use of CSMA/CA mechanism and up-to-date channel status table, the proposed algorithm can quickly find an available channel for transmission when interferences occur.

594703a2944bdbbecebb9c12d4a5d032c4460aa5	an energy efficient routing protocol for correlated data using cl-leach in wsn	energy efficient approaches;cross layer optimization;wireless sensor network;energy management	Energy efficiency is an important parameter in the research area related to the design of routing protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The consumption of energy during transmission and processing of data is more which makes the sensor network to erroneous state. In WSN, Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is a popular hierarchical routing protocol, which is responsible for energy storage in nodes. The residual energy and distance between the base station and node are not considered for selection of cluster head in traditional methods. This paper proposes a Cross Layer-Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy model (CL-LEACH), an efficient routing protocol to increase the lifetime of the battery. CL-LEACH considers residual energy and for cluster head selection and provides an energy efficient transmission schemes for WSN. The cross-layer design delivers adaptive modulation by abusing intersegment dependencies across Medium Access Control, Physical, and Application layers. Moreover, CL-LEACH utilizes the remaining energy of the node for cluster head selection which preserves the overall energy. The proposed method provides better results in terms of number of live nodes, energy dissipation, message cost when compared to the traditional LEACH protocol.

7e802b780ca90e9d46b6628b714e8834f8e1e78a	cutting down energy usage in wireless sensor networks using duty cycle technique and multi-hop routing		A wireless sensor network is composed of many sensor nodes, that have beengiven out in a specific zoneandeach of them hadanability of collecting information from the environment and sending collected data to the sink. The most significant issues in wireless sensor networks, despite the recent progress is the trouble of the severe limitations of energy resources.Since that in different applications of sensor nets, we could throw a static or mobile sink, then all aspects of such networks should be planned with an awareness of energy.One of the most significant topics related to these networks, is routing. One of the most widely used and efficient methods of routing isa hierarchy (based on clustering) method. In The present study with the objective of cutting down energy consumption and persistence of network coverage, we have offered a novel algorithm based on clustering algorithms and multihop routing.To achieve this goal, first, we layer the network environment based on the size of the network.We will identify the optimal number of cluster heads and every cluster head based on the mechanism of topology control will start to accept members.Likewise, we set the first layer as gate layer and subsequently identifying the gate’s nodes, we’d turn away half of the sensors and then stop using energy and the remaining nodes in this layer will join the gate’s nodes because they hold a critical part in bettering the functioning of the system. Cluster heads off following layers send the information to cluster heads in the above layer until sent data will be sent to gate’s nodes and finally will be sent to sink. We have tested the proposed algorithm in two situations 1) when the sink is off and 2)when a sink is on and simulation data shows that proposed algorithm has better performance in terms of the life span of a network than LEACH and ELEACH protocols.	algorithm;cluster analysis;duty cycle;persistence (computer science);routing;sensor;simulation;topology control	Ali Sedighimanesh;Mohammad Sedighimanesh;Javad Baqeri	2016	CoRR	10.5121/ijwmn.2016.8402	real-time computing;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	8.33180059427381	80.97345577544891	192910

Depending on the relevance between symptoms and diseases, it may not be necessary for every sensor to transmit its measurements for diagnoses. This paper shows how the relevance can be exploited on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer by utilizing the mutual information. A theoretical framework is developed for sensor scheduling under an operation cost constraint. It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found to provide necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based on the theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection and information gain is then designed. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves high performance in terms of energy, latency and collision rate.	access control;algorithm;feature selection;kullback–leibler divergence;mutual information;relevance;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment;top-down and bottom-up design	Hui Wang;Hyeok-soo Choi;Nazim Agoulmine;M.

It may contain one or more base stations to collect sensed data and possibly relay it to a central processing and storage system. These networks are characterized by scarcity of resources, in particular the available energy. We present a distributed algorithm to solve the unique ID assignment problem. The proposed solution starts by assigning long unique IDs and organizing nodes in a tree structure. This tree structure is used to compute the size of the network. Then, unique IDs are assigned using the minimum number of bytes. Globally unique IDs are useful in providing many network functions, e.g. configuration, monitoring of individual nodes, and various security mechanisms. Theoretical and simulation analyses of the proposed solution have been performed. The results demonstrate that a high percentage of nodes (more than 99%) are assigned globally unique IDs at the termination of the algorithm when the algorithm parameters are set properly. Furthermore, the algorithm terminates in a relatively short time that scales well with the network size. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

90c9237122c96997358c8c6449cb5024b91bea74	a pre-determined nodes deployment strategy of two-tiered wireless sensor networks based on minimizing cost		Nodes deployment is a fundamental factor in determining the connectivity, coverage, lifetime and cost of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, a two-tiered wireless sensor networks consisting of sensor clusters and a base station is considered. Within a sensor cluster, there are many sensor nodes and a relay node. We focus on the deployment strategy for sensor nodes and relay nodes to minimize cost under some constraints. Several means are used. The regular hexagonal cell architecture is employed to build networks. Based on the analysis of energy consumption of sensors and cost of network, an integer programming model is presented to minimize the cost. By the model, number of layers of sensor cluster is determined. In order to balance the energy consumption of sensors on the identical layer, a uniform load routing algorithm is used. The numerical analysis and simulation results show that the waste of energy and cost of wireless sensor networks can be effectively reduced by using the strategy.

Most of the routing and clustering protocols proposed for WSN assume that the nodes are stationary. However, in applications like habitat monitoring or search and rescue, that assumption makes those clustering mechanisms invalid, since the static nature of sensors is not real. In this paper, we propose Zone-based Routing Protocol for Mobile Sensor Networks (ZoroMSN) that considers the design aspects such as mobility of sensors, zones and routes maintenance, information update and communication between sensor nodes. Simulation results show the effectiveness and strengths of the ZoroMSN protocol such as a low routing and mobility overhead, while achieving a good performance in WSN using small zone sizes and sensors with low speed. Simulation results also show that ZoroMSN outperforms existing LEACH-ME and LEACH-M protocols in terms of network lifetime and energy consumptions.	routing	Nidal Nasser;Anwar Al-Yatama;Kassem Saleh	2013	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-011-9562-9	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	8.092860034479967	80.53543263769838	194107

We seek to optimize the lifetime of the network. We have developed three distributed power-aware algorithms and analyzed their efficiency in terms of the number of message broadcasts and the overall network lifetime modeled as the time to the first message that can not be sent. These are: (1) a distributed min Power algorithm (modeled on a distributed version of Dijkstra’s algorithm), (2) a distributed max-min algorithm, and (3) the distributed version of our the centralized online max-min zPmin algorithm presented in [12]. The first two algorithms are used to define the third, although they are very interesting and useful on their own for applications where the optimization criterion is the minimum power, respectively the maximum residual power. The distributed max-min zPmin algorithm optimizes the overall lifetime of the network by avoiding nodes of low power, while not using too much total power.	centralized computing;computer;dijkstra's algorithm;distributed algorithm;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mobile computing;mobile device;power management;robot;routing;sensor	Qun Li;Javed A.

1aa8c8bf2745d432cfcc8f6c97173c75603df1fd	guaranteed delivery in k-anycast routing in multi-sink wireless networks		In k-anycasting, a sensor wants to report event information to any k sinks in the network. In this paper, we describe KanGuRou, the first position-based energy efficient k-anycast routing which guarantees the packet delivery to k sinks as long as the connected component that contains s also contains at least k sinks. A node s running KanGuRou first computes a tree including k sinks with weight as low as possible. If this tree has m ≥ 1 edges originated at node s, s duplicates the messagem times and runsm times KanGuRou over a subset of defined sinks. We present two variants of KanGuRou, each of them being more efficient than the other depending of application settings. Simulation results show that KanGuRou allows up to 62% of energy saving compared to plain anycasting.

This is because sink mobility can greatly alleviate the hotspot issue in WSNs and further prolong the network lifetime. However, sink mobility also causes unexpected changes in network topology and data routing paths, which can largely affect the routing performance in such networks. Design of efficient routing protocols for mWSNs has been a critical issue, and much work has been carried out in this aspect. In this article, we first classify existing protocols based on different design criteria and then present a survey of the state-of-the-art routing protocols in this area. We illustrate how each of the protocols works, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we point out some future directions for efficient routing in mWSNs.	java hotspot virtual machine;network topology;routing	Sheng Yu;Baoxian Zhang;Cheng Li;H. T.

88ef8b44ee482a9f95bf6b7a4789ca24a0496f21	event-based clustering architecture for power efficiency in wireless sensor networks		In order to set up WSN in various rigorous environments, the size and power constraints are stricter due to the high demands for convenience and reliability. Therefore, power efficiency is very important for a WSN. For this, a novel architecture is presented in this paper. The proposed architecture categorizes sensors into different clusters by events. In each cluster, a minimum spanning tree is constructed for intracluster routing. The hierarchical architecture is useful in reducing the power consumption. In each intracluster routing tree, only leaf nodes are responsible for periodical detection. Data transmissions only occur when abnormal events are detected. An abnormality will be reported to the data center only if the majority of cluster members sense the same event. By reducing unnecessary data transmissions and shortening transmission distances, the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the power consumption and prolongs the network lifetime without influencing the accuracy of event response. The simulations show that the proposed architecture has about an 18-fold improvement rate in the device lifetime and avoids the false positive caused by the erroneous alarm of a single sensor. The proposed architecture is feasible, practical, and highly applicable to many applications.

Recently, several researches have been studied for this issue, and SPMS, that outperforms the well-known protocol SPIN, specially is a representative protocol. Also one of many characters of SPMS is the using of the shortest path to minimize the energy consumption. However, since it repeatedly uses the same path as the shortest path, the maximizing of the network lifetime is impossible, though it reduces the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel data dissemination protocol, called  E nergy and  D istance  A ware protocol based on  S PIN (EDAS), that guarantees energy-efficient data transmission and maximizes network lifetime. EDAS solves the network lifetime problem by using the residual energy and the efficient distance between nodes to determine a path for data dissemination. The simulation results show that EDAS guarantees energy-efficient transmission and moreover increases the network lifetime by approximately 69% than that of SPMS.

The FACE mode in GFG routing is a recovery mode used when no neighbor closer to destination exists. Face mode requires extracting a planar sub graph out of the unit disk graph. In this paper, we propose to apply partial Delaunay triangulation (PDT) instead of Gabriel graph (GG) used in the original GFG routing. PDT is locally defined without any message exchange in addition to those needed to learn locations of neighbors. This appears to be the densest known such message free planar graph. PDT can be used instead of GG for storing data in wireless sensor networks, where each datum is stored in the face of PDT containing hashed location of datum. Simulation results show the GFG routing has better performance on a PDT than on a GG, since PDT is denser than GG. Applying dominating set based routing or a shortcut scheme can further enhance the PDT-based routing performance.	delaunay triangulation;dominating set;gadu-gadu;geodetic datum;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);keyboard shortcut;php development tools;planar graph;routing;simulation;unit disk graph	Yanli Deng;Ivan Stojmenovic	2009	2009 Mexican International Conference on Computer Science	10.1109/ENC.2009.15	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;static routing;wireless sensor network;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	2.8440499753825503	81.08836729465013	198208

We build a grid infrastructure by equally partitioning the whole sensor field into a grid of cells. The sensor nodes are randomly classified as type A and type B. All sensor nodes of type A and type B in the grid are further organized as group A and group B, respectively. Each cell has a head for each type. We construct dual paths by linking each cell head of each group, respectively. Each group has a leader randomly chosen from cell heads on its own path, responsible for directly transmitting the data to the base station (BS). For data gathering in each round, each cell head aggregates its own data with the data received from the other nodes of the same type in the cell and then transmits to the neighboring cell head toward its own leader. As a result, all gathered data are almost equally transmitted via dual paths so that the energy consumed by each sensor is approximately even. Besides, the group leader is randomly chosen among cell heads of its own path such that the energy load of each cell head is uniform. It greatly benefits the lifetime of the WSN. Simulation results show that the proposed DPBDAS extends the lifetime of sensor nodes so as to prolong the lifetime of the whole network.	data aggregation;depletion region;pegasus;randomness;sensor;simulation;transmitter	Neng-Chung Wang;Yung-Kuei Chiang;Young-Long Chen;Chih-Hung Hsieh	2014	2014 Eighth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2014.69	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.294070713305352	80.50184556494311	198626

Fault tolerance is an important approach to design efficient protocols, with which the networks has strong robustness. In this paper, we propose r-m-domatic partition (r-m-DP) problem to design energy efficient fault tolerance. In a wireless sensor network, the r-m-DP problem is to find some disjoint r-m-dominating sets in the network. Based on the uniform clustering, a constant-factor approximation algorithm for 2-m-DP is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for 2-m-DP. The correctness and performance of the algorithm are confirmed by theoretical analysis.	domatic number	Lili Jia;Jiguo Yu;Dongxiao Yu;Qingbo Zhang	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07782-6_35	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;cluster analysis;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.440612510257264	79.46096431917363	198659

This paper examines the emerging problem of increasing network availability by recharging, replacing or redeploying depleted sensors with the help of mobile entities. When mobility becomes a sensor's attribute and service stations are static, we propose passive vs. pro-active approaches to energy redistribution and restoration. In particular, for pro-active approaches, we study the mobility strategies and underlying topologies that guarantee a successful sensor recharge. The experimental results so far show that taking our novel pro-active approach to energy redistribution and network fatigue outperforms passive strategies. The proposed closest-first swapping-based mobility strategy provides the best overall performance among all the pro-active approaches studied and the proposed Compass Directed Unit Graph provides an efficient and flexible underlying topology to achieve energy equilibrium.	autonomous robot;circuit restoration;entity;paging;rechargeable battery;sensor	Elio Velazquez;Nicola Santoro	2010	2010 Sixth International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2010.31	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.638617146907427	80.0002352400005	198955

Different researching issues have been extensively developed: power consumption, MAC protocols, self-organizing network algorithms, data-aggregation schemes, routing protocols, QoS management, etc. Due to the constraints on data processing and power consumption, the use of artificial intelligence has been historically discarded. However, in some special scenarios the features of neural networks are appropriate to develop complex tasks such as path discovery. In this paper, we explore the performance of two very well known routing paradigms, directed diffusion and Energy-Aware Routing, and our routing algorithm, named SIR, which has the novelty of being based on the introduction of neural networks in every sensor node. Extensive simulations over our wireless sensor network simulator, OLIMPO, have been carried out to study the efficiency of the introduction of neural networks. A comparison of the results obtained with every routing protocol is analyzed. This paper attempts to encourage the use of artificial intelligence techniques in wireless sensor nodes.	algorithm;arachne;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;high-level programming language;interference (communication);link-state routing protocol;mac address;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);performance;programming paradigm;quality of service;self-organization;sensor node;simulation;software propagation	Julio Barbancho;Carlos León;Francisco Javier Molina;Antonio Barbancho	2006		10.1007/11892960_58	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;artificial intelligence;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;artificial neural network	Mobile	4.527777421067631	80.09581410319804	199021
80a5bbed42cc4399f8da46cee9645dae37d13b7a	maximum lifetime communication topologies of secondary user nodes in cognitive radio ad hoc networks		A Cognitive radio ad hoc network (CRAHN) is an ad hoc network of primary user (PU) nodes and secondary user (SU) nodes, wherein the SU nodes use the licensed channels of the PU nodes when not in use. As the availability of the PU channels fluctuates with time, communication topologies spanning the SU nodes have to be dynamically and frequently reconfigured. Given the complete knowledge of the availability of the PU channels, we propose a generic benchmarking algorithm that determines a sequence of stable communication topologies spanning all of the SU nodes such that the number of transitions from one instance of the topology to another is the global minimum. At any time instant t when we need a stable communication topology spanning the entire network, we look for the largest value of k such that the intersection of the static SU graphs from time instants t to t+k, defined as the mobile graph Gt...t+k(SU) = Gt(SU) ∩ Gt+1(SU) ∩ .... ∩ Gt+k(SU), is connected and that the mobile graph Gt...t+k+1(SU) is not connected. We repeat the above procedure for the entire network session to determine a sequence of longest-living instances of the mobile graphs and the corresponding instances of the communication topology of interest (say a shortest path tree rooted at a source SU node) such that the number of topology transitions is the minimum. We prove the theoretical correctness of the algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness by implementing it to determine a sequence of shortest path trees of the maximum lifetime.	breadth-first search;centralized computing;cognitive radio;connected dominating set;correctness (computer science);dijkstra's algorithm;file spanning;free variables and bound variables;greedy algorithm;heuristic;high- and low-level;hoc (programming language);huffman coding;ibm systems network architecture;kruskal's algorithm;maxima and minima;minimum spanning tree;prim's algorithm;shortest path problem;simulation;superuser;time complexity;tree (data structure)	Natarajan Meghanathan	2015	Computer and Information Science	10.5539/cis.v8n3p1	combinatorics;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Web+IR	5.638213304766108	79.45251456697518	199054

In crowdsensing, mobile sensors (humans, vehicle-mounted sensors, etc.) generate streams of information that is used for inferring high-level phenomena of interest (e.g, traffic jams, air pollution). Unlike traditional sensor network data, crowdsensed data has a highly skewed spatio-temporal distribution caused largely due to the mobility of sensors [1]. Thus, designing systems that can mitigate this effect by acquiring crowdsensed at a fixed spatio-temporal rate are needed. In this paper we propose using multi-dimensional point processes (MDPPs), a mathematical modeling tool that can be effectively used for performing this data acquisition task.	crowdsensing;data acquisition;high- and low-level;mathematical model;sensor	Saket Sathe;Timos K.
