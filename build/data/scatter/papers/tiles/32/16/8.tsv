0a93fe79b144ed7cd0194b3d7c0fc4ee28641929	automated alignment of rna sequences to pseudoknotted structures		Seq7 is a new program for generating multiple structure-based alignments of RNA sequences. By using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path through a specially constructed graph, Seq7 is able to align RNA sequences to pseudoknotted structures in polynomial time. In this paper, we describe the operation of Seq7 and demonstrate the program's abilities. We also describe the use of Seq7 in an Expectation-Maximization procedure that automates the process of structural modeling and alignment of RNA sequences.	align (company);alignment;class diagram;dijkstra's algorithm;expectationâ€“maximization algorithm;graph - visual representation;polynomial;rna;short;shortest path problem;time complexity	Jack E.
