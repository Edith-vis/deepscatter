Under these conditions, mobile hosts must nd routes to destinations without the use of designated routers and also must dynamically adapt the routes to the current link conditions. This paper proposes a distributed adaptive routing protocol for nding and maintaining stable routes based on signal strength and location stability in an ad-hoc network and presents an architecture for its implementation.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;network packet;overhead (computing);route distinguisher;routing;simulation	Rohit Dube;Cynthia D.

In the case of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) this effort is even more noticeable due to the complexity of the dynamic environment of these networks. An appropriate resource allocation capable of integrating multimedia services with different requirements implies the design of efficient call admission control (CAC) techniques that in this ad hoc scenario require a distributed operation. This operation can be performed through a QoS routing process based on a cross-layer design. The interlayer cooperation allows to define new QoS metrics that reflect the network resource utilization and a bandwidth reservation carried out according to the different service demands during the path discovery guarantees the quality of the admitted connections	common access card;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);quality of service;requirement;routing;throughput	María Canales;José Ramón Gállego;Ángela Hernández-Solana;Antonio Valdovinos	2006	2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2006.254174	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile qos;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-2.0609631705828995	87.45082281740278	149081

Many applications currently envisioned for mobile ad hoc networks require multicasting. Several multicasting protocols have been proposed for mobile ad hoc networks, one of the most popular being the On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol. This paper provides a review of ad hoc multicast routing protocols, focusing on MAODV, ODMRP and a variation of ODMRP called reliable-ODMRP. NS-2 simulations are used to compare the reliability and overhead of MAODV, ODMRP, and R-ODMRP.	datagram;hoc (programming language);multicast;odmrp;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;shortest path problem;simulation;unicast	Kumaran Sambandan;Gergely V.

The main objective of our work is to optimize the Delay- and delay Variation Bounded Multicast Tree (DVBMT) problem, which has been proved to be NP-complete. This problem has to satisfy the minimum delay variation and the end-to-end delay within an upper bound. The well-known algorithms solved this problem are the DVMA, the DDVCA, the Cheng's algorithm, and so on. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that outperforms other algorithms in terms of the multicast delay variation in the realistic network environment. The enhancement increases to approximately 3.7%~ 32.9% in terms of that. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(mn2), which is comparable to that of DDVCA.	algorithm;apollonian network;end-to-end principle;file spanning;heuristic;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;multicast;np-completeness;quality of service;real-time clock;routing;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Soobeen Ahn;Moonseong Kim;Hyunseung Choo	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.480	wireless ad hoc network;time complexity;the internet;mobile ad hoc network;np-complete;heterogeneous network;quality of service;communication in small groups;computer science;theoretical computer science;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;source-specific multicast;computational complexity theory;network delay;xcast;computer network;satisfiability	EDA	-3.1108142618771053	82.67221223093941	149585

Several QoSaware routing algorithms for group multicast proposed previously take into account bandwidth requirement (which is the most important QoS metric to consider for many applications) and build source-based tree for each individual group member. Per-source tree approach has some advantages over shared-tree approach but suffers the drawbacks of higher control overhead and being less scalable especially with group size. In this paper we present an algorithm which builds shared tree for group multicast and can accommodate multiple QoS requirements including bandwidth and inter-member delay. Besides the advantages of having less control overhead and better scalability, our algorithm can support dynamic membership without recomputing the whole tree. The results from simulation experiments for multicast with bandwidth reservation show that our algorithm has similar performance in terms of tree cost and bandwidth utilization compared with two other per-source tree algorithms.	algorithm;experiment;generative topographic map;list of algorithms;multicast;overhead (computing);quality of service;requirement;routing;scalability;simulation	Aiguo Fei;Zhihong Duan;Mario Gerla	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.966206	real-time computing;multicast;directed graph;ip multicast;inter-domain;quality of service;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;size of groups, organizations, and communities;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-2.699658729534872	83.01694102803222	150390

As networks grow in size, nodes tend to form clusters geographically and hierarchical routing schemes are more commonly used. Loss network and reduced load models are often used to approximate end-to-end call blocking probabilities and hence throughput. However so far all work being done in this area is for flat networks with flat routing schemes. We aim at developing a more efficient approximation method for networks that have a natural hierarchy and/or when some form of hierarchical routing policy is used. We present two hierarchical models in detail for fixed hierarchical routing and dynamic hierarchical routing policies, respectively, via the notion of network abstraction, route segmentation, traffic segregation and aggregation. Computation is done separately within each cluster (local) and among clusters (global), and the fixed point is obtained by iteration between local and global computations. We present results from both numerical experiments and discrete event simulations.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);computation;computer cluster;end-to-end principle;experiment;fixed point (mathematics);hierarchical database model;iteration;network model;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);routing;simulation;throughput	Mingyan Liu;John S.

We consider the most common types of attacks, namely rushing attack, blackhole attack, neighbor attack and jellyfish attack. Specifically, we study how the number of attackers and their positions affect the performance metrics of a multicast session such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, end-to-end delay, and delay jitter. We also examine rushing attackers' success rates of invading into the routing mesh when the number of attackers and their positions vary. The results enable us to suggest measures to minimize the impacts of the above types of attacks on multicast in MANETs.

OLSRv2 uses the common packet format, that is also being standardized in the MANET WG. It is necessary to validate the OLSRv2 protocol specification by implementing OLSRv2. In addition, OLSRv2 has a great capability to reduce message size compared to OLSR. This is due to address compression. The change of control message size directly affects the total network performance, but how much it affects the various parameters are dependent on the network scale, number of nodes, and address compression implementation. In this context, we have implemented the OLSRv2 protocol, which can run as a real-time protocol or in the QualNet simulator. In addition, we added link disconnection feedback function from MAC layer to OLSRv2 modifying wireless LAN device driver. In this paper our OLSRv2 implementation detail is introduced, and OLSRv2 performance is compared with OLSR by using both a 50 node testbed built in Niigata university and also in the Qualnet simulator. In addition, IP address compression effect is analyzed in the simulator, and the performance of OLSRv2 with link layer disconnection feedback is evaluated in the testbed.	device driver;hoc (programming language);network packet;network performance;optimized link state routing protocol;performance evaluation;real-time transcription;testbed	Yasunori Owada;Taka Maeno;Hiroei Imai;Kenichi Mase	2007		10.1145/1280940.1280955	real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	0.49867600501650977	86.77553452651016	153335

In this paper, we thoroughly analyzed the adaptive monitor based routing (AMBR) protocol by varying different parameters that affect a routing protocol to measure its performance. Analysis shows that it requires less routing control overhead comparing with other prevalent routing protocols. An improved analytical model is also presented in this paper. All these analyses firmly prove that AMBR is a sound and robust protocol in terms of flooding, routing overhead and hence, enhances reliability.	ansi escape code;communications protocol;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);routing	Tanay Dey;M.

The algorithm is called Two-level Class-based Routing with Prediction (TCRP). Since frequently flooding routing information is very expensive for dynamic routing, the TCRP is designed to have the traffic load information monitored in one stable period as a guide to control traffic forwarding in the next stable period. The monitoring function is implemented by adopting the leaky bucket mechanism. In TCRP, the path selection function can utilize resources on multipath to achieve load balancing, increase network throughput and reduce the queuing delay. The extensive simulation is conducted to analyze the performance of the TCRP algorithm. The simulation results show that the TCRP can reduce packet drops and increase network throughput in any size network topology.	dijkstra's algorithm;experiment;ibm notes;inter-domain;internet;leaky bucket;load balancing (computing);multipath routing;network packet;network topology;openmp;propagation delay;quality of service;queuing delay;simulation;software propagation;testbed;throughput	Bing Chen;Shahram Latifi	2000	Cluster Computing	10.1023/A:1019080104072	leaky bucket;routing table;routing;static routing;real-time computing;quality of service;adaptive routing;computer science;load balancing;multipath routing;distributed computing;network topology;computer network	Metrics	-0.20735009714703903	84.73602948753475	153830

The main drawback of DCUR is its assumption of link costs. It means that the minimum cost path is more often chosen and therefore the load distribution is not fair for the minimum cost paths. In this paper we propose a way to modify the cost and delay metrics dynamically in the course of load distribution in the links. We propose weight functions that modify the cost and delay based on the current load of the links.

The goal of this work is to investigate the impact of these characteristics on the performance of TCP. First, we investigate throughput performance of TCP as a function of path length (i.e. multiple wireless hops), node mobility, and traffic intensity. Next, we examine the 'fairness' of the ad hoc network with regard to equal sharing of network bandwidth among multiple TCP flows. Third, we evaluate the impact of two on-demand routing protocols (i.e. AODV and DSR) on the throughput of TCP. Finally, a factorial design experiment is conducted to quantify the effects and interactions of three factors, which influence the throughput of TCP. These factors include routing, node speed, and node pause time. Two key results were observed. Results show that traffic intensity (e.g. number of concurrent flows) is significantly affects TCP throughput, suggesting the need for congestion control, scheduling and traffic management schemes. Second, source routing achieves higher throughputs while also generating significantly less routing overhead than AODV. Results also show that in some instances, the fairness of the network is very uneven among concurrent TCP flows, resulting in several sending stations achieving very little or no throughput.	hoc (programming language)	Dmitri D.

As packet switching can not be deployed for deflection routing based NoCs, the appropriate link width for such NoCs is crucial. Further, the most appropriate link width can be considerably larger, compared to packet switched NoCs. In this paper, we present a new alternating transmission scheme for deflection routing which allows smaller link widths. Simulations and theoretical comparisons with existing basic transmission methods show that our approach outperforms the existing approaches for high injection rates and uniform packet sizes.	routing	Armin Runge;Reiner Kolla	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-30695-7_4	telecommunications;distributed computing	Crypto	-3.7822266226348957	85.64240155537348	155695

First, we select a set of nodes, where each is a root node, called core, of a constructed local share tree for connecting parts of neighborhood destinations. Based on these local shared trees, the HMP will be executed on two stages: the first stage, reactive stage, and the second stage, proactive stage. During the first stage, source host forwards source messages to the set of core nodes of those local shared trees using on-demand routing. The second stage is that each core node forwards the source messages to destination nodes along its corresponding constructed local shared tree. Finally, we show that our proposed scheme outperforms the reactive and proactive multicast protocols existing in mobile ad-hoc networks.	hoc (programming language);multicast	Tzung-Shi Chen;Yuh-Shyan Chen;Hua-Wen Tsai	2001		10.1109/ICON.2001.962348	wireless routing protocol;communications protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;multicast;mobile ad hoc network;ip multicast;inter-domain;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;mobile computing;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	1.5463125405070102	82.43738036904544	156535

An InfWMN is a hierarchical network consisting of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways. The mesh routers form a wireless mesh infrastructure to which the mesh clients are connected through the use of star topology. The previous analytical solutions have only investigated the asymptotic per-client throughput capacity of either single-channel InfWMNs or multi-channel InfWMNs under conditions in which each infrastructure node (i.e. wireless routers and gateways), has a dedicated interface per-channel. The results of previous analytical studies show that there are quite few studies that have addressed the more practical cases where the number of interfaces per-node is less than the number of channels. In this paper, we derive an original analysis of the asymptotic per-client throughput capacity of multi-channel InfWMNs in which the number of interfaces per-infrastructure node, denoted by m, is less than or equal to the number of channels, denoted by c. Our analysis reveals that the asymptotic per-client throughput capacity of multi-channel InfWMNs has different bounds, which depend on the ratio between c and m. In addition, in the case that m < c, there is a reduction in the capacity of the InfWMN compared to the case in which c = m.

The mobile domain introduces variable conditions mainly due to the wireless communications and the changing topology of the underlying network. Testing software is therefore difficult because of the sheer number of variables that must be considered in order to realistically replicate the intended deployment environment. In this paper we provide a comparison of two static, lab-based Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) emulation techniques: MAC address filtration and channel separation. These techniques were deployed and tested on a testbed that had global communication links to the Internet. These techniques have been designed to help developers emulate the effects that mobility will have on their protocols and applications in a realistic environment, while reducing resource cost and logistical complexities that are inherent problems when testing across the intended network deployment. Specifically, we focus on the radio interference apparent in the two emulation techniques and show its affect on network performance.	deployment environment;emulator;interference (communication);logistics;mac address;network performance;self-replicating machine;software deployment;testbed	William Palmer;Ben McCarthy;Christopher Edwards	2009	2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium	10.1109/WTS.2009.5068955	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-0.8970725778657959	88.25356679274293	157056

This consistency can, however, break temporarily when some overlay nodes fail, since it takes time to repair the broken pointers in a distributed manner. Conventional solutions utilize """"backpointers"""" to quickly know the failure among the pointing nodes, which allows them to fix the pointers in a short time. Overlay nodes are, however, required to maintain backpointers for every pointing node which incurs significant consistency check and memory overheads. This paper proposes a novel light-weight protocol; an overlay node gives a """"testament"""" containing its acquaintances (backpointers) only to its successor (i.e., clockwise closest node), and other nodes are freed from maintaining it. Our carefully-designed protocol guarantees that all acquaintances are registered with the testament even in the presence of churn, and the successor notifies the acquaintances for the deceased. Even if the successor passes away and the testament is lost, the successor of the successor can identify the acquaintances at a high success ratio. Simulations show that our protocol greatly reduces the mean time to repair (MTTR) and memory overheads while messaging cost increases."""	computer simulation;mean time to repair;overlay network;routing;testament	Kimihiro Mizutani;Takeru Inoue;Toru Mano;Osamu Akashi;Satoshi Matsuura;Kazutoshi Fujikawa	2015	2015 21st Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2015.7412563	overlay network;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	OS	1.4991381386204206	83.19936246412226	157061

In this paper, a distance-based location-aided routing (DBLAR) for MANETs had been proposed. By tracing the LI of destination nodes and the change of distance between nodes to adjust route discovery dynamically, the proposed routing algorithm can avoid flooding in the whole networks. Besides, distance update threshold (DVT) is set up to reach the balance between real-time ability and update overhead of location information (LI) of nodes. Meanwhile, the detection of relative distance vector (RDV) can achieve the goal of adjusting forwarding condition. Simulation results reveal that DBLAR performs better than LAR in terms of packet successful delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and routing-load, and the set of DUT and RDV has much effect on this algorithm.	algorithm;default route;device under test;distance-vector routing protocol;end-to-end principle;location-based service;network packet;overhead (computing);real-time clock;simulation	Kun Wang;Meng Da Wu;Weifeng Lu;Pengrui Xia;Subin Shen	2008	Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)	10.1109/ITNG.2008.49	wireless ad hoc network;routing;mobile ad hoc network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;neodymium;information technology;broadcasting;computer network	Robotics	2.262024551153389	83.51700559941709	157076

Firstly, we form the inter-vehicle network into the layered network to construct the shortest path. Next, we deduce the link with maximal lifetime between two directly linked vehicles according to their velocities and moving directions. Furthermore, the lifetime of one hop neighbors is propagated to non-directly linked vehicles to build the long-life routing path. Simulation results show that the proposed method can choose better reliability path than the AODV and the method that only considers the directly linked neighbor with maximal lifetime.	dijkstra's algorithm;maximal set;routing;shortest path problem;simulation	Shih-Chang Huang;Duen-Cheng Shie	2010	2010 13th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems	10.1109/NBiS.2010.19	private network-to-network interface;fast path;constrained shortest path first;longest path problem;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;average path length;computer science;yen's algorithm;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;shortest path problem;path vector protocol;k shortest path routing;shortest path faster algorithm;computer network	Robotics	2.5866367495020275	82.60499130841134	157306

Multicast is an important group communication paradigm that is required by many potential DTN applications, such as data dissemination during military and rescue operations. While multicasting has been studied extensively in the context of the Internet and Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs), efficient multicasting in DTNs is a significantly different and challenging problem due to frequent partitions and intermittent connectivity among nodes. In this paper, we propose a two-level single-copy multicast routing strategy that optimizes both the computing resource usage and the delivery rate. Furthermore, our scheme minimizes the transmission cost by bundling multiple multicast receivers into a single copy of the data packet, and forwarding it to an encounter node that has high delivery probabilities to those multicast receivers. This dynamic tree branching technique allows routing paths to be efficiently shared among multicast destinations. Lastly, we propose new methods to compute one-hop and multihop delivery probabilities that are used in forwarder selection. Through extensive simulation studies using a real-world mobility trace, we show that our scheme achieves a high delivery ratio, low delay, and low (or comparable) transmission cost compared to other multicast strategies.	delay-tolerant networking;higher computing;hoc (programming language);internet;link/cut tree;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;relay;routing;simulation;sparse matrix	Tuan Le;Haik Kalantarian;Mario Gerla	2015	2015 14th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (MED-HOC-NET)	10.1109/MedHocNet.2015.7173160	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	1.0332802407943182	83.06034583586006	157376

The issue of survivability, i.e. the question of how much traffic the network will be able to accommodate if components fail, is increasingly important. We consider the problem of designing a survivable IP network, which also requires determining the routing of the traffic. This is done by choosing the weights used for the shortest path calculations.	algorithm;branch and bound;internet protocol suite;load balancing (computing);loss function;network topology;optimization problem;routing;shortest path problem;telecommunications network;zelda ii: the adventure of link	Peter Broström;Kaj Holmberg	2006	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-006-0067-y	private network-to-network interface;is-is;optimized link state routing protocol;supernetwork;constrained shortest path first;computer science;theoretical computer science;ip forwarding;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer network;open shortest path first	Networks	-3.384256996704833	81.86766633639084	157568

In this paper, we experimentally show that WM can perform reliable and accurate measurements on wireless traffic, in actual, non-ideal channel conditions.We demonstrate how to increase capture performance by merging traces from multiple monitoring devices. This merging enables WM to capture over 99% of the IP layer traffic and over 97% of the MAC/PHY frames in a controlled experiment. Our results indicate that WM enables reliable analysis of the collected traces, and should encourage the wireless research community to use this technique for a wide variety of research areas, such as traffic analysis, user mobility and handoff analysis, and MAC/PHY anomaly detection.	anomaly detection;experiment;phy (chip);tracing (software);traffic analysis;wireless router	Jihwang Yeo;Moustafa Youssef;Ashok K.

A suite of network management protocols build and maintain a network architecture in the form of small-sized trees, each starting from a node that can directly communicate with a gateway. Each node in a tree keeps track of information for its descendent nodes. A new node registers with a foreign agent along a tree path without resorting to an inefficient flooding. We also devise an efficient routing protocol that exploits tree information where route discovery does not use a flooding, either. We examined the proposed protocol for its applicability and got a promising result, even with high network traffic.	hoc (programming language);network architecture;network traffic control;routing;tree (data structure)	Hoon Oh;Phan Anh Tan	2007	2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317943	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	0.15902331000494527	82.80838518499554	158398

The proposed protocol suite addresses several practical issues that arise when nodes equipped with two radio interfaces want to utilize available channels. The routing layer makes a hybrid channel assignment where one interface is fixed and the other is switchable. Based on that, the routing layer runs a shortest path routing algorithm augmented with channel diversity. The link layer implements a slotted structure to minimize broadcast overhead inherent to multi-channel networks. By using flowand packet-level simulators, we make some important observations. First, a hybrid channel assignment is good for connectivity and amenable to shortest-path routing. Second, seeking a shortest-path can be a better routing strategy in terms of global system throughput than complex channel-diverse routing. Third, channel switching delay is not a throttling factor in terms of global system throughput.

a70f2a960aeb758fcf9f78870c8ad2b082d7fca2	caching in combination networks: novel multicast message generation and delivery by leveraging the network topology		Maddah-Ali and Niesen's original coded caching scheme for shared-link broadcast networks is now known to be optimal to within factor two, and has been applied to other types of networks. For practical reasons, this paper considers that a server communicates to cache-aided users through H intermediate relays. In particular, it focuses on combination networks where each of the K =\binom{H}{r} users is connected to distinct r- subsets of relays. By leveraging the symmetric topology of combination networks, this paper proposes a novel method to general multicast messages and to deliver them to the users. By numerical evaluations, the proposed scheme is shown to reduce the download time compared to the schemes available in the literature. The idea is then extended to decentralized combination networks, more general relay networks, and combination networks with cache-aided relays and users. Also in these cases the proposed scheme outperforms known ones.	cache (computing);download;multicast;network topology;numerical analysis;relay;server (computing)	Kai Wan;Mingyue Ji;Pablo Piantanida;Daniela Tuninetti	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422197	multicast;computer network;real-time computing;protocol independent multicast;linear network coding;source-specific multicast;network topology;computer science;relay;server;download;distributed computing	Mobile	-2.8782625788896103	86.31336106108826	159088

In such a network, the number of hops between a source node and a destination node also becomes longer. However, as the route becomes longer, it is difficult to provide the robust and reliable route for mobile ad hoc networks since the multiple route breaks occur at the same time due to the topology change. Therefore, this paper proposes a Route-Split Routing resilient to simultaneous failure (RSR). RSR sets up multiple Subroute Management Nodes (SMN’s) on the route and each SMN manages the subroute between the SMN and the neighboring SMN. When the multiple route breaks occur at the same time, each subroute is repaired by the SMN. Consequently, RSR can reduce the number of control packets used for the route repair and mitigate the network congestion even in case that the number of nodes in the network becomes very larger. key words: ad hoc networks, routing, simultaneous failure	hoc (programming language);network congestion;routing;smn theorem	Tsuyoshi Mizumoto;Tomoyuki Ohta;Yoshiaki Kakuda	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.7.1625	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.1243543867992556	82.59003270802494	159584

The flying nature of the network makes it suitable to collect or disseminate content in urban areas or challenging terrain, where line-of-sight connection between the Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) allows for more efficient communication. Dynamic routing in the network enables the nodes to intelligently establish multi-hop routes to extend the communication range or to overcome obstacles. The presented MANET relies on the IEEE 802.11n WiFi standard for data communications and uses the OLSR routing protocol. Routing decisions based on dynamic link quality measurements allow the network to cope with the fast variability of the wireless channel and the high mobility of the MAVs. The implementation of such a system calls for the integration of advanced communication and control technologies in a very restrictive platform, be it in terms of weight, power consumption or availability of suitable off-the-shelf hardware. A detailed description of the system design is presented, and its performance is characterised based on in-flight network measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of OLSR successfully tested in a MANET with such fast dynamics. We verify the trade-off between achievable throughput and the number of hops, and we report on the sensitivity of communication performance and routing behaviour to MAV orientation and flight path. Mitigation of such dependencies and improvements to the routing algorithm are discussed along with future research directions.	algorithm;angularjs;autopilot;etx (form factor);embedded system;end-to-end principle;global positioning system;heart rate variability;hoc (programming language);implicit shape model;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);mesh networking;open-source software;optimized link state routing protocol;relay;robot;robotics;software deployment;sparse matrix;system call;systems design;throughput;wireless mesh network	Alberto Jimenez-Pacheco;Denia Bouhired;Yannick Gasser;Jean-Christophe Zufferey;Dario Floreano;Bixio Rimoldi	2012	2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477823	policy-based routing;wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;embedded system;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.4189304309279605	86.52300354289233	159852

Compared to the standard Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs), the FANET architecture has some specific features (3D mobility, low UAV density, intermittent network connectivity) that bring challenges to the communication protocol design. Such routing protocol must provide safety by finding an accurate and reliable route between UAVs. This safety can be obtained through the use of agile method during software based routing protocol development (for instance the use of Model Driven Development) by mapping each FANET safety requirement into the routing design process. This process must be completed with a sequential safety validation testing with formal verification tools, standardized simulator (by using real simulation environment) and real-world experiments. In this paper, we considered FANET communication safety by presenting design methodologies and evaluations of FANET routing protocols. We use the LARISSA architecture to guarantee the efficiency and accuracy of the whole system.

The experiments were carried out on the wireless network emulation testbed named QOMB, which was extended to support such DTN evaluations. Our quantitative assessment verified the basic behavior of the DTN implementations, but also identified scalability issues for DTN2 in scenarios with as few as 26 nodes. These results emphasize the need for more extensive large-scale experiments with DTN applications and protocols for comprehensive evaluations in view of functionality validation and performance optimization. This can be readily achieved through the use of emulation testbeds such as the one that we have developed.	delay-tolerant networking;emulator;experiment;image-based modeling and rendering;mathematical optimization;network emulation;performance evaluation;performance tuning;scalability;testbed	Razvan Beuran;Shinsuke Miwa;Yoichi Shinoda	2012		10.1145/2348616.2348624	embedded system;simulation;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-0.41727886569240685	88.07923519178709	160891

For meshed multipath, aiming at achieving a good performance trade-off, we introduce a novel hybrid packet forwarding scheme that takes advantage of more uniform load distribution of SRF and a higher end-to-end throughput of SPF.

6bca698c4309a422b42bfc5a8ccfec17160f88ea	performance evaluation of on demand and table driven protocol for wireless ad hoc network		Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a wireless network without infrastructure. It is a kind of wireless ad-hoc network, and is a self configuring network of mobile routers connected by wireless links. The routers are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily, thus the network's wireless topology may change rapidly and unpredictably. Such a network may operate in a standalone fashion, or may be connected to the larger Internet. There are various routing protocols available for MANETs. The most popular ones are DSR, AODV and DSDV. This paper examines two routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks– the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), the tabledriven protocol and the Ad hoc OnDemand Distance Vector routing (AODV), an On –Demand protocol and evaluates both protocols based on packet delivery fraction ,average end to end delay, throughput and routing overhead while varying pause time. The performance evaluation has been done by using simulation tool NS2 which is the main simulator, NAM (Network Animator) and excel graph which is used for preparing the graphs from the trace files. Simulation revealed that although DSDV perfectly scales to small networks with low node speeds, AODV is preferred due to its more efficient use of bandwidth.	ansi escape code;access control;algorithm;anatomic node;anatomy, regional;bandwidth (signal processing);computation;data rate units;distance-vector routing protocol;graph - visual representation;hoc (programming language);internet;large;mental suffering;nam;network packet;neural network simulation;node - plant part;noonan syndrome 2;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;preparation;protocols documentation;randomness;speed (motion);throughput;wireless router	V.

Fair channel access among different nodes in the wireless mesh network, however, is an important consideration that needs technological solutions before mesh networks can be widely deployed. Lack of fairness significantly decreases the throughput of nodes that are more than one hop away from mesh gateways. We propose an analytical model and use simulation studies to establish the existence of starvation in mesh networks even when we can ameliorate problems due to exposed terminals. Motivated by the inability of standard medium access control (MAC) protocols to limit starvation, we propose a modification to the MAC protocol to alleviate flow starvation. Our proposed algorithm improves the channel usage of short-term flows with nodes that are multiple hops from the gateway by a factor of 7 in some cases with a penalty of 20% reduction in total throughput across all nodes. Our proposed algorithm also has a better performance than two other schemes in terms of a higher fairness index.	access control;algorithm;fairness measure;gw-basic;internet access;mesh networking;quality of service;scalability;simulation;throughput;wireless mesh network	Keivan Ronasi;Sathish Gopalakrishnan;Vincent W.

Existing approaches so far address either the network partitioning problem or are capable of handling large amounts of data, but not both at the same time. In this paper, a novel approach is presented which is based on a negotiation scheme enhanced by an adaptive repetition strategy. Different strategies for the selection of repeated data are presented and evaluated. Simulation results show a reduction of data transfer volume compared to hyper-flooding by 30% to 40% even in the presence of frequent network partitions.	hoc (programming language)	Jörg Hähner;Christian Becker;Kurt Rothermel	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214189	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;mobility model;mobile computing;network topology;dissemination;computer network	Mobile	1.8219485415991403	83.01369146003627	162601

None of the existing link metrics fully account for the characteristics of data loss and delay on the links of a MANET. This paper provides the design of a novel delay-based link quality metric that uses realtime statistics from the wireless driver to take into account wireless contention, congestion, channel loss and mobility. The proposed delay metric is additive, does not introduce much additional overhead and is reflective of the varying wireless link quality. We design an efficient Link Delayaware Routing (LDAR) protocol based on the proposed link metric. The proposed protocol has been implemented on a MANET test bed consisting of 5 laptop nodes. The evaluation of our protocol performed through extensive experimentation on the 5-node multi-hop MANET testbed and network simulator NS-2 demonstrate the superior benefits of the new protocol.	backoff;experiment;hoc (programming language);hop;internet protocol suite;laptop;link-state routing protocol;linux;network congestion;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time data;testbed;utility functions on indivisible goods;wireless router	Sudheendra Murthy;Prasad Hegde;Arunabha Sen	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5198902	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;link control protocol;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.6311380846810977	86.31672873490609	163104

In this paper, we study the problem of finding feasible solutions for the delay constrained group multicast routing problem (DCGMRP). The routing problem in this case involves the construction of a set of delay bounded multicast trees with bandwidth requirements, one for each member of the group, for multicasting messages to other members of the group. We first show that the problem is NP-complete. Next, we propose a heuristic algorithm to find feasible solutions for this problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is able to achieve a high probability of finding feasible solutions for DCGMRP, whenever one exists.	multicast;routing	Chor Ping Low;Xueyan Song	2002	IEEE Trans.

W-PRDR is based on the exchange of RTCP reports to feed the sources with the supported rate so that they can adapt their transmission rate according to the loss state and the allowed fair share bandwidth in the network. In order to fit to a wireless environment, we enhanced the original PRDR algorithm with a loss discrimination scheme to distinguish between congestion losses and random errors due to wireless transmission. We show through simulation the capacity of the WPRDR mechanism to improve the transmission rate under different simulated network topologies.	algorithm;hindley–milner type system;network congestion;network topology;performance evaluation;simulation	Ilhem Lengliz;Abir Ben Ali;Farouk Kamoun	2008		10.1145/1416222.1416234	key distribution in wireless sensor networks;slow-start;computer network	Networks	0.8195473484744922	86.84704559415337	163649

One of the mesh-based solutions that is viable to use is the IEEE 802.11s wireless mesh standard. However, when TCP is employed in this standard for periodic smart meter data collection, the performance starts to degrade due to classical congestion mechanism of TCP which is falsely triggered due to the link failures. The main reason for frequent link failures is the occurring of collisions among beacons sent by the Peering Management Protocol (PMP) of IEEE 802.11s standard to maintain link connectivity among the smart meters (SMs). This in turn causes doubling of the retransmission timeout (RTO) of TCP assuming that there is congestion and thus introduces extra overhead and packet delay. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer approach to inform the transport layer about the link failures happening at the MAC layer. To this end, path error information from the routing protocol of IEEE 802.11s is exploited. The idea is to eliminate the unnecessary doubling of the RTO timer when there is a link failure. We evaluated the proposed mechanism through simulation using ns-3 simulator. The results indicate that significant network performance improvement in terms of end-to-end delay and collection time can be achieved by employing our approach. The simulation results also show that further improvement in collection time can be achieved when an upper bound limit is enforced for the RTO timer.	communications protocol;end-to-end principle;heuristic;network congestion;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);peering;period-doubling bifurcation;recovery time objective;retransmission (data networks);routing;simulation;smart meter;suicidegirls;timer;vii;wireless mesh network	Nico Saputro;Kemal Akkaya;Ali Ihsan Yurekli	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436302	ieee 802.11s;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Embedded	2.210258900612022	84.43980434935098	164173

However they share strong characteristics and requirements, such as node cooperation to enable multi-hop forwarding and dynamic routing protocols to deliver packets. As a result of these similarities, protocols designed for all these wireless networks revolve around a common core of functionality, for example coping with link and node dynamics. They differ only in additional network-specific functionality, such as tree routing structures in sensornets, and parameterization, for example buffer sizes. This convergence of functionality and design goals, as well as the sheer number of proposed protocols in each network class, motivates the idea of applying protocols to more than just their one original class. However, network-layer protocols are usually developed for and tested in only one class of wireless network due to the lack of a platform that allows testing of protocols across different classes of networks. As a result, we unnecessarily constrain the range of settings and scenarios in which we test network	classful network;communications protocol;requirement;routing	Muhammad Hamad Alizai;Hanno Wirtz;Bernhard Kirchen;Klaus Wehrle	2013	J.

The goal is to estimate the total number of nodes in the network with short delay time, high accuracy and small storage overhead. DTNs are occasionally connected networks that may suffer from frequent partitions. While counting in conventional (well-connected) networks has been extensively studied, it remains challenging in DTNs, due to the intermittent network connectivity and heterogeneous nodal mobility. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that exploits effective nodal contact probability to guide the counting process. Extensive simulations based on real mobility traces are carried out to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that it is highly efficient and outperforms all existing solutions.	overhead (computing);simulation;tracing (software)	Ting Ning;Zhipeng Yang;Hongyi Wu	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502708	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;mobile computing;statistics;computer network	Robotics	2.0417451439472103	83.48655092937234	165434

Considering the fundamental issues of resource allocation, we propose a new resource allocation model. In the proposed model, we first involve the social distance parameter to evaluate the relationship between the difference users in the same service requirement set. Then we propose an optimization model to solve the bandwidth problem for each user in a link. The optimization model takes account of a utility function with the social distance function. As an objective function, the utility function can describe the link efficiency perfectly. We finally solve this optimization model by the genetic algorithm. Then we will assess the performance of our method. According to the simulation results, our model can obtain allocate a bandwidth for each user with a high utility.	genetic algorithm;graph bandwidth;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;telecommunications network;utility	Fei Xia;Zongze Xia;Xiaobo Huang;Xiao Gao	2014	The 2014 2nd International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI 2014)	10.1109/ICSAI.2014.7009347	mathematical optimization;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;resource management;management science;electric power system;bandwidth;statistics;dynamic bandwidth allocation	AI	-3.9756690845843274	85.09757920432034	166480
636bc0f9ecf6be51374baa6b23142ebee57fd8d6	a system architecture to aggregate video surveillance data in smart cities		In recent years, we have experienced many initiatives in developing smart cities across the world. In these densely populated cities, video surveillance will play an integral role to ensure the safety of the citizens. The major challenge will be to transport high volumes of data generated from dense deployment of video cameras throughout the city to a central aggregation facility for analysis and storage. To address this problem, we propose a system solution using existing public bus transit system to collect data from the cameras and physically transport it to the bus terminus, to be uploaded to the data center. The system uses heterogeneous wireless network interfaces, where the camera nodes form a mesh network to route the data to the nearest bus stop for offloading. We utilize high capacity links using mmWave devices at bus stops to offload the data to the buses when they make routine stops. We also propose a novel routing protocol, R2H, to route the data generated from these cameras to a bus stop while minimizing the time to offload the video data to an incoming bus. The protocol is designed to be aware of the various challenges that are specific to this system like bus schedule and video payload. We have evaluated our system using wireless experiments and simulation using actual bus route maps and times from New York city area. Our analysis shows that R2H achieves 60% less end to end delay compared to OLSR under varying video payload and time of the day.	aggregate data;aggregate function;closed-circuit television;data center;experiment;internet access;map;mesh networking;network congestion;optimized link state routing protocol;population;simulation;smart city;software deployment;time of arrival	Wenjie Zhou;Dola Saha;Sampath Rangarajan	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417602	embedded system;routing;telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	1.6488952275528856	88.24047228342405	167262

The goal of This work is to reduce this overhead. We propose a path based route discovery scheme which can find a route to the destination with lower overhead than flooding-based route discovery. We also showed that the probability of finding a path to the destination by using path based routing request is not negligible. The path obtained through path based routing request may be far from optimal. Thus, we propose a route expanding scheme which can discover a better path based on the path discovered in path based routing discovery phase. By simulation, we showed that integrating these two schemes has better performance than existing reactive routing protocols like DSR.	ansi escape code;algorithm;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;shortest path problem;simula;simulation	Weilin Zeng;Tatsuya Suda	2004	Proceedings. 13th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (IEEE Cat.

In this paper we simulate that analytic problem with respect to real world scenario by using enhanced antenna position system (EAPS) mounted over the mobile node in 3D space. In this paper we convert the real world problem into lab oriented problem by using the EAPS –system and shown the performance in wireless domain in 3 dimensional space.	bit error rate;ethernet automatic protection switching;hoc (programming language);network packet;simulation;software development;throughput	Soumen Kanrar;Mohammad Siraj	2010	CoRR		wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	1.5097725406519482	87.25265186925898	168309

When WMNs is used as an infrastructure for Internet access, all network traffic from mesh routers will be forwarded to the gateways that are directly connected to the wired network. Communication in large-scale wireless networks may suffer capacity bottlenecks in the gateway and local congestions among the mesh routers. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid strategy which combines the gateway-based and path-based traffic control schemes. In order to obtain simple and efficient results, the k-level congestion awareness scheme is proposed which uses the fuzzy logic technique to estimate the gateway loading. The border nodes (BNs) will redirect partial traffic to adjacent regions that belong to neighbor gateways if congestion occurs. Therefore, the proposed scheme can adjust the network traffic automatically according to traffic condition that can smoothly and immediately share traffic load to neighbor gateways. The validity of the model has been demonstrated through simulation experiments. Our simulation results have also indicated that our scheme is a good choice for WMNs to support efficient congestion control, especially in bursty traffic environments.	bottleneck (software);experiment;fuzzy logic;internet access;network congestion;network packet;network traffic control;redirection (computing);serial experiments lain;simulation;smoothing;wireless mesh network	Pei-Jung Lin;Chyi-Ren Dow;Lu-Hui Huang;Shiow-Fen Hwang	2011	2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005755	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;network traffic control;logic gate;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;shared mesh;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	0.15045726625107306	84.43374427105793	168431
8c4ade38d94c0fabdbc895f3ea9e35b55d33086e	pocs- and uniform description of interference-based routing metric design for mg wmns		In this study, routing metric design for multi-gateway (MG) wireless mesh networks (WMNs) where partially overlapped channels (POCs) are used for data transmissions is investigated. POCs, multiple gateways and routing are effective solutions for capacity improvement in WMNs. Previous research designs routing metrics for WMNs where only orthogonal channels (OCs) are used. As interference estimation of POCs is quite different from that of OCs, these routing metrics are not suitable for POCs WMNs. In this paper, a light-weight uniform description of interference-based routing metric is proposed, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first routing metric specifically designed for MG POCs WMNs. Equivalent bandwidth is defined to capture the unique characteristics of POCs WMNs accurately, and gateways are also paid close attention to. This metric combines the optimal gateway selection together with the optimum path selection, and simulation results show that it can help select low-interference and light-load paths to light-load gateway for data flows.	interference (communication);mesh networking;metrics (networking);mg (editor);routing;simulation;wireless mesh network	Jihong Wang;Wenxiao Shi	2017	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2016.1066	computer network;mathematics;metrics;wireless mesh network;default gateway;interference (wave propagation);communication channel;bandwidth (signal processing)	EDA	-4.0572756494382185	84.19425860054915	168647

We design a virtual force-based controlled mobility scheme, named VFPc, and evaluate its ability to be jointly used with a dual packet-forwarding and epidemic routing protocol. In particular, we study the possibility for end-users to achieve synchronous communications at given times of the considered scenarios. On this basis, we study the delay distribution for such user traffic and show the advantages of VFPc compared to other packet-forwarding and packet-replication schemes, and highlight that VFPc-enabled applications could take benefit of both schemes to yield a better user experience, despite challenging network conditions.

This duplication can be avoided through the use of fast prototyping development processes, which enable reusing simulation code in real prototyping and in production environments. Although this functionality is already available by using ns-3 emulation, there are still limitations regarding the additional packet processing that emulation introduces, which degrades the node's performance and limits the amount of network traffic that can be processed.  In this paper we propose an approach to reduce the performance problem associated with fast prototyping that consists in migrating data plane operations processing to outside of ns-3. In a well-designed network, most of the traffic should be data. By moving the data plane operations outside of ns-3 the overhead associated with this kind of traffic is greatly reduced, while control plane protocols may still be reused.  In order to validate our proposed solution, we extended the Wireless Metropolitan Routing Protocol (WMRP) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocols to use the developed architecture, tested their performance in real environments, and verified the amount of code reuse between the simulator and the real system.	code reuse;communications protocol;control plane;emulator;forwarding plane;link-state routing protocol;network packet;network traffic control;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);prototype;simulation	Helder Fontes;Tiago Cardoso;Manuel Ricardo	2016		10.1145/2915371.2915374	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;hardware emulation	Networks	-0.36083574203441066	87.44405007720323	169524

This paper presents a framework for Balanced Consistency Maintenance (BCoM) in structured P2P systems with heterogeneous node capabilities and various workload patterns. Replica nodes of each object are organized into a tree structure for disseminating updates, and a sliding window update protocol is developed for consistency maintenance. We present an analytical model to optimize the window size according to the dynamic network conditions, workload patterns and resource limits. In this way, BCoM balances the consistency strictness, object availability for updates, and update propagation performance for various application requirements. On top of the dissemination tree, two enhancements are proposed: (1) a fast recovery scheme to strengthen the robustness against node and link failures, and (2) a node migration policy to remove and prevent bottlenecks allowing more efficient update delivery. Simulations are conducted using P2PSim to evaluate BCoM in comparison to SCOPE [1]. The experimental results demonstrate that BCoM outperforms SCOPE with lower discard rates. BCoM achieves a discard rate as low as 5 percent in most cases while SCOPE has almost 100 percent discard rate.	bottleneck (software);computer simulation;immutable object;peer-to-peer;queueing theory;replication (computing);requirement;smoothing;software propagation;tree structure	Yi Hu;Laxmi N.

MANETs can be used to set up a temporary mean of communication by having nodes behave as hosts and routers, with packets hopping between nodes to reach the destination node. This makes MANET suitable for rapid deployment, but because of the dynamic changes in network configurations, quickly finding the optimum route is difficult. In this study, the authors propose a biology-inspired ant routing protocol based on ant colony optimisation called as optimised antnet global positioning system, which is based on GPS and mobile software agents modelled on ants for routing in ad-hoc networks. The authors compare the performance of the authors protocol with Antnet, ad-hoc on-demand distance vector, Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad-hoc On Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) protocols with respect to end-to-end delay, average throughput, packet delivery ratio and route cost.	ant colony optimization algorithms;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;routing	Deepak Chatrabhuj Karia;Vaibhav Godbole	2013	IET Networks	10.1049/iet-net.2012.0087	wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;engineering;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.276027929848405	84.04590232730959	169700

A routing protocol is very important to keep communication quality over radio multi-hop communications because radio waves are impacted much by surrounding environment. When we use multi user shared applications such as a video conference and an IP phone, it is predicted that a large amount of traffic flows on networks. Therefore, we should consider network loads to use these applications. In this paper, we propose a multicast routing protocol for WMNs which considers network loads and hop count. The proposed protocol calculates Load Evaluation Value (LEV) of all candidate routes using their queue length and hop count. After that, it selects one route which has lowest LEV as a transmission route. As a result, by using the proposed method, it is possible to avoid high load routes. Furthermore, we evaluate performance of the proposed protocol and MAODV by simulation. In the simulation results, we show that the proposed protocol has better performance than MAODV.	mesh networking;multi-user;multicast;performance evaluation;radio wave;routing;simulation;transmission (bittorrent client);wireless mesh network	Kiyotaka Oe;Akio Koyama;Leonard Barolli	2013	2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2013.50	wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;multicast;inter-domain;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;xcast;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.4268540319479526	86.34438757439108	170030

Investigations show the influence of different target objectives on the channel assignment and network topology, demonstrate the proposed approach's load balancing properties in mesh networks containing multiple gateways, show the effect of 802.11a adjacent channel interference on the channel assignment, and compare the performance of the proposed procedure with a rate-based channel assignment scheme.	end-to-end principle;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;mesh networking;network topology;optimization problem;testbed;throughput;topology control;wireless mesh network	Theodoros Dionysiou;Vasilios A.

Forwarding in such networks relies on selecting relays to carry and deliver data to destinations upon opportunistic contacts. Due to the intermittent network connectivity, relays in current forwarding schemes are selected separately in a distributed manner. The contact capabilities of relays hence may overlap when they contact the same nodes and cause forwarding redundancy. This redundancy reduces the efficiency of resource utilization in the network, and may impair the forwarding performance if being unconsciously ignored. In this paper, based on investigation results on the characteristics of forwarding redundancy in realistic mobile networks, we propose methods to eliminate unnecessary forwarding redundancy and ensure efficient utilization of network resources. We first develop techniques to eliminate forwarding redundancy with global network information, and then improve these techniques to be operable in a fully distributed manner with limited network information. We furthermore propose adaptive forwarding strategy to intentionally control the amount of forwarding redundancy and satisfy the required forwarding performance with minimum cost. Extensive trace-driven evaluations show that our schemes effectively enhance forwarding performance with much lower cost.	exploit (computer security);forwarding plane;global network;mobile device;operability;relay	Wei Gao;Qinghua Li;Guohong Cao	2015	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2014.2333756	bidirectional forwarding detection;virtual routing and forwarding;real-time computing;adaptability;mobile telephony;cisco express forwarding;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;packet forwarding;redundancy;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	2.4354817953956545	85.13442491427185	170476

The protocol is resource-efficient, robust, flexible, and scalable. In addition, our protocol is provably loop-free.Our protocol starts with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) and individual receivers switch to a QoS-competitive tree (Source-Based Tree) when necessary. In both trees, the new destination is able to choose the most promising among several paths. An innovation is that we use dynamic routing information without relying on a link state exchange protocol to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect of pre-configuration decisions drastically, by separating the management from the data transfer functions; administrative routers are not necessarily part of the tree. This separation increases the robustness, and flexibility of the protocol. Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adapt dynamically to the conditions of the network.The QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas that make it more flexible than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many of the other protocols, (such as YAM, PIMSM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as special cases of QoSMIC. This paper presents the motivation behind, and the design of QoSMIC, and provides both analytical and experimental results to support our claims.	border gateway multicast protocol;communications protocol;link-state routing protocol;quality of service;robustness (computer science);router (computing);scalability	Michalis Faloutsos;Anindo Banerjea;Rajesh Pankaj	1998		10.1145/285237.285276	internet protocol;multicast;the internet;user datagram protocol;quality of service;adaptive routing;zone routing protocol;internet layer;resource reservation protocol;internet protocol control protocol;protocol independent multicast;computer science;link control protocol;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;computer security;computer network;open shortest path first	Networks	-4.436755707711856	86.83204538565795	171621

Even though there have been a number of studies about modeling MINs in the literature, almost all of them are for trends MINs under uniform traffic which dose not reflect the realistic. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the performance of ATM switches based on MINs with the small clock cycle (SCC) scheme under nonuniform traffic. Here MINs of 6 and 10 stages with built-in buffer modules holding single or multiple cells are considered for the evaluation. Comprehensive computer simulation results present that the proposed model is effective for predicting the performance of ATM switches under the realistic nonuniform traffic. It also shows that the detrimental effect on the hot spot traffic which is typical in the Internet turns out to be more significant as the switch size increases.	multistage interconnection networks	Hyunseung Choo;Youngsong Mun	2003		10.1007/3-540-44863-2_46	computer simulation;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;hot spot;community structure;statistics;computer network	Arch	-4.369960683542693	87.95877606599161	171919

In other words, the mobile ad hoc network has only symmetric links. However, since nodes consume battery power independently according to their computing and communication load, there exist asymmetric links, which means that node A is within node B’s transmission range, but not vice versa. This paper present two protocols that accomodate asymmetric links: link-level and endto-end Approaches. The link-level approach can be applied to any routing protocols by utilizing GPS(Globa1 Positioning System) location information of nodes at link level. On the other hand, the end-to-end approach does not need GPS devices and employs dual paths between source and destination. Simulation results reveal that these protocols cope well with ad hoc network having asymmetric wireless links under the presence of mobility.	end-to-end encryption;existential quantification;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);routing;simulation	Dongkyun Kim;Chai-Keong Toh;Yanghee Choi	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.965940	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.4211453017094073	83.55226075437122	172856

The inherent sharedmedium nature of the wireless mesh networks, however, poses fundamental challenges to the design of effective routing policies that are optimal with respect to the resource utilization. Node churns and traffic fluctuations exacerbate such a problem. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive routing algorithm for multiple subscribers in wireless mesh networks. We view a mesh network with multiple nodes as an entity that optimizes some global utility function constrained by the underlying MAC layer interference. By solving the optimization problem, the network is driven to an efficient operating point with a certain routing policies for each node. We then use this operating point information to adaptively find better paths, which is able to gear the network towards optimal routing.

Earlier research has proposed several unipath routing protocols specifically on MANET, but most studies have not focused on the limitations of battery resource. However, the single path is easily broken and needs to perform a route discovery process again due to the dynamic topology of ad hoc networks. To alleviate these problems, a new routing algorithm called ant-based stable multipath routing algorithm (ABSMRA) is proposed. ABSMRA is based on swarm intelligence and especially on the ant colony based meta heuristic. The proposed algorithm can consider link stability and provide the most stable path to route according to probability. The introduced routing algorithm is highly adaptive, efficient and scalable. Simulation results indicate that ABSMRA has a higher packet delivery ratio, lower end-to-end delay and lower routing load than AODV.	algorithm;ant colony;end-to-end principle;heuristic;hoc (programming language);metaheuristic;multipath routing;network packet;scalability;simulation;swarm intelligence	Zhengyu Wu;Xiangjun Dong;Lin Cui	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.244	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;geography;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.4896325208667966	83.60039740503511	173349

Though clustering of nodes can aid forwarding decision in these delay tolerant networks (DTNs), the clustering process is extremely costly in a large network. In this paper, we introduce a generic efficient clustering method which is suitable for grouping the nodes of large networks. We also demonstrated how encounter frequencies of public transport networks can be fed to that clustering algorithm in order to build clusters of nodes. And finally, our large scale extensive simulation study on real bus traces shows the efficacy of clustering in packet forwarding.	algorithm;cluster analysis;delay-tolerant networking;dynamic programming;experiment;network packet;simulation;tracing (software);xslt/muenchian grouping	Shabbir Ahmed;Salil S.

Still, most routing protocols assume symmetric links. Thus, they cannot exploit the additional connectivity and bandwidth that asymmetric links provide. In this paper, we propose an extension of the scalable source routing protocol (SSR) that enables SSR to use asymmetric links. It enhances SSR's hello messages with a limited amount of local topology information, which allows the nodes to discover directed cycles in the network. Such cycles provide a return path in cases where the forward path contains asymmetric links. With our proposed extension, SSR can thus use asymmetric links and still guarantee bidirectional connectivity. We evaluate our proposals with extensive simulations. A practical test in a 150 node test bed is ongoing work.	average path length;bounce address;hoc (programming language);inbound marketing;scalability;scalable source routing;simulation;testbed	Pascal Birnstill;Pengfei Di;Thomas Fuhrmann	2010	2010 The 9th IFIP Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)	10.1109/MEDHOCNET.2010.5546852	geography;telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-0.1488309149660668	83.39069745944029	174971

Heuristic algorithm HMCOP proposed by Korkmaz et al. has been widely recognized for its low time complexity and high probability of finding feasible solutions. In this paper, the performance of this heuristic is reinvestigated under several special cases. Simulation results indicate that in some cases its probability of finding feasible solutions is unexpectedly low. Such observation, which is further used to explain the performance of a heuristic based on HMCOP, would be of extreme importance when designing any higher-level QoS routing algorithms that need to use HMCOP to find feasible solutions.	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);mcop;packet delay variation;quality of service;routing;simulation;time complexity;unicast	Gang Feng	2004		10.1109/AINA.2004.1283754	mathematical optimization;routing;real-time computing;np-complete;jitter;quality of service;strontium;computer science;probability;communication complexity;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;computer network	Metrics	-3.2790833591746393	83.65168371079018	175328

FSR introduces the notion of multi-level fisheye scope to reduce routing update overhead in large networks. Nodes exchange link state entries with their neighbors with a frequency which depends on distance to destination. From link state entries, nodes construct the topology map of the entire network and compute optimal routes. Simulation experiments show that FSR is simple, efficient and scalable routing solution in a mobile, ad hoc environment.	experiment;fisheye;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;overhead (computing);scalability;simulation	Guangyu Pei;Mario Gerla;Tsu-Wei Chen	2000			optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;fisheye state routing;wireless routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;vehicular ad hoc network;computer network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;computer science	Mobile	2.549815143162285	82.01712390042604	175734

We propose two metrics for measuring the reliability of wireless mesh routing topologies, one for flooding and one for unicast routing. The Flooding Path Probability (FPP) metric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when each node broadcasts a packet after hearing from all its upstream neighbors. The Unicast Retransmission Flow (URF) metric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when a relay node retransmits a unicast packet on its outgoing links until it receives an acknowledgement or it tries all the links. Both metrics rely on specific packet forwarding models, rather than heuristics, to derive explicit expressions of the end-to-end packet delivery probability from individual link probabilities and the underlying connectivity graph. We also propose a distributed, greedy algorithm that uses the URF metric to construct a reliable routing topology. This algorithm constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from a weighted, undirected connectivity graph, where each link is weighted by its success probability. The algorithm uses a vector of decreasing reliability thresholds to coordinate when nodes can join the routing topology. Simulations demonstrate that, on average, this algorithm constructs a more reliable topology than the usual minimum hop DAG.	directed acyclic graph;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;graph (discrete mathematics);greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);mathematical model;mesh networking;multipath routing;network packet;open reading frame;relay;retransmission (data networks);sl (complexity);unicast;wireless mesh network	Phoebus Chen;Karl Henrik Johansson;Paul N.

The photonic network is based on a passive star-coupled WDM–based configuration with high topological connectivity and low complexity. The channels are pre-allocated to the nodes with this approach, where each node has a home channel that it uses either for all data packet transmissions or all data packet receptions. A home channel may be shared if the number of nodes exceeds the number of channels in the system. This approach does not require both tunable transmitters and tunable receivers. The performance of a generalized random access protocol is compared to a protocol based on interleaved time multiplexing. Both protocols are designed to operate in a multiple-channel multiple-access environment and require each node to possess a tunable transmitter and a fixed (or slow tunable) receiver. Semi-markov analytic models are developed to investigate the performance of the two protocols. The analytic models are validated through simulation and performance is evaluated in terms of network throughput and packet delay with variations in system parameters.	access control;markov chain;network packet;random access;simulation;throughput;transmitter;wdma (computer);wavelength-division multiplexing	Krishna M.

All of the four proposed schemes are path-based and deadlock-free. The first scheme, dual-path routing, sends the message in parallel through two independent paths. The second one, shortcut-node-based datapath routing, is similar to dual-path routing except that the routing tries to find a shortcut node to route the message as soon as possible to reduce the length of transmission path. The third one, multipath routing, is a multiple dual-path routing strategy that includes source-to-relay and relay-to-destination phases. The last scheme, proximity grouping routing, is similar to multipath routing except that in the partitioning step of source and destination nodes the relation of spatial locality of nodes is also taken into account to reduce the length of transmission paths. Finally, the experimental results are given to show that the performance based on unicast-based and traditional Hamiltonian-path routing schemes can be improved significantly by the four proposed routing schemes respectively.	multicast;routing	Tzung-Shi Chen;Neng-Chung Wang;Chih-Ping Chu	1998		10.1109/ICPADS.1998.741096	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;parallel computing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;information management;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	HPC	2.1508931179226782	81.70367199411785	176730

As in conventional caching, it leverages the presence of local caches at the end users. However, it considers coding in the caches and/or coded transmission from the central server and demonstrates that huge savings in transmission rate are possible when the server and the end users are connected via a single shared link. In this work, we consider a more general topology where there is a layer of relay nodes between the server and the users, e.g., combination networks studied in network coding are an instance of these networks. We propose novel schemes for a class of such networks that satisfy a so-called resolvability property and demonstrate that the performance of our scheme is strictly better than previously proposed schemes.	cache (computing);digital distribution;internet;linear network coding;mike lesser;relay;server (computing)	Li Tang;Aditya Ramamoorthy	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541333	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	-2.9893590756449924	86.2395772831044	177245

Diversified environmental conditions are expected to vary network performance. In fact, obstacles, buildings and/or mountains may act as either barriers, or source of noise for the radio signals. Nevertheless, most of the previous performance evaluation studies based on simulation, neglected this consideration; they used simulation models that were too simplistic, and too narrow (i.e. idealistic) in their scopes. With this paper we propose a new, complete and realistic Urban Mobility Model (UMM). It models realistically users motion, and radio signals propagation in a citylike scenario. Our aim is to study the effects of realistic network simulation on routing performance. The results prove that a realistic scenario with roads and buildings has a significant impact on routing.	hoc (programming language);network performance;performance evaluation;routing;semantic network;simulation;software propagation	Stefano Marinoni;Hannu Kari	2006	International Conference on Networking, International Conference on Systems and International Conference on Mobile Communications and Learning Technologies (ICNICONSMCL'06)	10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.39	maintenance engineering;wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;marine technology;computer network	Robotics	2.3820289395999588	85.86548406584022	177781

The main goal of these algorithms is to offer services that satisfy the QoS requirements of individual users while guaranteeing at the same time an efficient utilization of network resources. This paper proposes a novel game theoretical model that solves the joint problem of non-cooperative QoS routing and dynamic capacity allocation in a parallel links network. Two categories of players are introduced: (1) the capacity players that dimension the link capacities to provide QoS guarantees to users, minimizing, at the same time, the links' congestion, and (2) network users, which are characterized by elastic traffic demands and split their traffic over multiple links, maximizing their objective function. This game is modeled as a multi-leader-follower game, where capacity players are leaders and network users are followers. We derive optimal routing and capacity settings using a round robin greedy algorithm, discussing numerical examples that provide insights into the model's solution.	converge;game theory;greedy algorithm;iterative method;loss function;network congestion;noise-equivalent power;numerical analysis;optimization problem;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;round-robin scheduling;routing	Jocelyne Elias;Fabio Martignon	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502598	game theory;greedy algorithm;simulation;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	-4.129301173819735	85.18497463436233	177938

The dynamics of the link disruptions complicate the routing problem; successful and stable routing operations of conventional routing approaches are hindered as the level of disruption increases. The target is to develop a robust and efficient routing approach in a single structure. A robust routing approach means a packet should be delivered to a destination even under severe disruptions. Efficient routing should deliver a packet with the shortest path at no disruption. These goals should be achieved with the maximum utilization of preexisting network components and with the minimal human intervention once installed. Therefore, we chose a popular conventional routing scheme, Link State, and add-ons that can learn changing network environment. Our approach is to add a learning agent and a simple routing scheme to Link State in order to automatically select a better routing scheme at an arbitrary level of disruption. Markov Decision Process is employed to model this problem.

If a conventional multicast routing protocol is used in wireless mobile networks, several problems may be experienced since existing multicast routing protocols assume static hosts when they construct the multicast delivery tree. To overcome the problems, several multicast routing protocols for mobile hosts have been proposed. Although the protocols solve several problems inherent in multicast routing proposals for static hosts, they still have problems such as non-optimal delivery path, datagram duplication, overheads resulting from frequent reconstruction of a multicast tree, etc. In this paper, we summarize these problems of multicast routing protocols and propose an efficient multicast routing protocol based on IEFT mobile IP in wireless mobile networks. The proposed protocol introduces a multicast agent, where a mobile host receives a tunneled multicast datagram from a multicast agent located in a network close to it or directly from the multicast router in the current network. While receiving a tunneled multicast datagram from a remote multicast agent, the local multicast agent may start multicast join process, which makes the multicast delivery route optimal. The proposed protocol reduces data delivery path length and decreases the amount of duplicate copies of multicast datagrams. We examined and compared the performance of the proposed protocol and existing protocols by simulation under various environments and we got an improved performance over the existing proposals.	datagram;mobile ip;multicast;network packet;router (computing);routing;simulation	Young-Joo Suh;Hee-Sook Shin;Dong-Hee Kwon	2001	Wireless Networks	10.1023/A:1016780525280	wireless routing protocol;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;non-broadcast multiple-access network;inter-domain;reliable multicast;mbone;protocol independent multicast;computer science;operating system;wireless network;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;mobile computing;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	1.4685460798744348	83.02094008852843	180365

We characterize network topology and routing. The former includes network connectivity and diameter, node degree distribution, clustering, and frequency of topology changes. The latter includes route length distribution, route asymmetry, frequency of route changes, and packet delivery ratio. Results show a high degree of topology and route changes, even when mobility is low, and a prevalence of asymmetric routes, both of which contradict assumptions commonly made in MANET simulation studies. Our data sets will be made publicly available for use by other researchers.	cluster analysis;degree distribution;diameter (protocol);hoc (programming language);interoperability;maniac i;network packet;network topology;routing;simulation	Vivek Srivastava;Amr B.

Several potential applications of Vehicular Networks are envisioned such as road safety and security, streaming services, traffic monitoring and driving comfort, just to mention a few. It is critical that the existence of convenience or driving comfort services do not negatively affect the performance of safety services. In essence, the dissemination of safety services or the discovery of convenience applications require the communication among service providers and service requesters through constrained bandwidth resources. Therefore, service discovery techniques for vehicular networks must efficiently use the available common resources. In this paper, we present a bandwidth-efficient and scalable hybrid adaptive service discovery protocol (VSDP) for Vehicular Networks. VSDP aims at providing high success ratio while guaranteeing low response time and good scalability when the number of requests increases. Our proposed protocol finds the service provider and its routing information simultaneously which results in overall bandwidth savings. It uses diverse channels to exchange discovery and routing packets, thereby decreasing the congestion on single channels and decreasing the delay of service discovery. Our proposed service discovery protocol adapts the advertisement zone size of service providers based on an efficient adaptation mechanism that takes into consideration network condition and application requirements. The adaptation process is based on an adjustment technique and a prediction technique. We discuss the implementation of our protocol, present its proof of correctness as well as the performance evaluation through an extensive set of simulation experiments and using different mobility models. Our results show the scalability of our protocol. They indicate that our techniques can achieve significant success rate (more than 90 percent), while guaranteeing low response time (in the order of milliseconds) and low bandwidth usage when compared to existing service discovery techniques.	correctness (computer science);experiment;network congestion;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;requirement;response time (technology);routing;scalability;service discovery;simulation;software propagation;superword level parallelism;website monitoring	Kaouther Abrougui;Azzedine Boukerche;Richard Werner Nelem Pazzi;Mohammed Almulla	2014	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2013.147	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;service discovery;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-1.111482273699497	85.27314395311852	181210

LCP shows better performance compared to one of the most popular ad hoc routing algorithm, called Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) , for various network scenarios, particularly with the clustered layout of nodes. This node arrangement is more practical in many potential MANE T application areas and is contrasted with the random layo ut that most of previous MANET research assumed. Even though nodes are not uniformly scattered, the underlying cluste r architecture based on LCP algorithm constructs a number of clusters quite uniformly in the network area and thus the adverse effect of non-uniform node arrangement can be effectively avoided. We measured the packet delivery ra te, delay, and control overhead for evaluating the LCP based on ns-2 network simulator and found that the major benefit comes the reduced routing control overhead especially around hot spots where nodes are overly cluttered.

Geocast target areas can be specified either by geometric figures or symbolic addresses, such as /usa/f 1/miami/market-street. In this paper, we present a novel geocast routing protocol for symbolically addressed messages. Compared to geocast protocols based on geometric information, our protocol can operate on simple symbolic location models, and message forwarding does not require costly geometric operations. The proposed protocol is based on an overlay network that is mapped to an IP-based network infrastructure. The overlay network is structured in a hierarchical fashion, to ensure a scalable global geocast service supporting also large target areas. Although our protocol does not rely on a layer 3 multicast protocol, we also show how to improve the performance of message forwarding by integrating a light-weight layer 3 multicast protocol. Our evaluations of the protocol underline the scalability of our approach and show good routing quality leading to short message paths.

To this end, automatic service discovery is an important feature of mobile ad hoc networks (Manets). In this paper a service discovery protocol for Manets based on the IETF Service Location Protocol has been implemented in the NS-2 simulator. Its performance is studied under different mobility patterns, network sizes and number of service agents. A lightweight quality of service (QoS) aware service discovery protocol is also proposed to support QoS applications.

We use a block based acknowledgement and selective retransmission protocol to evaluate the impact of the loss rate and the multicast tree topology on the achievable throughput. Our results show that even when the buuer overrow probability at switches and receivers is low, the cumulative loss probability seen by a source may be quite high. We also demonstrate that the average throughput increases signiicantly if the transport protocol delivers packets to the application layer out-of-sequence. We investigate the scaling properties of the error control mechanism and show that the mul-ticast tree topology that results in minimum transfer time is not necessarily the same as the one constructed using minimal bandwidth or shortest path algorithms.	algorithm;error detection and correction;image scaling;multicast;network switch;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;shortest path problem;throughput;tree network	Pravin Bhagwat;Partho Pratim Mishra;Satish K.

A mesh network placement provides coverage, such that each target client location has a link to a deployed mesh node, and connectivity, such that each mesh node wirelessly connects directly to a gateway or via intermediate mesh nodes. Prior work on placement assumes wireless propagation to be uniform in all directions, i.e., an unrealistic assumption of circular communication regions. In this paper, we present approximation algorithms to solve the NP- hard mesh node placement problem for non-uniform propagation settings. The first key challenge is incorporating non-uniform propagation, which we address by formulating the problem input as a connectivity graph consisting of discrete target coverage locations and potential mesh node locations. This graph incorporates non-uniform propagation by specifying the estimated signal quality per link. Secondly, our algorithms are the first to minimize the number of deployed mesh nodes with constant-factor approximation ratio in the non-uniform propagation setting. To achieve this, we formulate the Degree-Constrained Terminal Steiner tree problem and present approximation algorithms which leverage prior results on the Steiner tree problem. Third, it is impractical to measure all possible potential mesh links, and therefore deployment planning must rely on estimations. To address this challenge, we extend our algorithm to iteratively measure the links in the solution Steiner tree, refining the graph input on a per-link basis in order to ensure the deployed network is not disconnected. Finally, we use propagation measurements at 35,000 locations in the deployed GoogleWiFi network to investigate placement in a realistic, non-uniform propagation environment. Under this measured propagation setting, our algorithms result in up to 80% fewer mesh nodes than current algorithms and only require an average of 3 measurements per deployed mesh node to ensure backhaul connectivity.	approximation algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);google wifi;graph theory;mesh networking;multitier architecture;population;software deployment;software propagation;steiner tree problem;unit propagation;wireless mesh network;wireless router	Joshua Robinson;Mohit Singh;Ram Swaminathan;Edward W.

9f0c424380fcaf20e2d64d51cf4552b614db44d8	das transportprotokoll sctp: leistungsbewertung und optimierung eines neuen transportprotokolls		The new Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) was originally standardised for the transport of signaling messages – originating from the Common Channel Signaling System No.7 (SS7) – over IP based networks. Nonetheless, SCTP is a general purpose IP-based reliable transport protocol which is connection oriented and offers message based data transfer. It supports multiple independent message streams and flexible data delivery mechanisms. In contrast to TCP, SCTP protocol endpoints support multiple addresses (multihoming), and therefore an endpoint may be reached via different and possibly redundant network paths. Several SCTP enhancements, e.g. for partially reliable message transfer [ 82], are currently being proposed, and it is conceivable that SCTP is a suitable transport protocol for many established and future applications [ 5, 20]. In this thesis, the behaviour and performance of SCTP was investigated within different scenarios. A suite of tools were developed to this end: in a testbed environment, a Unix-based protocol implementation named sctplib was created for demonstrating SCTP fairness towards TCP, and the applicability of SCTP for signaling transport was investigated. Discrete event-based simulation models of the SCTP data path and some control path elements were created and validated against the results from the testbed experiments. These models were later enhanced to investigate the simultaneous use of several available paths (also named load sharing). From an operator perspective, load sharing is desirable for signaling transport at high network loads, even though it requires substantial protocol adaptations. Load sharing mechanisms from the literature were evaluated, and a number of modifications of these algorithms were suggested and evaluated, as well. It could be shown that the modifications of the existing load sharing algorithms that were developed within the scope of this dissertation indeed lead to an optimisation of the load sharing algorithms so far proposed, both in terms of overall throughput and maximum message delay that can be expected.	algorithm;communication endpoint;connection-oriented communication;experiment;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;message passing;multihoming;signalling system no. 7;simulation;testbed;throughput;unix	Andreas Jungmaier	2005			gynecology;physics	HPC	-3.7591314234536215	88.23076931235607	182726

Moreover, the nature of these systems creates significant challenges for the development of failure detection services (FDSs), because their quality often depends heavily on reliable communication. In particular, ad hoc wireless networks are notoriously vulnerable to message loss, which precludes deterministic guarantees for the completeness and accuracy properties of FDSs. To meet the challenges, we propose an FDS based on the notion of clustering. Specifically, we use a cluster-based communication architecture to permit the FDS to be implemented in a distributed manner via intra-cluster heartbeat diffusion and to allow a failure report to be forwarded across clusters through the upper layer of the communication hierarchy. In doing so, we extensively exploit the message redundancy that is inherent in ad hoc wireless settings to mitigate the effects of message loss on the accuracy and completeness properties of failure detection. As shown by our mathematical analysis, the resulting FDS is able to provide satisfactory probabilistic guarantees for the desired properties.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;family computer disk system;fault tolerance;hoc (programming language);population;scalability	Ann T.

The spatially and temporally diverse nature of ad hoc networks suggests the development of a more sophisticated network-layer that enables the network's nodes to choose their preferred routing protocol from an array of protocols with varying abilities. However, the configuration of such a dependent variable, and one with network-wide significance, is a non-trivial task in a distributed system. This paper focuses on the problems that arise in developing a configuration protocol which does not compromise the inherent distributed, open and infrastructure-independent traits of an ad hoc networking system. Self-stabilization is identified in this paper as a suitable technique on which to base such a robust and distributed autonomous configuration protocol. The protocol takes the form of a stateless configuration initialisation (SCl) protocol which is coupled with a configuration conflict detection & resolution (CCDR) protocol.	auto-configuration;autonomous robot;distributed computing;file synchronization;hoc (programming language);routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);self-stabilization;semantic network;stateless protocol	Timothy K.

In this paper, we implement a simulation system based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in order to solve the problem of mesh router placement in WMNs. We consider 4 replacement methods of mesh routers: Constriction Method (CM), Random Inertia Weight Method (RIWM), Linearly Decreasing Vmax Method (LDVM) and Linearly Decreasing Inertia Weight Method (LDIWM). We use Size of Giant Component (SGC) and Number of Covered Mesh Clients (NCMC) as metrics for optimization. From the simulation results, we found that the CM converges very fast but it has the worst performance among 4 replacement methods. The RIWM converges fast and the performance is good. The LDIWM is a combination of RIWM and LDVM. The LDVM converges after 170 number of phases but has a good performance.	algorithm;giant component;horner's method;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;router (computing);server-gated cryptography;simulation;wireless mesh network	Shinji Sakamoto;Tetsuya Oda;Makoto Ikeda;Leonard Barolli;Fatos Xhafa	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA)	10.1109/BWCCA.2015.53	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;mathematical optimization;computer science;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;particle swarm optimization;computer network	HPC	-2.250870721906224	82.0524980395207	183924

A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes forming a temporary network without using any centralized access point, infrastructure, or centralized administration. To establish a data transmission between two nodes, typically multiple hops are required due to the limited transmission range. Mobility of the different nodes makes the situation even more complicated. Multiple routing protocols especially for these conditions have been developed during the last years, to find optimized routes from a source to some destination. This paper presents performance evaluation of three different routing protocols i.e. LANMAR, LAR1 and Fisheye in variable pause times. Performance evaluation of these three protocols is based on Average end to end delay, TTL based hop count and Packet delivery ratio.	centralized computing;fisheye;performance evaluation;routing;transistor–transistor logic;wireless access point	Shaily Mittal;Prabhjot Kaur	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12214-9_65	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.3667520873983485	82.98270808983625	184921

In order to evaluate the performance of typical ad hoc routing protocols-in particular, we used Dynamic MANET On Demand (DYMO)-in such VANET scenarios, we combined microsimulation of road traffic and event-driven network simulation. Thus, we were able to analyze protocols of the Internet protocol suite in VANET scenarios with highly accurate mobility models. Varying parameters of DYMO for a multitude of traffic and communication scenarios helped point out approaches for improving the overall performance and revealed problems with the deployment. It could be shown that in realistic scenarios, even for medium densities of active nodes and low network load, overload behavior leads to a drastic decrease of the perceived network quality. Cross-layer optimization of transport and routing protocols therefore seems highly advisable.	event-driven programming;hoc (programming language);internet protocol suite;mathematical optimization;protocol stack;routing;simulation;software deployment;wireless access point	Christoph Sommer;Falko Dressler	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.20	vehicular ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	1.857698805711036	86.48200461982505	185203

The routing problem in this case involves the construction of a set of low cost multicast trees with bandwidth requirements for all the group members in the network. The traditional solutions only care for the low cost of multicast trees and sometimes the algorithms will fail during the construction due to the inefficiency of the bandwidth allocation. In this paper we study the feasible solutions to GMRP by proposing a new algorithm to improve the success rate of constructing multicast trees. Simulation results show that our new algorithm performed better in terms of bandwidth utilization and success rate of building multicast trees compared with existing algorithms.	algorithm;centralized computing;failure rate;greedy algorithm;multicast;network model;network topology;quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation	Ning Wang;Chor Ping Low	2000		10.1007/3-540-45551-5_19	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-2.7837944413827516	82.51781619350625	185565

One of the biggest obstacles to this goal is the intermittent nature of VANETs due to mobility. Traditional geo-routing algorithms do not perform well in these conditions because they drop packets whenever they cannot find an immediate forwarder for the packet. In this paper, we propose RobustGeo, a routing protocol that combines the simplicity and efficiency of the greedy forwarding technique in geo-routing algorithms, with the robustness of delay tolerant networks in the face of disruptions in network connectivity. When there exists a good connection between the source and destination, RobustGeo can route the packet like the traditional geo-routing algorithms, and when the network faces disruptions, RobustGeo relies upon vehicle mobility and packet replication to explore multiple georoute paths and quickly recover the packet back to greedy forwarding. We show that for a highly intermittent scenario, RobustGeo has a delivery ratio of over 20% (compared to a pure geo-routing protocol's delivery ratio of 0), and it reduces delay by over 40% as compared to a more pure delay-tolerant routing solution.	geographic routing;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);location-based service;network packet;overhead (computing);reliable messaging;schema (genetic algorithms)	Ruolin Fan;Yu-Ting Yu;Mario Gerla	2015	2015 24th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288461	wireless routing protocol;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;source routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;processing delay;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ip forwarding;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;packet forwarding;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.3975980225852123	83.44418002520273	185614

The enhancement attempts to increase the overall data packet delivery ratio by adding packet storage and retransmit operations coordinated by the multicast source. 1. Reliable Group Communication Reliable group communication has a relatively long history in wired networks. Reliable distributed group communication began with solutions to basic distributed problems and moved on to protocols for static group memberships. To get past certain limitations in the solutions for static memberships, the dynamic group membership model was proposed[1]. This introduced the concept of a Group Membership Service, responsible for group management. In this model a sender or third party based GMS has the following responsibilities: 1. handle group joins and leaves, 2. identify and remove ‘dead’ nodes from list, 3. distribute group membership list to group, 4. flush unresolved messages from system before new group view is distributed, 5. sequence all messages uniquely, 6. coordinate a reliable delivery protocol (2pc), 7. coordinate storage of messages for retransmit, and 8. retransmit stored messages to requesting nodes. In this model, an individual node has the following responsibilities: 1. receive, order and deliver messages to the app. layer, 2. originate and transmit new messages. In wired group communication protocols, research has differentiated between sender based and receiver based responsibility for reliable message delivery [2]. In a receiver-based model, a clear advantage is that no overall group membership list is necessary. For a receiver based model, the top four GMS responsibilities listed disappear, leaving four remaining. Additionally, a third responsibility is added to the individual nodes, to NACK unreceived messages. For the four remaining GMS responsibilities, this paper takes the following approach: sequencing messages uniquely can be a standalone problem, as can the coordination of message delivery. These two responsibilities provide message-ordering guarantees in wired networks. This paper focuses on a technique to coordinate the remaining two responsibilities of message storage and retransmission. Section 2 presents a brief overview of the ODMRP protocol, section 3 outlines the reliability enhancement, and finally section 4 concludes the paper. Though expired from IETF, ODMRP was chosen as the protocol to work with because simulations have shown it to be one of the most reliable ad hoc multicast protocols, short of flooding, created to date.	acknowledgement (data networks);allocate-on-flush;globalization management system;hoc (programming language);multicast;network packet;odmrp;reliable messaging;retransmission (data networks);simulation	Lawrence Klos;Golden G.

We have proposed two routing schemes namely AMIRA and AntMesh, which provide efficient data forwarding for improved load-balancing and reduced interference in single and multi-radio infrastructure mesh networks. Both of our proposed schemes are derived from the principle of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in which artificial ants (agents) perform the routing and data forwarding to stochastically solve a dynamic network optimization problem. The main focus in our work is to take advantage of the particular characteristics of ACO framework and exploit them in designing routing schemes for WMNs keeping in view the unique characteristics and requirements of these infrastructure mesh networks.	ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial ants;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;mesh networking;operand forwarding;optimization problem;requirement;routing;wireless mesh network	Fawaz S.

Several tools are available for simulating the behavior of MANETs: the main disadvantages of most of them concern the difficulties in managing the synchronization among the components involved in the simulation. Our research is aimed at building a tool, which is able to both modeling and simulating MANETs, so that synchronization and concurrency can be properly managed. In our research the tool DEMONE has been developed with the aim to build an environment for both modeling and simulating MANETs, and in which synchronization is established by the internal behavior of the hosts. In this paper the tool DEMONE is presented, and it is empirically validated through simulations. The results obtained in 3000 simulations are analogous to the findings reported in literature, but obtained with other simulators. This experience is an evidence of the ability of DEMONE in measuring performance of MANETs.

Mesh Routers, which are typically equipped with multiple radios, provide a wireless multi-hop backhaul. The resource constrained Mesh Clients also participate in the routing and forwarding of packets to extend the reach of the network. Current ad-hoc routing protocols have been designed for relatively homogeneous networks and do not perform well in Hybrid Wireless Mesh Networks. In this paper, we present HOVER (Hybrid On-demand Distance Vector Routing), a modified version of the AODV routing protocol, that achieves significant performance improvements in terms of packet delivery and latency in Hybrid Wireless Mesh Networks. Our modifications include a link quality estimation technique based on HELLO packets, a new routing metric that differentiates between node types, and a channel selection scheme that minimises interference in multi-radio mesh networks. We present an evaluation of our improvements via extensive simulations. We further show the practicality of the protocol through prototype implementation and provide measurement results obtained from our test-bed∗.	backhaul (telecommunications);computation;distance-vector routing protocol;experiment;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);metrics (networking);network packet;prototype;simulation;static mesh;testbed;the australian;throughput;wireless mesh network;arts	Stephan Mir;Asad Amir Pirzada;Marius Portmann	2008		10.1145/1378279.1378292	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;switched mesh;service set;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;telecommunications;engineering;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;mesh networking;ad hoc wireless distribution service;shared mesh;optical mesh network;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.136732401894617	85.25914264759562	186901

Traditional measurement-based routing schemes often ignore the interference from the coming RTC traffic itself (i.e. self-traffic), so they can not get an accurate quality estimation of the path to serve the coming RTC traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based routing metric, PPTT (Path Predicted Transmission Time), to estimate end-to-end delay of RTC traffics. PPTT is traffic-aware by taking explicit consideration of both self-traffic and neighboring traffics interfering with the RTC flow, and thus offers an accurate prediction of transmission delay. By selecting route with minimal PPTT, the quality of service for the coming RTC flow will be improved, in terms of end-to-end delay and goodput. To evaluate the performance, we implement PPTT scheme and study its performance in a wireless multi-hop test bed consisting of 32 nodes equipped with IEEE 802.11 a/b/g combo cards, and we also conduct extensive simulations with different random topologies in network simulator NS2 for a more comprehensive comparison. Experiment results show that this routing metric outperforms other non prediction-based routing metric such as ETX (Expected Transmission Count) and WCETT (Weighted Cumulative Expected Transmission Time) in terms of delay and goodput in wireless multi-hop networks.	etx (form factor);end-to-end principle;expected transmission count;goodput;interference (communication);metrics (networking);quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;testbed	Shouyi Yin;Yongqiang Xiong;Qian Zhang;Xiaokang Lin	2006		10.1145/1185373.1185409	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;end-to-end delay;network simulation;cluster analysis;computer network;cumulant;testbed	Mobile	0.8971888961320978	86.36780981171353	187016

Basing their forwarding decisions only on the local topology, geographic routing protocols have drawn a lot of attentions in recent years. However, inaccurate local topology knowledge and the outdated destination position information can lead to inefficient geographic forwarding and even routing failure. Proactive local position distribution can hardly adapt to the traffic demand. It is also difficult to pre-set protocol parameters correctly to fit in different environments. We have developed two self-adaptive on-demand geographic routing schemes. The local topology is updated in a timely manner according to network dynamics and traffic demands. Our route optimization scheme adapts the routing path according to both topology changes and actual data traffic requirements. Each node can determine and adjust the protocol parameter values independently according to different network environments, data traffic conditions and node's own requirements. Our simulation studies have shown that the proposed routing protocols are more robust and outperform the existing geographic routing protocol. Specifically, the packet delivery latency is reduced almost four times as compared to GPSR at high mobility.	communications protocol;geographic routing;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;network packet;proactive parallel suite;requirement;simulation	Xiaoling Xiang;Z.

This paper focuses on design and implementation advantages of the PlayNCool protocol in a real environment of wireless mesh networks. We provide a detailed protocol to implement PlayNCool that is independent from the other protocols in the current computer network stack. PlayNCool performance is evaluated using NS-3 simulations and real-life measurements using Aalborg University's Raspberry Pi test-bed. Our results show that selecting the best policy to activate the helper node is a key to guarantee the performance of PlayNCool protocol. We also study the effect of neighbor nodes in the performance of PlayNCool. Using a helper in presence of active neighbors is useful even if the channel from helper to destination is not better than the channel between sender and destination. PlayNCool increases the gain of end-to-end communication by two-fold or more while maintaining compatibility to standard wireless ad-hoc routing protocols.	hop-by-hop transport;linear network coding	Peyman Pahlevani;Hana Khamfroush;Daniel Enrique Lucani;Morten Videbæk Pedersen;Frank H.

Our results show that, depending on the sparsity of vehicles, the network re-healing time can vary from a few seconds to several minutes. This suggests that, a new ad hoc routing protocol will be needed as the conventional ad hoc routing protocols such as dynamic source routing (DSR) and ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) will not work with such long re-healing times.	ansi escape code;circuit restoration;distance-vector routing protocol;freeway;hoc (programming language);internet relay chat;network packet;network topology;simulation;source routing;sparse matrix	Nawaporn Wisitpongphan;Fan Bai;Priyantha Mudalige;Ozan K.

71a3181a801c9fd9d376a743add9338d33097565	iseff: an id-based scalable and efficient distributed file sharing technique in vehicular ad hoc networks	data sharing;distributed hash table;bittorrent protocol;vehicular ad hoc network	Using new wireless capabilities in vehicles, various applications have appeared in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Multimedia data sharing is one of these applications, which has recently been given so much attention. Most of presented schemes in this field have focused on direct opportunistic meetings between vehicles or request/response broadcast in the whole network, which are inefficient and un-scalable due to VANET characteristics. In this paper, we propose an ID-based Scalable and EFficient distributed File sharing technique that increases efficiency and scalability via taking advantages of BitTorrent protocol and consistent hashing technique. The results of simulations show that our approach increases the received file ratio, reduces total download time of files and message overhead. Consequently, it can enhance efficiency and performance.	file sharing	Nasrin Ahmadifard;Hamid Nabizadeh;Maghsoud Abbaspour	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1393-4	vehicular ad hoc network;bittorrent;computer science;chord;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;bittorrent tracker;internet privacy;computer network	Mobile	-0.6845075880660358	85.93953465628208	192495

Channel assignment in multi-radio mesh networks is complicated because, in addition to affecting the interference between spatially closely located links, binding interfaces to channels affects the topology of the network. If the channel assignment is done without taking the topology into consideration, distance between any two nodes may increase arbitrarily. We propose a novel distributed channel assignment algorithm that reduces interference and at the same time provides bounds on the distance between any two nodes in the topology resulting from channel assignment. Our algorithm is based on the concept of spanners. We also develop and implement a modification of AODV, which uses the cumulative metric WCETT [4] as the routing metric. We use this routing algorithm to analyze the performance of our channel assignment algorithm. Through extensive simulations in NS-2, we show that the proposed channel assignment algorithm provides nearly 30% improvement in throughput over a simple, minimal-connectivity preserving channel assignment algorithm.	distributed algorithm;interference (communication);mesh networking;metrics (networking);routing;simulation;throughput;wireless mesh network	C.

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a WMN by simulations considering packet delivery ratio (PDR), throughput and delay. For simulations, we used ns-3 simulator and Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP). We evaluate the performance of the WMN by sending multiple Constant Bit Rate (CBR) flows in the network. The simulation results show that for higher values of transmission rate and 30 connections, the delay and jitter increased very much, so the real-time applications, like video streaming, become difficult.	cost efficiency;design review (u.s. government);hybrid wireless mesh protocol;network packet;performance evaluation;real-time clock;simulation;streaming media;throughput;wireless mesh network	Makoto Ikeda;Tetsuya Oda;Elis Kulla;Masahiro Hiyama;Leonard Barolli;Muhammad Younas	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2012.89	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;wireless network;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;wi-fi array;computer network;broadband networks	Mobile	1.0009756649423887	87.43333759699105	193935

Self-organizing network is proverbially adopted by ECS due to its flexible and robust architecture. However, the moving range and mode of mobile node in self-organizing network, especially mobile gateway, constrain the coverage and adaptability of self-organizing network in ECS. In this paper, we design an ECS based on UAV-assisted self-organizing network, which helps nodes on the ground form a self-organizing network automatically. In addition, the system adopts UAV as strong relay nodes to form relay network in the air. We also add some humanized functions in the system to adapt to the needs of different environment, which includes positioning and messages pushing service. The proposed ECS can be easily deployed in the emergency environment and owes high communication efficiency.	android;diversification (finance);internet;mobile phone;openness;organizing (structure);relay;self-organization;smartphone;systems architecture;unmanned aerial vehicle	Tianhan Gao;Fan Lang;Nan Guo	2016	2016 10th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS)	10.1109/IMIS.2016.132	embedded system;broadcast communication network;telecommunications;mobile station;self-organizing network;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.449486821784424	87.44819635513754	194288

The schemes trade off between inefficiency of routes and various overheads. With the rapid growth of mobile computing, this overhead will give rise to the scalability issue of these schemes. However, there has been no quantitative study on the asymptotic scalability analysis of these schemes. In this paper, we have developed analytical models for scalability analysis of these schemes in terms of network size, mobility rate, distance between mobility agents, and traffic rate. Our analysis shows that the prefix delegation-based schemes exhibit asymptotically identical overhead on the network, and they show better asymptotical scalability in terms of number of mobile routers. The analytical framework for scalability analysis presented in this paper will help in visualizing the effects of future network expansion on the performance of these route optimization schemes of NEMO.	asymptote;mathematical optimization;mobile computing;optimization problem;overhead (computing);scalability	Md.

In this paper, we propose a QoS multi-tree based routing protocol for wireless mesh environments, named Inter-Mesh Infrastructure Proactive Routing (IMPR). It is a proactive multi-tree routing protocol enabling QoS guarantee for communications from/towards the Internet network through the Mesh Gateway (MG) of the mesh infrastructure. We describe and analyze the simulation results of different scenarios conducted on the network simulator ns-3 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our IMPR routing protocol in forwarding real-time applications with QoS guarantee.	quality of service;routing	Hajer Bargaoui;Nader Mbarek;Olivier Togni;Mounir Frikha	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-33936-8_16	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;border gateway protocol;zone routing protocol;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-0.7167100685577918	85.51884310345591	194942

Consequently, a fast response to connectivity changes is one of the most important challenges in MANETs. Most proactive routing protocols detect changes by exchanging control messages. The Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) specifies the exchange of these kind of messages. As shown in prior studies, the proposed fixed intervals of NHDP cause unnecessary protocol overhead or late link detection. Our Adaptive HELLO (AH) scheme adapts the interval dynamically with respect to the actual situation and coordinates it between the nodes when necessary. The result is a fast link change detection and an overhead reduction in certain scenarios.	global positioning system;network topology;overhead (computing);routing;self-tuning;speedup	Raphael Ernst;Peter Martini	2012	37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2012.6423663	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.5147521831067783	82.97580032094024	195725

One is the long path between the source and the destination, and the other is the high routing overhead. We study the both aspects and develop our schemes accordingly. Firstly, a new routing metric for selecting multi-channel routes with maximum end-to-end capacity is presented. Secondly, a feedback based algorithm to maximize the control message broadcasting interval is proposed to minimize the routing overhead, offering more residual capacity for data traffic while keeping the routes reliable.

The first enhancement, CGR-ETO, aims to improve the accuracy of predicted bundle delivery time by considering the available information on queueing delay. The second, the Overbooking Management, aims to proactively handle contact oversubscription, which occurs when high priority bundles are forwarded for transmission on a contact that is already fully subscribed by lower priority bundles. Both enhancements have been inserted as optional features in the Interplanetary Overlay Network CGR implementation in order to comparatively evaluate their performance on a GNU/Linux testbed running the full protocol stack. The results show that the two enhancements are complementary and can significantly improve routing decisions compared to standard CGR.	algorithm;experiment;gnu;linux;load balancing (computing);open-source software;overlay network;overselling;priority queue;protocol stack;queuing delay;r. daneel olivaw;routing;testbed	Nikolaos Bezirgiannidis;Carlo Caini;D.

A simulation environment (Simulation Environment for Ad Hoc Networks, SAHNE) will be presented that allows simulation of communication strategies in MANETs that use sector subdivision, and simulation results will be shown where communication paths are selected via hop-minimization or geometric spanner properties. SAHNE is based on C++ and common libraries, which ensures that it can be used on many different platforms. The experiments show the influence of different parameters in realistic szenarios, and using geometric routing seemed to be better than using hopminimization.	accessibility;algorithm;c++;channel (communications);christof ebert;diploma;experiment;geometric spanner;hoc (programming language);library (computing);michael j. fischer;routing;simulation;subdivision surface;transmitter	Klaus Volbert	2002		10.1109/EMPDP.2002.994324	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Robotics	1.5093454491509515	82.02583685126477	196814

Our algorithm assigns to each node of the network a virtual coordinate in the hyperbolic plane, and performs greedy geographic routing with respect to these virtual coordinates. Unlike other proposed greedy routing algorithms based on virtual coordinates, our embedding guarantees that the greedy algorithm is always successful in finding a route to the destination, if such a route exists. We describe a distributed algorithm for computing each node's virtual coordinates in the hyperbolic plane, and for greedily routing packets to a destination point in the hyperbolic plane. (This destination may be the address of another node of the network, or it may be an address associated to a piece of content in a Distributed Hash Table. In the latter case we prove that the greedy routing strategy makes a consistent choice of the node responsible for the address, irrespective of the source address of the request.) We evaluate the resulting algorithm in terms of both path stretch and node congestion.	distributed algorithm;distributed hash table;geographic routing;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);network congestion;point-to-point protocol;scalability	Robert D.

In the Tree-turn model, links are classified as either a tree link or a cross link and six directions are associated with the channels of links. Then we can prohibit some of the turns formed by these six directions such that an efficient deadlock-free routing algorithm, Tree-turn routing, can be derived. There are three phases to develop the Tree-turn routing. First, a coordinated tree for a given topology is created. Second, a communication graph is constructed based on the topology and the corresponding coordinated tree. Third, the forwarding table is set up by using all-pairs shortest path algorithm according to the prohibited turns in the Tree-turn model and the directions of the channels in the communication graph. To evaluate the performance of the proposed Tree-turn routing, we develop a simulator and implement Tree-turn routing along with up*/down* routing, L-turn routing, and up*/down* routing with DFS methodology. The simulation results show that Tree-turn routing outperforms other routing algorithms for all the test cases.	deadlock;dijkstra's algorithm;distributed file system (microsoft);floyd–warshall algorithm;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;speedup;test case;throughput	Jiazheng Zhou;Yeh-Ching Chung	2010	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-010-0477-0	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;machine learning;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	1.7969752540666657	81.75937192295254	198867

Existing MANET routing protocols set up an end-to-end path between source and destination prior to data forwarding. Maintaining a connected path before data delivery may not work well when the network is partially disconnected or disrupted. This paper discusses Opportunistic Multi-link Delay Tolerant Routing (OMDTR) which is designed to provide data delivery in the network where fully connected network topology is not guaranteed. OMDTR learns the local network connectivity and deliver the data if there is connectivity within two-hop. OMDTR exploits the robustness of flooding-based routing when there is no local network connectivity. Performance measurements of OMDTR protocol show that OMDTR increases the data delivery compared to pure flooding-based routing and pure end-to-end routing in mobile multi-hop wireless network with relatively high and low network density.	delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);lossy compression;mobile phone;network topology;operand forwarding;routing table;simulation	Cherry Ye Aung;Peter Han Joo Chong;Xinxing Zhao;Anthony Chua Yong Pheng;Tiah Khoon Ng;See Xinyou;Kok Siong Lai	2013	2013 9th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing	10.1109/ICICS.2013.6782952	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.6955721427594774	84.1126359047481	199336

Prior approaches have proposed smart flooding using location information, carry and forward, and GeoServer assisted algorithms. Due to the complexity and overhead imposed by these approaches, their applications are restricted to local information transfer, dissemination of popular content, or delay-tolerant scenarios. In this work, we propose FastMF to extend both accessibility of the Internet for vehicular nodes and reachability of vehicular nodes from any remote server. Furthermore, by forming clusters of vehicles with similar mobility patterns, leveraging cluster to infrastructure links, and maintaining the mapping between node IDs and network addresses in a logically centralized server, we provide the nodes without a direct Internet connection with the benefit of an indirect association to an Internet gateway. Results from NS3 experiments illustrate the improvements in throughput and delay in various mobility scenarios.	accessibility;algorithm;broadcast radiation;centralized computing;connected car;experiment;gateway (telecommunications);internet protocol suite;overhead (computing);reachability;server (computing);systems design;throughput	Mehrnaz Tavan;Roy D.
