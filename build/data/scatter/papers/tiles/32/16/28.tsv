We investigate the interaction between these two popular categories of traffic and find that many solution approaches, such as enhanced TCP variants, priority queues, bandwidth limitation, and traffic shaping, do not always achieve the coexistence goals. Enhanced TCP variants (Reno, Vegas, C-TCP, CUBIC, Westwood) generally fail to protect VoIP in wired-wireless multihop scenarios. Priority schemes, including those built into the 802.11 MAC such as RTS/CTS or 802.11e, do not account for the interference nature of wireless multihop. Finally, bandwidth shaping and window control are valid tools to control TCP, but come with their own trade-offs.	carpal tunnel syndrome;coexist (image);cubic function;interference (communication);network scheduler;noise shaping;priority queue;rs-232;traffic shaping;wireless router	Kyungtae Kim;Dragos Niculescu;Sangjin Hong	2009	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2009.5116803	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;voice over ip;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Mobile	-2.808180700013901	91.97372778000437	199325
