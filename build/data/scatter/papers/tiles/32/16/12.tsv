This paper presents a fuzzified T-S interpolation-approximation system mainly based on the specification of a multidimensional crisp partition that defines the corresponding local regions (multidimensional intervals) where the corresponding rules apply, the related output functions and a reduced set of global fuzzy parameters. These fuzzy parameters capture the different uncertainties of a fuzzy system: imprecision of inputs, vagueness of antecedent linguistic labels and smoothness requirements of outputs. This approach makes easier the design of a zero-order product-sum T-S system with fuzzified inputs, fuzzified antecedent crisp partition, and outputs with an additional spatial output filter. Convolution operations applied on an equalized and normalized input domain are considered to specify the corresponding fuzzification of a crisp partition. The kernels of these convolutions are even B-spline functions of order n, constructed from a n-fold convolution of an even interval characteristic function. We use a correctness-preserving transformation to simplify the output computation: a global transformation of imprecision of inputs, vagueness of antecedent terms and smoothness requirements of outputs into a set of off-line convolution operations applied to the corresponding antecedent crisp partition. By this method a fuzzified zero-order T-S system defined on a multidimensional crisp partition is directly transformed into a multidimensional spline interpolator-approximator by means of fuzzy operations and an equalization-normalization of the corresponding input domain.	interval arithmetic	Felipe Fernández;Julio Gutiérrez	2003	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/S0165-0114(02)00249-X	spline;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;nonlinear control;interpolation;mathematics;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system;statistics	Logic	2.4819012085910472	-23.07021375451288	159509

The approach presented in this paper generalizes the classical definition of fuzzy partition as defined by Ruspini, which is now conceived as a quite often desirable objective that can be usually obtained only after a long learning process. In addition, our model allows the evaluation of the resulting classification, according to several indexes related to covering, relevance and overlapping.	fuzzy classification	Ana del Amo;Javier Montero;Greg S.

In this paper, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set is used to capture fuzziness in multi-criteria decision making problems. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new method for solving multi-criteria decision making problem in interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environments. First, we introduce and discuss the concept of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy point operators. Using the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy point operators, we can reduce the degree of uncertainty of the elements in a universe corresponding to an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set. Then, we define an evaluation function for the decisionmaking problem to measure the degrees to which alternatives satisfy and do not satisfy the decisionmaker’s requirement. Furthermore, a series of new score functions are defined for multi-criteria decision making problem based on the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy point operators and the evaluation function and their effectiveness and advantage are illustrated by examples.	evaluation function;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;intuitionistic logic;nl-complete;numerical aperture;set theory	Chunqiao Tan;Benjiang Ma;Desheng Dash Wu;Xiaohong Chen	2014	International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems	10.1142/S0218488514500238	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;fuzzy number;linear partial information;mathematics;score;fuzzy set operations;statistics	AI	-2.4110115818026903	-20.89219878543298	161658

By SetF(Ω) we denote a category of sets with similarity relations (A,δ) with values in Ω. We investigate an interpretation of a first order predicate fuzzy logic in a model based on objects of this category SetF(Ω). A notion of a fuzzy set in this category is introduced and interpretation of formulas as fuzzy sets are defined.

Such generalization allows to recover the usual fuzzy implication properties when dealing with interval-valued fuzzy implications. In addition, the condition under which the converse construction, i.e. the generation of fuzzy implications by action of K-operators and interval-valued fuzzy implications, is discussed. Moreover, we analysed their conjugate construction obtained by action of interval automorphisms. Through commutative diagrams, the associativity related to compositions of conjugate, dual and K-operators performed over fuzzy implications is shown, also preserving their main properties.	expert system;fuzzy set;information theory;ka band;logical connective;set theory;verse protocol	Renata Hax Sander Reiser;Benjamín R.

Such a production model, which is assumed to be linear, can be formulated as mathematical programming problems with fuzzy parameters from the viewpoint of experts’ imprecise or fuzzy understanding of the nature of parameters in a problem-formulation process. It is shown that a cooperative game with values of coalitions represented by fuzzy numbers arises from the linear production programming problem with fuzzy parameters, and such a game is referred to as a fuzzy linear production programming game. The values of coalitions of the game can be obtained by employing a parametric approach to solving the linear production programming problem with fuzzy parameters. It is proven that the   α  -core of the game is not empty, and an interval in the   α  -core is computed by using the ideas of sensitivity analysis and the duality theory of linear programming problems.

51142e8ff18e30eb7ce4f96e0682a2d3464b2027	construction of fuzzy multiple deferred state sampling plan		All traditional acceptance sampling plan are constructed with crisp proportion of defective items (p). But in the manufacturing processes, p may not be precisely known. So, in this paper fuzzy multiple deferred state sampling plan by attribute is proposed in the presence of imprecise p by applying fuzzy sets theory and probability theory. Here, the authors concentrate more on a specific case of developed plan for preparing a table to find its parameters for given specified fuzzy acceptable and limiting quality levels. Also, some practical examples are given to be fully informed. The obtained results show that the proposed plan not only is well-defined, but also has higher discriminatory power than fuzzy single sampling plan with zero and one acceptance numbers.	firing squad synchronization problem;fuzzy set;sampling (signal processing)	Robab Afshari;Bahram Sadeghpour Gildeh	2017	2017 Joint 17th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association and 9th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (IFSA-SCIS)	10.1109/IFSA-SCIS.2017.8023269	mathematical optimization;machine learning;fuzzy logic;artificial intelligence;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy set;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;probability theory;sampling (statistics);computer science;acceptance sampling;fuzzy number	Robotics	0.30570009247816265	-18.735336323119597	162798

In this paper, the OWA operators with uncertain weights such as interval or weak ordinal descriptions, coupled with interval input arguments, are presented in order to identify the superior course of action among a multitude of courses of action. With the help of relaxation of information representation, a burden of information specification imposed on decision maker can be, to some extent, relieved, and thus with regard to the parameters, we can obtain a less-specific expression that renders human judgments readily available. To perform the OWA aggregation, we take into account the strength of preference based on a probabilistic measure and present a way of ordering the input arguments specified by interval numbers as well as two heuristic algorithms to allocate uncertain weights to the ordered input arguments for prioritizing the courses of action.	algorithm;heuristic;linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator;ordinal data;rendering (computer graphics);vagueness	Byeong Seok Ahn	2007	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2007.895945	heuristic;decision-making;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;uncertainty;computer science;knowledge-based systems;probability;mathematics;fuzzy set;statistics	Vision	-0.5843453587656575	-17.972348976125105	164189

6cfcc077ff631c5940d9a940c8844c7d5a5df232	a new approach for solving intuitionistic fuzzy transportation problem of type-2		In solving real life transportation problem, we often face the state of uncertainty as well as hesitation due to various uncontrollable factors. To deal with uncertainty and hesitation many authors have suggested the intuitionistic fuzzy representation for the data. In this paper, we formulate a transportation problem in which costs are triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. We have defined accuracy function using score functions for membership and non membership functions of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Then ordering of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers using accuracy function has been proposed. We have utilized this ordering to develop methods for finding starting basic feasible solution in terms of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Also the same ordering is utilized to develop intuitionistic fuzzy modified distribution method for finding the optimal solution. Finally the method is illustrated by a numerical example which is followed by graphical representation and discussion of the finding.	fuzzy transportation;transportation theory (mathematics)	Sujeet Kumar Singh;Shiv Prasad Yadav	2016	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-014-1724-1	discrete mathematics;fuzzy transportation;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy classification;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	-2.5170932395459276	-19.68191371912621	164639
bc73c8facba09b8a8cbe2273d1c04a998afb0efa	typical hesitant fuzzy negations		Since the seminal paper of fuzzy set theory by Zadeh in 1965, many extensions have been proposed to overcome the difficulty for assigning the membership degrees. In recent years, a new extension, the hesitant fuzzy sets, has attracted a lot of interest due to its usefulness to handle those problems in which it is difficult to provide accurately a single membership value; since for hesitant sets, membership values are given by a whole set of values. On the other hand, since fuzzy negations have an important role in applications as well as in the theoretical approach to of fuzzy logics, it is important to study an extension of the concept of fuzzy negation for hesitant fuzzy degrees (elements). In this paper, we propose such a definition and we study some of the main properties of this new concept. C © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;john d. wiley;set theory	Benjamín R.

Fuzzy control problems connected with fuzzy correspondence inequations and equations are considered. A fuzzy correspondence is fixed, while the solutions are investigated for the input and output fuzzy sets which are unknown. First we prove that these solutions can be analyzed and formulated in crisp framework, solving the corresponding cut problems. Further, the space of solutions of an inequation is proved to be a complete lattice; the same holds for the space of solutions of the corresponding equation. In case the membership values belong to an infinitely distributive lattice (frame), the solutions can be found in specified intervals; moreover, we were able to locate in such intervals minimal and maximal solutions of these problems.

When data are crisp, conventional DEA models are used. However the values of inputs and outputs in many cases are imprecise and vague. In addition, most of these data are expert-based. Thus, taking into account expert's reliability is quite important. In this paper we propose a Z-number version of the CCR (named after Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes) and BCC (named after Banker, Charnes and Coopers) DEA models. The proposed method can be converted into the fuzzy DEA model when experts are confident about their opinions. Also, it can be converted into the conventional DEA models when the inputs and outputs are crisp numbers. In this study, the Z-number DEA model is transformed into possible linear programming and then by applying an alternative α-cut approach, a crisp linear programming model is obtained. Furthermore, the proposed model is applied to a portfolio selection problem in IS/IT (Information Systems/Information Technology) project to tackle uncertainties, interactions between projects and reliabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that presents a unique Z-number DEA model.

In accordance with this connection we introduce a new constructive method for (weak) fuzzy subsethood measures for interval-valued fuzzy sets based on the aggregation of fuzzy interval implications. For this purpose we generalize aggregation functions and propose a technique for aggregation of intervals. The benefit of our approach lies in the wide range of obtained fuzzy subsethood measures for interval-valued fuzzy sets. Moreover, the method gives the possibility to construct new fuzzy subsethood measures with properties that are appropriate to the situation under investigation. Another advantage of the method is its clear semantic interpretation.	fuzzy set	Zdenko Takác	2016	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/j.fss.2015.03.022	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;membership function;defuzzification;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;fuzzy subalgebra;fuzzy number;fuzzy measure theory;mathematics;lipschitz continuity;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations	NLP	-1.1389161103015486	-22.089097489878498	165827

As is well known, FMP is far more general and complicated than the conventional rule of modus ponens (MP) and takes the latter as special case under certain conditions.

f26debfa371c92ab480f03921a1e694884e5c9de	a linear programming method based on an improved score function for interval-valued pythagorean fuzzy numbers and its application to decision-making		The present paper proposes an improved score function for solving multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem with partially known weight information, In it, the preferences related to criteria are taken in the form of interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Based on these preferences and an improved score function, a score matrix has been formulated and then a linear programming based method has been proposed to solve MCDM problems with unknown attribute weights. Some generalized properties have also been proven for justification. Illustrative examples have been given for showing the superiority of the approach with the other existing functions in the decision-making process.	linear programming	Harish Garg	2018	International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems	10.1142/S0218488518500046	multiple-criteria decision analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;fuzzy set;matrix (mathematics);score;linear programming;fuzzy number;pythagorean theorem	Robotics	-2.769040067457193	-19.97029746721609	167630

In order to cut down the computational complexity of the direct approach to performing type-1 OWA operation, the α-level approach to type-1 OWA operators was developed. This new approach is based on the decomposition of a type-1 OWA operator via its α-levels and the corresponding Representation Theorem of type-1 OWA operators. A close inspection of the mathematical representation of the centroid of type-2 fuzzy sets reveals that this is a special case of type-1 OWA operator. This relationship will allow for the computation of the centroid of a general type-2 fuzzy sets to be carried out via the application of the representation theorem to its equivalent type-1 OWA representation.	computation;computational complexity theory;fuzzy set;object composition;type-1 owa operators;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems	Francisco Chiclana;Shang-Ming Zhou	2011		10.2991/eusflat.2011.138	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;membership function;defuzzification;fuzzy classification;fuzzy number;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations	AI	-1.390088481265919	-22.921009818017758	167780

For the Choquet integral we replace the product operator joining the values of a capacity m of criteria sets and values of a score vector by a fusion function F satisfying some constraints, similarly as was already done for another form of the discrete Choquet integral by Mesiar et al. in [15]. For the Sugeno integral we use an analogous method of generalization replacing the minimum operator by a fusion function. The properties of the obtained functionals C F m and S F m are studied and some examples for particular capacity m and particular fusion function F are given.

It is argued that the essence of the satisficing process is captured by the satisfaction relation, i.e., a relation between decisions and their corresponding satisfactory criterion sets. This relation leads directly to a characterization of the satisficing process in terms of isotonic spaces, extended topologies, and two special classes of filters, neighborhood-convergent systems. In this context it is possible to specify maximal product subrelations of the satisfaction relation, e.g., for a given criterion, set one can uniquely specify the largest set of decision elements which are satisfactory. These maximal product subrelations define filters on the decision set and criterion set which exhibit a fundamental property of the satisficing process-the balance principle. The satisfaction process is shown to be a generalization of optimization and other decisionmaking strategies. The filter systems on the decision and criterion sets form complete distributive lattices. Furthermore, the isotonic spaces associated with the satisfaction relation are closure spaces closely related to combinatorial geometrics, which are considered a generalization of vector spaces.	isotonic regression;mathematical optimization;maximal set;recurrence relation	Robert F.

This methodology utilizes fuzzy γ-model as an information aggregation operator. It provides several advantages due to the fact that the input to each model is the evidence supplied by the degree of satisfaction of sub-criteria and the output is the aggregated evidence. We also generalize fuzzy γ-models as a hierarchical network in this work. Thus, the decision making process is to aggregate and propagate the evidence information through such a hierarchical network. This trainable network is able to perceive and interpret complex decisions by using those fuzzy models. The simulation study examines the learning behaviors of the fuzzy γ-models using two numerical examples.	fuzzy concept	Jung-Hsien Chiang;Yau-Hwang Kuo	2000	International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools	10.1142/S021821300000029X	fuzzy cognitive map;membership function;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy transportation;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;linear partial information;data mining;information fuzzy networks;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;artificial neural network;fuzzy control system;hybrid system	DB	-1.813260586483454	-19.787008698660017	168219

We introduce an extension of the Analytical Hierarchy Process using the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators. This extension, which generalizes the aggregation process used in the AHP, allows more flexibility in the formulation of higher order concepts and provides the AHP an even greater facility for modeling human decision making. Using the OWA operators we are able to model situations where the number of sub-criteria needed to satisfy a higher order concept can be expressed in terms of linguistic quantifiers.	analytical hierarchy	Ronald R.

While many types of similarity measures exist for type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy sets, there are very few similarity measures that enable the comparison of general type-2 fuzzy sets. In this paper, we introduce a general method for extending existing interval type-2 similarity measures to similarity measures for general type-2 fuzzy sets. Specifically, we show how similarity measures for interval type-2 fuzzy sets can be employed in conjunction with the zSlices based general type-2 representation for fuzzy sets to provide measures of similarity which preserve all the common properties (i.e. reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and overlapping) of the original interval type-2 similarity measure. We demonstrate examples of such extended fuzzy measures and provide comparisons between (different types of) interval and general type-2 fuzzy measures.	fuzzy measure theory;fuzzy set;similarity measure;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;vertex-transitive graph	Josie McCulloch;Christian Wagner;Uwe Aickelin	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2013.6622408	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;membership function;defuzzification;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy subalgebra;fuzzy number;fuzzy measure theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations	Visualization	-2.0594134740870413	-22.07891085348461	168845

In the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the decision makers express their preferences using judgement matrices (i.e., multiplicative preference relations). Also, the geometric consistency index is suggested to measure the individual consistency of judgement matrices, when using row geometric mean prioritization method (RGMM), one of the most extended AHP prioritization procedures. This paper further defines the consensus indexes to measure consensus degree among judgement matrices (or decision makers) for the AHP group decision making using RGMM. By using Chiclana et al.'s consensus framework, and by extending Xu and Wei's individual consistency improving method, we present two AHP consensus models under RGMM. Simulation experiments show that the proposed two consensus models can improve the consensus indexes of judgement matrices to help AHP decision makers reach consensus. Moreover, our proposal has two desired features: (1) in reaching consensus, the adjusted judgement matrix has a better individual consistency index (i.e., geometric consistency index) than the corresponding original judgement matrix; (2) this proposal satisfies the Pareto principle of social choice theory.

This theory provides a new mathematical tool for indeterminacy phenomena. Uncertain variable is a fundamental concept in uncertainty theory and used to represent quantities with uncertainty. There are some important characteristics about uncertain variables. The expected value of uncertain variable is its average value in the sense of uncertain measure and represents the size of uncertain variable. The variance of uncertain variable provides a degree of the spread of the distribution around its expected value. The moments are some other important characteristics of an uncertain variable. In order to describe the moment of uncertain variable, this paper provides a new formula using inverse uncertainty distribution. Several practical examples are provided to calculate the moments using inverse uncertainty distribution. In addition, some new formulas are derived to calculate the central moments of uncertain variables through uncertainty distribution and inverse uncertainty distribution.	indeterminacy (philosophy);modern portfolio theory;propositional variable;uncertainty theory;variable (computer science)	Yuhong Sheng;Samarjit Kar	2015	FO & DM	10.1007/s10700-014-9193-1	uncertainty theory;econometrics;mathematical optimization;uncertainty analysis;mathematics;moment;sensitivity analysis;statistics	ML	0.7728238491507409	-19.618699531411632	169434

We consider parametric ordinal models for such pairwise comparison data involving a latent vector w∗ ∈ R that represents the “qualities” of the d items being compared; this class of models includes the two most widely used parametric models– the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and the Thurstone models. Working within a standard minimax framework, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal error in estimating the quality score vector w∗ under this class of models. The bounds depend on the topology of the comparison graph induced by the subset of pairs being compared via its Laplacian spectrum. Thus, in settings where the subset of pairs may be chosen, our results provide principled guidelines for making this choice. Finally, we compare these error rates to those under cardinal measurement models and show that the error rates in the ordinal and cardinal settings have identical scalings apart from constant pre-factors.	bsd;computer science;electrical engineering;karp–lipton theorem;minimax	Nihar B.

702174a6da30394b596fd97d7621c8fe8eac3626	the complex neutrosophic soft expert set and its application in decision making		This paper presents a novel complex neutrosophic soft expert set (CNSES) concept. The range of values of CNSES is extended to the unit circle in the complex plane by adding an additional term called the phase term which describes CNSES’s elements in terms of the time aspect. CNSES is a hybrid structure of soft sets and single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) defined in a complex setting where the experts’ opinions are included, thus making it highly suitable for use in decision-making problems that involve uncertain and indeterminate data where the time factor plays a key role in determining the final decision. Based on this new concept we define some concepts related to this notion as well as some basic operations namely the complement, union, intersection, AND and OR. The basic properties and relevant laws pertaining to this concept such as the De Morgan’s laws are also verified. Lastly, we propose an algorithm to solve complex neutrosophic soft expert decision-making problem by converting it from the complex state to the real state and subsequently provided the detailed decision steps. This study is supported by the comparison with other existing methods.	algorithm;complement (complexity);de morgan's laws;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;morgan;nondeterministic algorithm;relevance;theory	Ashraf Al-Quran;Nasruddin Hassan	2018	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/JIFS-17806	machine learning;mathematics;artificial intelligence	AI	-3.313338074946298	-21.84783301778508	170323

The first method by Herrera-Viedma appeared in the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part B: Cybernetics [vol. 37, no. 1 (2007) 176-189], while the second one by Fedrizzi and Giove appeared later in the European Journal of Operational Research [vol. 183 (2007) 303-313]. The underlying concept driving both methods is the additive consistency property. We show that both methods, although different, are very similar. Both methods derive the same estimated values for the independent-missing-comparison case, while they differ in the dependent-missing-comparison case. However, it is shown that a modification of the first method coincides with the second one. Regarding the total reconstruction of an incomplete preference relation, it is true that the second method performs worse than the first one. When Herrera-Viedma 's method is unsuccessful, Fedrizzi-Giove's method is as well. However, in those cases when Fedrizzi-Giove's method cannot guarantee the successful reconstruction of an incomplete preference relation, we have that Herrera-Viedma 's method can. These results lead us to claim that both methods should be seen as complementary rather than competitors in their application, and as such, we propose a reconstruction policy of incomplete fuzzy preference relations using both methods. By doing this, the only unsuccessful reconstruction case is when there is a chain of missing pairwise comparisons involving each one of the feasible alternatives at least once.	aequidens sp. jenaro herrera;computer-aided software engineering;estimated;eventual consistency;fuzzy concept;giove;ieee systems, man, and cybernetics society;missing data;operations research;partial;solutions;utility functions on indivisible goods;volume	Francisco Chiclana;Enrique Herrera-Viedma;Sergio Alonso	2009	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2023923	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computational intelligence;data mining;mathematics;fuzzy set;statistics	Vision	-0.5369997174237088	-19.688442141094274	171512
e54d220bf173b43dec02d6d9c9a4e134e4ee3a4f	a novel solution approach for fuzzy linear bilevel multi-follower programming problems		Decision making problems which are inherently hierarchical come under the category of multi-level programming problems. Whenever the hierarchy of problems is limited to two levels, the multi-level programming problem becomes a bilevel programming problem. Classical bilevel problems contain a leader problem subject to its constraints, and a follower problem subject to its own constraints. The follower problem acts as a constraint for the leader problem. However, in real practical cases, there may be a number of followers that constrain the solution space of the leader problem. Moreover, there may be certain impreciseness prevailing in the quantification of the resources of both the leader and the follower problems. In this paper, we deal with linear bilevel programming problems with multiple followers, which suffer from uncertainty, calling them fuzzy linear bilevel programming problems with multiple followers. While many solution approaches for such problems have already been introduced, we propose a novel defuzzification and K-th best algorithm based solution approach in this paper. Relevant results with a suitable numerical example have also been shown.	algorithm;branch and bound;defuzzification;experiment;feasible region;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;numerical analysis;vertex enumeration problem	Taniya Seth;Pranab K.

In this contribution is proposed a new discriminative dynamic index to handling differences in temporal behavior of alternatives, which are not discriminated in preceding dynamic approaches. An example is provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed index.

In this paper, we investigate the optimization decision problem of supplier selection in green procurement under the mode of low carbon economy. Concretely, we construct a new evaluation system for green supplier selection by considering commercial criterion and environmental criterion, and then present a decision method with 2-tuple linguistic assessments for green supplier selection. In this proposed decision method, all original decision data are transformed into linguistic 2-tuples, and then a ranking method based on 2-tuple weighted averaging (TWA) operator and 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging (TOWA) operator is presented to rank all alternative suppliers. Moreover, we provide an application decision making example of green supplier selection and compare our method with the method of linguistic 2-tuple Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (LT-TOPSIS) to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our decision method.	akaike information criterion;decision problem;distortion;mathematical optimization;procurement;program optimization	Zhuo Hu;Congjun Rao;Yue Zheng;Dong Huang	2015	Int.

This paper develops an extended TOPSIS method with an inclusion comparison approach for addressing multiple criteria group decision-making problems in the framework of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Considering the relative agreement degrees and the importance weights of multiple decision makers, this paper presents a modified hybrid averaging method with an inclusion-based ordered weighted averaging operation for forming a collective decision environment. Based on the main structure of the TOPSIS method, this paper utilizes the concept of inclusion comparison possibilities to propose a new index for an inclusion-based closeness coefficient for ranking the alternatives. Additionally, two optimization models are established to determine the criterion weights for addressing situations in which the preference information is completely unknown or incompletely known. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated by a medical group decision-making problem. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. . Introduction The TOPSIS method, which was developed by Hwang and Yoon [21], is a widely used compromising method for handling multiple criteria ecision-making problems. The basic rationale of the TOPSIS method is that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from he positive-ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative-ideal solution. The criterion weights in the TOPSIS method are given priori. Moreover, the positive-ideal solution and the negative-ideal solution are directly generated from the decision matrix [23]. In the lassical TOPSIS method, all of the decision data are precisely known or are given as crisp values. However, it can be difficult to determine he data precisely because human judgments are often vague under many conditions in practice. Therefore, numerous studies have been onducted on the extended TOPSIS methods within a fuzzy environment [1,2,8,14,19,20,29,30,50]. The extension of the TOPSIS method to he fuzzy environment makes it possible to address more imprecisions and uncertainties in the multiple criteria evaluations in the real orld. Since the introduction of fuzzy sets, many attempts have been made to generalize the notion of fuzzy sets. Among others, Atanassov and argov [6] proposed the concept of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs), which are generalizations of the intuitionistic fuzzy ets [3–5]. The IVIFS is characterized by a membership function and a non-membership function, which have values that are intervals ather than exact numbers. Xu [41] defined the notion of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (IVIFN) and introduced some perations on IVIFNs. The IVIFS theory provides an intuitive and computationally feasible method for handling uncertain and ambiguous roperties. The IVIFSs have significant advantages when addressing imprecise and imperfect information and have been applied in a variety Please cite this article in press as: T.-Y.

The PROMETHEE II method is an important ranking method which can comprise preferences as well as indifferences, and it has a unique characteristic that can provide different types of preference functions. Based on the advantages of the PLTS and the PROMETHEE II method, in this paper, we extend the PROMETHEE II method to process the probabilistic linguistic information (PLI), and propose the PL-PROMETHEE II method with an improved possibility degree formula which can avoid the weaknesses from the original formula. Then concerning the multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems with totally unknown weight information, the maximum deviation method is used to get the objective weight vector of the attributes, and net flows of the alternatives from the PROMETHEE II method are used to rank the alternatives. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.	fuzzy logic;granular computing;numerical analysis;pl/i;preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation	Peide Liu;Ying Li	2018	Informatica, Lith.

879e977add5c8adcbdac042a52c859e7b890e0fd	applications of soft sets in k-algebras		Most of the problems in engineering, medical science, economics, environments, and so forth, have various uncertainties. The problems in system identification involve characteristics which are essentially nonprobabilistic in nature. In response to this situation, Zadeh [1] introduced fuzzy set theory as an alternative to probability theory. Uncertainty is an attribute of information. In order to suggest amore general framework, the approach to uncertainty is outlined by Zadeh [2]. Molodtsov [3] initiated the concept of soft set theory as a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainties. In soft set theory, the problem of setting the membership function does not arise, whichmakes the theory easily applied to many different fields including game theory, operations research, Riemann integration, and Perron integration. At present, work on soft set theory is progressing rapidly. After Molodtsov’s work, some operations and application of soft sets were studied by many researchers including Ali et al. [4], Aktaş and Çağman [5], Chen et al. [6], and Maji et al. [7]. Maji et al. [7] gave first practical application of soft sets in decision making problems. To address decision making problems based on fuzzy soft sets, Feng et al. introduced the concept of soft level sets of fuzzy soft sets and initiated an adjustable decision making scheme using fuzzy soft sets [8]. It is interesting to see that soft sets are closely related to many other soft computing models such as rough sets and fuzzy sets. Feng et al. [9] first considered the combination of soft sets, fuzzy sets, and rough sets. Using soft sets as the granulation structures, Feng et al. [10] defined soft approximation spaces, soft rough approximations, and soft rough sets, which are generalizations of Pawlak’s rough set model based on soft sets. It has been proven that in some cases Feng’s soft rough set model could provide better approximations than classical rough sets. The algebraic structure of soft set theories has been studied increasingly in recent years. Aktaş and Çağman [5] defined the notion of soft groups. Feng et al. [11] initiated the study of soft semirings, and soft rings were defined by Acar et al. [12]. Jun [13] introduced soft BCK/BCI-algebras, and Kazancı et al. [14] introduced soft BCH-algebras. Along this direction, we apply soft set theory toK-algebras and investigate some of their properties. We introduce the notion of Abelian soft K-algebras and investigate some of their properties. We also introduce the concept of soft intersection soft K-algebras and investigate some of their properties.	approximation;bch code;entity–relationship model;fuzzy set;game theory;information;linear algebra;mv-algebra;operations research;rough set;set theory;soft computing;system identification	Noura Omair Alshehri;Muhammad Akram;Rania S.

PROMETHEE is a well-known and widely used outranking method, but it has not been investigated in depth within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Based on the concepts of inclusion comparison possibilities, this paper proposes inclusion-based generalized criteria to determine preference functions and global preference indices for acquiring leaving flows, entering flows, and net flows of alternative actions. Using the score functions and accuracy functions of the flows, this paper develops IVIF-PROMETHEE I and IVIF-PROMETHEE II, which are methods for the partial ranking and complete ranking, respectively, of alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated through a problem on the selection of bridge construction methods. Finally, a comparative discussion of other decision-making methods is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IVIF-PROMETHEE methods.	decision analysis;fuzzy set;preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation	Ting-Yu Chen	2015	FO & DM	10.1007/s10700-014-9195-z	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;data mining;mathematics;multiple-criteria decision analysis	SE	-3.6151860495447865	-19.8618221197715	174955

This paper addresses the spatial comparison of different landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) raster maps of the same area derived from various procedures. In hilly regions such as the Himalayas, occurrence of landslides is frequent, which necessitates the study of landslides in the region for future developmental planning. A critical aspect in landslide studies is the procedure for assignment of weights to various causative factors affecting the occurrence of landslides. A detailed study on conventional, artificial neural network (ANN) black box, fuzzy set based and combined neural and fuzzy weighting procedures for LSZ mapping in the Himalayas has recently been published by the authors in [Kanungo, D.P., Arora, M.K., Sarkar, S., Gupta, R.P., 2006. A comparative study of conventional, ANN black box, fuzzy and combined neural and fuzzy weighting procedures for landslide susceptibility zonation in Darjeeling Himalayas. Engineering Geology 85, 347–366]. The evaluation of various maps in that study was however based only on comparison of areal extents of various landslide susceptibility zones. In this paper, we present a spatial level comparative evaluation of those maps to get a detailed insight into the performance of each of the weighting procedures for landslide susceptibility zonation. The evaluation has been done through three approaches, viz., landslide density analysis, error matrix analysis and difference image analysis. Based on the landslide density values, it is inferred that the combined neural and fuzzy procedure for LSZ mapping appears to be significantly better than other procedures. The error matrix analysis highlights the significant difference between the conventional subjective weight assignment procedure and the objective combined neural and fuzzy procedure. Finally, the significant influence of a causative factor has been revealed by difference image analysis. The use of these spatial evaluation approaches in tandem may be highly beneficial to quantitatively assess the landslide susceptibility zonation or any other such maps. # 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Input and output information is presented in the form of linguistic meanings of qualitative characteristics. A method of formalization of these meanings as (L − R) fuzzy numbers is developed by the authors. The method of regression’s creation is based on the transformation of the input and output fuzzy numbers into intervals, which are called weighted intervals. The proposed method extends a group of initial data membership functions as it can be applied not only to normalized triangular fuzzy numbers, but also to (L−R) fuzzy numbers. The numerical example has demonstrated that the developed hybrid regression model can be used for analysis of relations among qualitative characteristics with success.	fuzzy number;input/output;least squares;numerical analysis	Olga Poleshchuk;Evgeniy Komarov	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-11960-6_18	membership function;defuzzification;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations	AI	-2.7475677993127823	-21.18053314602917	176233

Based on the multiplicative consistency property, a constrained nonlinear optimization model, which aims for making the induced matrix close to zero, is proposed to estimate the missing elements in the incomplete fuzzy reciprocal preference relation. The numerical example is illustrated to show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method not only estimates the missing elements accurately but also improves the multiplicative consistency, which makes the decision result derived from the incomplete fuzzy reciprocal preference relation could be scientific and effective.	algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;correctness (computer science);matlab;mathematical optimization;missing data;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yejun Xu;Qianqian Wang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015421	econometrics;fuzzy logic;nonlinear programming;preference relation;correctness;multiplicative function;reciprocal;matrix (mathematics);mathematics	Robotics	-2.1079506802040022	-19.075667878790668	176595

By placing restrictions on the set functions, we can get some good properties, such as a normalized output. To introduce a symmetric difference expression, some set functions are transformed into monotone set functions, and they can be interpreted by using fuzzy measure tools such as Shapley values. Similarly, we introduce a vector-valued Choquet integral for bi-capacities and their symmetric difference expressions. Despite from the vector-valued Choquet integral for set functions, the output values match with original and symmetric difference expressions.

The paper shows some new possibilities of solving difficult problems of computing with words which are offered by relative-distance-measure RDM models of fuzzy membership functions. Such models are based on RDM interval arithmetic. The way of calculation with words was shown using a specific problem of flight delay formulated by Lotfi Zadeh. The problem seems easy at first sight, but according to the authors’ knowledge it has not been solved yet. Results produced with the achieved solution were tested. The investigations also showed that computing with words sometimes offers possibilities of achieving better problem solutions than with the human mind.

Such algorithms usually seek to minimize the required storage at the price of inaccuracy in their output. This paper shows how to generalize every cardinality estimation algorithm that relies on extreme order statistics (min/max sketches) to a weighted version, where each item is associated with a weight and the goal is to estimate the total sum of weights. The proposed unified scheme uses the unweighted estimator as a black-box, and manipulates the input using properties of the beta distribution.	algorithm;black box;maxima and minima;weight function	Reuven Cohen;Liran Katzir;Aviv Yehezkel	2015	Inf.

1a3eaf6f6d1e3c845c9458a9349d765685a73104	probability calculation and element optimization of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preference relations based on expected consistency		As a generalized fuzzy number, the hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) has received increasing attention. However, it is noted that the occurring probabilities of the elements in the HFE are equal, which is obviously problematic; thus, the preference relations on the HFEs can be inaccurate. To address this issue, this paper proposes the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preference relations (PHFPRs) based on the probabilistic HFE (PHFE). It seems difficult to provide accurate probabilities that describe the occurring possibilities of the elements in the PHFPRs. This paper further demonstrates the probability calculation method for the PHFPEs based on a proposed variable, which is called the expected consistency. Moreover, the expected consistency index and the judgment principle are designed to evaluate the degree to which the PHFPRs are consistent. For the inconsistent PHFPRs, this paper presents an iterative optimization algorithm to improve their expected consistency by optimizing some elements in the PHFPRs. When the iteration terminates, the consistent PHFPRs and the priorities of the alternatives are identified. Finally, an example that selects a Ph.D. candidate is presented, and the results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the PHFPRs and the consistency methods.	algorithm;cladogram;fuzzy number;human factors and ergonomics;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;preference learning;probabilistic database	Wei Zhou;Zeshui Xu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2723349	artificial intelligence;fuzzy logic;machine learning;mathematics;probabilistic logic;mathematical optimization;fuzzy number	AI	-3.6672384520303654	-19.66656441823419	178425

When some observations are fuzzy, the efficiencies calculated are also fuzzy. This paper devises a method to ranking the fuzzy efficiency scores without knowing the exact form of the membership functions of the fuzzy efficiencies. The idea is to apply maximizing and minimizing set method which is usually applied when membership functions are known. Via a skillful modeling technique, the requirement of the membership functions is avoided. The efficiency rankings are consequently determined by solving a pair of nonlinear programs for each DMU. To illustrate how the proposed method in real world applications, the ranking of the twenty-four university libraries in Taiwan with fuzzy observations is exemplified.	mathematical optimization	Chiang Kao	2001		10.1109/FUZZ.2001.1007286	mathematical optimization;membership function;defuzzification;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;nonlinear programming;fuzzy classification;computer science;fuzzy number;machine learning;data mining;data envelopment analysis;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations	DB	-3.249277166037164	-17.091477033080466	178427

In this paper, several robust fuzzy data envelopment analysis (RFDEA) models are proposed by the use of different fuzzy measures including possibility, necessity and credibility measures. Despite the regular fuzzy DEA methods, the proposed models are able to endogenously adjust the confidence level of each constraints and produce both conservative and non-conservative methods based on various fuzzy measures. The developed RFDEA models are then linearized and numerically compared to regular fuzzy DEA models.

The existing methods of Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting method (FSAW) apply defuzzification which distorts fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, most of the methods usually require lengthy and laborious manipulations. In this paper, we develop a new a fuzzy simple additive weighting method for multiple attribute decision making problems. To avoid defuzzification round off errors caused by multiplication or other arithmetic manipulations, fuzzy numbers are ranked prior to any fuzzy arithmetic in this method. The ranking is done by preference ratio concept which compares fuzzy numbers pairwise. Since this method eventually assigns crisp scores to alternatives, it is practical and more realistic. We also present three other algorithms for ranking or normalizing fuzzy numbers which are actually sub algorithms of the main method.	additive model;algorithm;defuzzification;distortion;fuzzy number;horner's method;round-off error;utility functions on indivisible goods	Mohammad Modarres;Soheil Sadi-Nezhad	2005	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10642907.2005.10642907	defuzzification;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;machine learning;pattern recognition;fuzzy measure theory;data mining;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations	AI	-1.830188157667925	-20.555353959134305	181963

Then, based on the traditional TOPSIS method, calculation steps for solving interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multiple attribute decision-making problems with known weight information are given. The weighted Hamming distances between every alternative and positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution are calculated. Then, according to the weighted Hamming distances, the relative closeness degree to the positive ideal solution is calculated to rank all alternatives.

In this paper, we are going to propose a new method for aggregating individual ratio judgments into a group consensus. With the aggregation we proposed, the objective weight of each opinion is determined automatically in such a way that it is larger if the opinion is closer to the consensus and lesser otherwise. An iterative procedure is proposed to reach the consensus.

However, all of the critical values of the ordering index of above-mentioned three theories are subjectively fixed numbers. In this paper, for overcoming the lack of statistical meaning, an empirical distributive critical value of the ordering index based improved LOT theory, denoted as ILOT, was proposed, this new theory is more reasonable and useful than OT, IRS and LOT. Furthermore, by using the new method ILOT, based on the theory of the ideal test proposed by the first author of this paper, we can construct the validity index of item ordering structure of any group of examinees to compare the performances of any different groups of examinees.

However, now some popular structures, such as hesitant fuzzy sets and type-2 fuzzy sets, do not constitute fuzzy lattices. It limits applications of the theory of three-way decision spaces. So this paper attempts to generalize measurement on decision conclusion in three-way decision spaces from fuzzy lattices to partially ordered sets. First three-way decision spaces and three-way decisions are discussed based on general partially ordered sets. Then this paper points out that the collection of non-empty subset of 0, 1 and the family of hesitant fuzzy sets are both partially ordered sets. Finally this paper systematically discusses three-way decision spaces and three-way decisions based on hesitant fuzzy sets and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets and obtains many useful decision evaluation functions.	fuzzy set	Bao Qing Hu	2016	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2015.09.026	partially ordered set;rough set;membership function;defuzzification;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;computer science;fuzzy number;machine learning;data mining;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations	DB	-2.5403782895185296	-22.07231239916749	183805

3c75ecb96ff4aea3cb8e04ed61cd4553c5b2a477	probabilistic quadratic programming problems with some fuzzy parameters		We present a solution procedure for a quadratic programming problem with some probabilistic constraints where the model parameters are either triangular fuzzy number or trapezoidal fuzzy number. Randomness and fuzziness are present in some real-life situations, so it makes perfect sense to address decision making problem by using some specified random variables and fuzzy numbers. In the present paper, randomness is characterized by Weibull random variables and fuzziness is characterized by triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy number. A defuzzification method has been introduced for finding the crisp values of the fuzzy numbers using the proportional probability density function associatedwith themembership functions of these fuzzy numbers. An equivalent deterministic crisp model has been established in order to solve the proposed model. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the solution procedure.	defuzzification;fuzzy number;numerical analysis;quadratic programming;randomness;real life	Suresh K. Barik;M. P.

In this Paper, we consider a solution of Rectangular Fuzzy game with pay-off as imprecise numbers instead of crisp numbers viz., interval and LR-type Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers. The solution of such Fuzzy games with pure strategies by minimax-maximin principle is discussed. The Algebraic Method to solve 2 2 Fuzzy games without saddle point by using mixed strategies is also illustrated. Here, n m pay-off matrix is reduced to 2 2 pay-off matrix by Dominance Method. This fact is illustrated by means of Numerical Example.

Different from most of current methods, the DS–AHP method solves a problem directly based on its incomplete decision matrix. On the base of Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, our approach first identifies all possible focal elements from the incomplete decision matrix, and then it calculates the basic probability assignment of each focal element and the belief interval of each decision alternative. Preference relations among all decision alternatives are determined by comparing their belief intervals. A numerical example is studied to illustrate the detailed implementation process of the DS–AHP approach and demonstrate its potential applications in MADM problems with incomplete information. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

First, based on the special case with one summand in the ordinal sum of S1, all the sufficient and necessary conditions of solutions to the distributive equation above are given and the characterization of its continuous solutions is derived. It is shown that the distributive equation does not have continuous fuzzy implication solutions. Subsequently, we characterize its non-continuous fuzzy implication solutions. Finally, it is pointed out that the case with finite summands in the ordinal sum of S1 is equivalent to the one with one summand. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

dbc037b71ddd543c18c4f3a657e30ed940307275	madm based on distance and correlation coefficient measures with decision-maker preferences under a hesitant fuzzy environment		In multiple attribute decision making (MADM), hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) are powerful tools for expressing uncertain and vague information. Recently, MADM problems with hesitant fuzzy information have attracted increasing attention, and many MADM methods have been developed. However, only a limited amount of research has considered MADM problems that simultaneously determine attribute weights and decision-maker (DM) preferences. Therefore, we propose an MADM approach for such problems under a hesitant fuzzy environment. First, we derive extended distance and correlation coefficient measures for HFSs that are more reasonable and effective when the DM preferences are considered. We then apply the extended distance measure to subjective and objective preference information to determine attribute weights, and use these to calculate the weighted correlation coefficient between the ideal choice and each alternative. Further, we determine the ranking order of all alternatives, from which it is easy to identify the best choice. Finally, we present an example that demonstrates the practicality of the proposed approach. Communicated by V. Loia.

IT2 FS has been widely used in many applications, where the comparison between IT2 FSs plays a significant role. A new comparison method based on a fuzzy preference relation with the probability degrees between two IT2 FSs is proposed in this paper. Comparing with the current two methods, the proposed method overcomes the conflicts between comparison results and human intuitive, preserves the consistency of ranking, and it makes the comparison results more precisely by attaching the probability degrees with the comparison results. The numerical example showed its validity.	fuzzy set;numerical analysis	Feng Zhang;Joshua Ignatius;Chee-Peng Lim	2011	2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016741	fuzzy logic;discrete mathematics;membership function;defuzzification;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;machine learning;fuzzy measure theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;algorithm	Robotics	-2.790852071375923	-20.935766608315422	187578

However, since fuzzy problems are generally represented by sets, not crisp numbers, various aggregation schemes are needed to manipulate and to combine the different elements in a fuzzy optimization problem. Based on these different aggregations, various concavity properties can be formulated and explored. In this paper, the intersection aggregation and the convex combination aggregation are explored based on the supp-Φ1-concave fuzzy sets. First, the concept of Φ1-convexity, which covers a wider class of sets and functions, is extended to fuzzy sets. Supp-Φ1-concave and supp-Φ1-quasiconcave fuzzy sets are then introduced; and some useful aggregation and composition rules are developed. Based on these aggregation and composition rules and the generalized concave properties, fuzzy multiple objective decision making problems are formulated and the conditions to ensure local–global maximum property are discussed. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We assume the standard formulation of the centroid based on the sup-min extension principle. The centroid of a triangular type-2 fuzzy set can be considered as a subsequent analytical extension of the KM type-reduction procedure dedicated to interval type-2 sets.

9db2e595d287f4c1ad6a930fae5aedc308909e2c	polyhedral representation of fuzzy linear bases	linear interpolation	In [15], we introduced the concepts of fuzzy bases, fuzzy linear interpolation and fuzzy polygon of four-component fuzzy linear bases. In [16], these concepts were used in the maximal profile of the set of polygons generated from a set of break points for each variable dimension. Theconcept was operationalized in a fuzzy linear basis algorithm (FLBA) for nonlinear separable programming problems involving no more than a finite number of discontinuities. The FLBA provides a powerful platform forparallel processing of the fuzzy linear sub-problems included in the finite FLB-chain. In this paper we extend the theory of fuzzy linear bases from the set of polygons toapolyhedral representation of four-component fuzzy linear bases defined on a closed subset of the real line.	polyhedral	Pei-Zhuang Wang;Ralf Östermark;Rajan Alex;Shaohua Tan	2001	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s005000100083	fuzzy logic;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;membership function;defuzzification;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;computer science;fuzzy subalgebra;fuzzy number;fuzzy measure theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy associative matrix;linear interpolation;fuzzy set operations	NLP	-0.6264887818735024	-23.903430419795953	188717

We first introduce some approaches to obtaining the weight information of attributes, and then establish an optimization model based on the positive ideal point of attribute values, by which the attribute weights can be determined. For the special situations where the information about attribute weights is completely unknown, we establish another optimization model. By solving this model, we get a simple and exact formula, which can be used to determine the attribute weights. We compute the correlation coefficient between each alternative and positive ideal alternative, and then rank the alternatives by means of the correlation coefficient between each alternative and positive ideal alternative. Finally, we shall present a numerical example to show the pattern recognition problems about the classification of metal materials with dual hesitant fuzzy information in order to illustrate the method proposed in this paper.	coefficient	Yuanfang Chen;Xiaodong Peng;Guohua Guan;Huade Jiang	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-130926	variable and attribute;attribute domain;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;mathematics	AI	-2.5732598359191883	-20.014310097106932	188935

Firstly, the concept of an interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic set and an interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic variable (INULV) is presented by combining an uncertain linguistic variable with an interval neutrosophic set. Secondly, we introduce the operation rules of INULVs and the score function, accuracy function and certainty function of an INULV. Thirdly, we develop an interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic weighted arithmetic averaging (INULWAA) operator and an interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic weighted geometric averaging (INULWGA) operator and investigate their properties. Fourthly, a group decision-making method is established based on the INULWAA and INULWGA operators to solve multiple attribute group decision-making problems with interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic information. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the application of the developed approach.	indeterminacy in concurrent computation;interval arithmetic	Jun Ye	2017	Int. J.

We explore algebraic structures where these operators behave differently, masses being linguistic labels, or focal elements being more, or less, than an union of singletons of a discernment space. In some cases, we have to forget this space and the notion of singleton to place ourselves in the space of possible focal elements. We propose three new structures for linguistic labels, replacing masses. We show how to adapt the theory of evidence to six constrained spaces for the focal elements expressed by the experts.	focal (programming language);fuzzy set;linear algebra;theory	Christophe Osswald;Arnaud Martin	2008	2008 11th International Conference on Information Fusion		discrete mathematics;mathematics;algebra	DB	2.3969741901292685	-21.225650535065373	189503
8b6ad4b25793f2dbe3ef4a1a4e76cb8c1182673e	on appropriate selection of fuzzy aggregation operators in medical decision support system		The Decision Support System (DSS) contains more than one antecedent and the degrees of strength of the antecedents need to be combined to determine the overall strength of the rule consequent. The membership values of the linguistic variables in Fuzzy have to be combined using an aggregation operator. But it is not feasible to predefine the form of aggregation operators in decision-making. Instead, each rule should be found based on the feeling of the experts and on their actual decision pattern over the set of typical examples. Thus this work illustrates how the choice of aggregation operators is intended to mimic human decision making and can be selected and adjusted to fit empirical data – a series of test cases. Both parametrized and non-parametrized aggregation operators are adapted to fit empirical data. Moreover, they provided compensatory properties and, therefore, seemed to produce a better decision support system. To solve the problem, a threshold point from the output of the aggregation operators is chosen as the separation point between two classes. The bestachieved accuracy is chosen as the appropriate aggregation operator. Thus a medical decision can be generated, which is very close to a practitioner’s guideline.	decision support system	K. M.

The knowledge base is fuzzified to allow the experts to express their expertise (premises and rules) attached with grades of importance in the unit interval. Arguments are attached with a score aggregating the importance expressed on their premises and rules. Extensions are then computed and the strength of each of which can also be obtained based on its strong arguments. The strengths are used to rank fuzzy extensions from the strongest to the weakest one, upon which decisions can be made. The approach is finally used for decision making in a real world application within the EcoBioCap project.	argumentation framework;computation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;knowledge base;quantifier (logic);set theory;t-norm	Nouredine Tamani;Madalina Croitoru	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08795-5_9	artificial intelligence;data mining;mathematics;algorithm	AI	-3.132190538795663	-22.136193068957702	190784

But the collected or available data available from the historical records are mostly uncertain, limited and imprecise in nature. Thus in such situation(s), it is difficult, if not impossible, to analyze the behavior and performance of the system up to desired degree of accuracy. Thus attempt has been made by the author for analyzing the behavior and performance of the system using Vague Lambda–Tau methodology. Intuitionistic fuzzy set theory has been used for representing the classical(crisp) data into triangular fuzzy numbers because intuitionistic sets are characterized by a truth membership function and false membership functions (non-membership functions) so that sum of both values is less than 1. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed and the effects on system mean time between failures are addressed. The performance analysis of the system has been investigated through a composite measure of reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) called RAM-Index which explore the effect of failure/repair rates on system performance. Based on their performance, the most critical component of the system has been investigated. The methodology improves the shortcomings of the existing probabilistic approaches and gives a better understanding of the system behavior through its graphical representation. The pulping unit of a paper mill situated in a northern part of India, producing approximately 200 ton of paper per day, has been considered to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results obtained by proposed approach are compared with the existing fuzzy Lambda–Tau and the crisp methodologies. 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 . Introduction It is well known that the conventional reliability analysis using robabilities has been found to be inadequate to handle uncertainty f failure data and modeling. This is mainly due to the fact that hey required the large amount of data for analysis, which are difcult to obtain from various resources. If somehow they can be ollected then they have a high sort of uncertainty and hence if the ata are used as such in the calculations then the results may be ighly uncertain. Thus, the probabilistic approach to the convenional reliability analysis is inadequate to account for such built-in ncertainties in the data. This problem was overcome by using the Please cite this article in press as: H. Garg, Performance and behavior a methodology, Appl. Soft Comput. J.

Singer [3] presented fuzzy set theoretic approach to fault tree analysis. Chen [4] used the arithmetic of fuzzy numbers to evaluate system reliability. The concept of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy arithmetic has been used in the evaluation of the reliability of the system by the various researchers [5–8,4,9,10]. The applications of handling the uncertainties using linguistic preferences in supply chain management are addressed by the authors given in Tseng [11], Tseng and Chiu [12], Tseng et al.[13] In fuzzy set theory, the degree of belonging of element to the set is represented by a membership value in the real interval [0, 1] and there exists degree of non-membership which is complementary in nature. From latter point of view, it is true and acceptable that grade of membership and non-membership are complementary.

In the proposed method, it is assumed that the decision maker has fuzzy goals for not only permissible objective levels but also the corresponding distribution functions. Such fuzzy goals are quantified by eliciting the corresponding membership functions. Using the fuzzy decision, such two kinds of membership functions are integrated, and Dp-Pareto optimal solution concept is defined in the integrated membership space. By using the bisection method and the convex programming technique, the satisfactory solution is obtained from among a Dp-Pareto optimal solution set through the interaction with the decision maker.	bisection method;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;linear programming;membership function (mathematics);pareto efficiency	Hitoshi Yano	2012	The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems	10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6504996	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;optimal decision;membership function;defuzzification;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;computer science;fuzzy number;machine learning;linear partial information;goal programming;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations	Robotics	-1.2277815610552152	-18.17639485340182	191037
64d85d2472d161c963c5ee0a8365593b98d01466	precise past - fuzzy future		This paper examines the motivation and foundations of fuzzy sets theory, now some 20 years old, particularly possible misconceptions about possible operators and relations to probability theory. It presents a standard uncertainty logic (SUI.) that subsumes standard propositional, fuzzy and probability logics, and shows how many key results may be derived within SUL without further constraints. These include resolutions of standard paradoxes such as those of the bald man and of the barber, decision rules used in pattern recognition and control, the derivation of numeric truth values from the axiomatic form of the SUL, and the derivation of operators such as the arithmetic mean. The addition of the constraint of truth-functionality to a SUL is shown to give fuzzy, or Lukasiewicz infinitely-valued, logic. The addition of the constraint of the law of the excluded middle to a SUL is shown to give probability, or modal $5, logic. An example is given of the use of the two logics in combination to give a possibility vector when modelling sequential behaviour with uncertain observations.	axiomatic system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;logical connective;modal logic;pattern recognition;structured systems analysis and design method	Brian R.

From the probability viewpoint, the possibility degree of comparison between two interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) is defined by using the notion of 2-dimensional random vector, and a new method is then developed to rank IVIFNs. Hereby the ordered weighted average operator and hybrid weighted average operator for IVIFNs are defined based on the Karnik-Mendel algorithms and employed to solve multi-attribute group decision making problems with IVIFNs. The individual overall attribute values of alternatives are obtained by using the weighted average operator for IVIFNs. By using the hybrid weighted average operator for IVIFNs, we can obtain the collective overall attribute values of alternatives, which are used to rank the alternatives. A numerical example is examined to illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method in this paper.		Shuping Wan;Jiuying Dong	2014	J. Comput. Syst.

Owing to fuzziness being inherent in decision data and group decision making processes, the crisp values are inadequate to model real-life situations. In this paper, the weights of all attributes and the ratings of each alternative with respect to each attribute are described by linguistic terms which can be expressed in trapezoid fuzzy numbers. A fuzzy distance measure is developed to calculate difference between trapezoid fuzzy numbers. The compromise ratio method for FMAGDM is developed by introducing the ranking index based on the concept that the chosen alternative should be as close as possible to the ideal solution and as far away from the negative-ideal solution as possible simultaneously. The computation principle and procedure of the compromise ratio method are described in detail in this paper. Moreover the TOPSIS method which was developed for multi-attribute decision making (MADM) with crisp decision data is analyzed and extended to multiattribute group decision making (MAGDM) under fuzzy environments. A comparative analysis of the compromise ratio method and the extended fuzzy TOPSIS method is illustrated with a numerical example, showing their similarity and some differences. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

They can all be used following the principles of multiattribute value theory. Furthermore, SMART, swing, and AHP ask the decision makers to give directly the numerical estimates of weight ratios although the elicitation questions are dierent. In earlier studies these methods have yielded dierent weights. Our results suggest that the resulting weights are dierent because the methods explicitly or implicitly lead the decision makers to choose their responses from a limited set of numbers. The other consequences from this are that the spread of weights and the inconsistency between the preference statements depend on the number of attributes that a decision maker considers simultaneously.

c8b7c6ba36a120e131c83ebc5bde7c5b63f0525d	some q-rung orthopai fuzzy bonferroni mean operators and their application to multi-attribute group decision making		In the real multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM), there will be a mutual relationship between different attributes. As we all know, the Bonferroni mean (BM) operator has the advantage of considering interrelationships between parameters. In addition, in describing uncertain information, the eminent characteristic of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFs) is that the sum of the qth power of the membership degree and the qth power of the degrees of non-membership is equal to or less than 1, so the space of uncertain information they can describe is broader. In this paper, we combine the BM operator with q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs) to propose the q-rung orthopair fuzzy BM (q-ROFBM) operator, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted BM (q-ROFWBM) operator, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy geometric BM (q-ROFGBM) operator, and the q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted geometric BM (q-ROFWGBM) operator, then the MAGDM methods are developed based on these operators. Finally, we use an example to illustrate the MAGDM process of the proposed methods. The proposed methods based on q-ROFWBM and q-ROFWGBM operators are very useful to deal with MAGDM problems.

Second, a hybrid decision table consisted both of the “order information” and “loss function”, is utilized to solve the ordered three-way decisions with two classification problem. Two order sets (dominating set and dominated set generated by order relation) and three risk strategies (optimistic strategy, equable strategy, pessimistic strategy) are induced to construct the model and design the algorithm of ordered three-way decisions.

However, little attention has been given to the linguistic interpretation of these models. The use of relational models is recommended since their development follows a natural sequence based on the original ideas about fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, involving the estimation of the relations existing between linguistic terms which have previously been defined by the user. In the present paper the problem of extracting linguistic knowledge from systems by using relational models is addressed. A new algorithm for the identification of these models which can provide analytical or numerical solutions depending on user requirements is also proposed. Examples are presented showing that both quantitative and qualitative modeling can be effectively achieved by combining the proposed methodologies for identification and extraction of linguistic knowledge from systems.	algorithm;complex systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;fuzzy set;numerical analysis;online and offline;recursion;relational model;requirement;user requirements document	Ricardo J.

This is intended to allay many of the operational difficulties involved in assessing and using multiattribute utility functions. The system admits imprecise assignments for weights and utilities and uncertainty in the multiattribute strategies, which can be defined in terms of ranges for each attribute instead of single values. Inputs can be subjected to different sensitivity analyses, permitting users to test the robustness of the ranking of the strategies and gain insight into and confidence about the final solution. An application of the system to the restoration of a contaminated lake is illustrated throughout the paper. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Next, we proposed some aggregation operators including ordered intuitionistic normal ordered fuzzy weighted averaging operator, intuitionistic normal fuzzy ordered weighted geometric averaging operator, intuitionistic normal fuzzy related ordered weighted averaging operator, intuitionistic normal fuzzy related ordered weighted geometric averaging operator, induced intuitionistic normal fuzzy related ordered weighted averaging operator and induced intuitionistic normal fuzzy related ordered weighted geometric averaging operator. After that, similarity measure between two intuitionistic normal fuzzy numbers is defined. For multi-criteria decision making problems, in which the criteria are interactive and the criteria values are intuitionistic normal fuzzy numbers, an approach based on induced intuitionistic normal fuzzy related aggregation operators is proposed. And the comprehensive evaluation values of all alternatives can be derived by applying induced intuitionistic normal fuzzy related aggregation operators. Finally, the ranking of the whole alternatives set can be obtained by comparing the relative closeness of alternatives to the ideal solution. In the end, an example is given to show the validity and the feasibility of the method.

a60e8ab3b43270152edb2194e6e54ae28edf8ff3	interval-valued fuzzy strong s-subsethood measures, interval-entropy and p-interval-entropy		In this paper, we introduce the concept of fuzzy interval-entropy. The main feature of this new entropy is that the provided value is a closed subinterval of [0, 1]. This fact has led us to define interval-valued fuzzy strong S-subsethood measures which we use to build fuzzy interval-entropies. As we require that the results of both measures are intervals, we should work with total orders to be able to compare the results. The problem of finding equilibrium points for interval-valued negations with respect to total orders has led us to introduce and study the concept of P-interval-entropy. Finally, in an illustrative example, we discuss an application of the different concepts we have considered. We also compare our results to those obtained in our application where we use the classical interval-valued entropy, which provides a real number instead of an interval as its result, as we know. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Within this framework,we propose new multicriteria classification procedures based on non-totally compensatorymeasures of preference and similarity. We assume that the categories are given a priori andare characterised by fictitious alternatives serving as reference points, each representing atypical element of a category, or each representing a boundary between two categories.Several assignment methods are presented, all based on a filtering process exploiting binaryrelations constructed following the concordance and non-discordance principles. We firstconsider the case of ordered categories and a filtering procedure exploiting valued preferencerelations is proposed for assessing the membership of alternatives in categories. Then weconsider the case of non-ordered categories and filtering methods exploiting valued in-difference relations are introduced. Finally, a small example is given.

In particular, novel fuzzy metrics, by means of fuzzy and classical metrics and certain special types of functions, are introduced. We also give an extension theorem for two fuzzy metrics that agree in its nonempty intersection. Finally, we give an application of this type of fuzzy metrics to color image processing. We propose a fuzzy metric that simultaneously takes into account two different distance criteria between color image pixels and we use this fuzzy metric to filter noisy images, obtaining promising results. This application is also illustrative of how fuzzy metrics can be used in other engineering problems.	fuzzy logic	Valentín Gregori;Samuel Morillas;Almanzor Sapena	2011	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/j.fss.2010.10.019	fuzzy logic;computer vision;discrete mathematics;color image;membership function;defuzzification;information processing;image processing;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;computer science;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;noise reduction;fuzzy measure theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;equivalence of metrics;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	EDA	0.793115031047383	-22.736240811348807	194322

e2ed57aa11ac380cae19408f2715ec57fa3db20a	multicost decision-theoretic rough sets based on maximal consistent blocks		Decision-theoretic rough set comes from Bayesian decision procedure, in which a pair of the thresholds is derived by the cost ma- trix for the construction of probabilistic rough set. However, classical decision-theoretic rough set can only be used to deal with complete in- formation systems. Moreover, it does not take the property of variation of cost into consideration. To solve above two problems, the maximal consistent block is introduced into the construction of decision-theoretic rough set by using multiple cost matrixes. Our approach includes op- timistic and pessimistic multicost decision-theoretic rough set models. Furthermore, the whole decision costs of optimistic and pessimistic mul- ticost decision-theoretic rough sets are calculated in decision systems. This study suggests potential application areas and new research trends concerning decision-theoretic rough set.	maximal set;rough set	Xingbin Ma;Xibei Yang;Yong Qi;Xiaoning Song;Jingyu Yang	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11740-9_75	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;rough set;data mining;mathematics;dominance-based rough set approach	EDA	0.5545640084164121	-19.336747114604826	194786

In this study, we employ interval-valued rough random variables (IRRVs) and interval-valued rough numbers (IRNs) to process decision information. Additionally, we propose a more reasonable comparison method of IRNs. We combine and extend the stochastic dominance of IRRVs and the classic ELECTRE III method (a useful outranking method). Finally, we develop an extended ELECTRE III approach for rough stochastic multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. We provide examples concerning site selection and investment appraisal in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach. We verify the applicability and advantages of our approach through comparative analyses with other existing methods. Illustrative and comparative analyses indicate that our proposed approach is feasible for many practical MCDM problems, and the final ranking results of the proposed approach are more accurate and consistent with those obtained in actual decision-making processes. The IRNs and IRRVs are useful for dealing with rough stochastic decision information. The proposed approach is feasible and effective for solving rough stochastic MCDM problems, and retains the merits of IRRVs, SD relations, and outranking methods. The final outcomes from our approach are convincing and consist with actual decision-making. Thus, our proposed approach is more widely applicable.	approximation algorithm;artificial intelligence;concordance (publishing);distortion;genetic programming;purchasing;randomness;rough set;selection algorithm	Jian-qiang Wang;Jin-jue Kuang;Jing Ni Wang;Hong-yu Zhang	2016	Cognitive Computation	10.1007/s12559-016-9417-5	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence	AI	-3.8674588521754565	-18.419919826379974	195214
a3a8f2c749ca930a62166e8be1c6bbe87d5eb37e	using multiple reference levels in multi-criteria decision aid: the generalized-additive independence model and the choquet integral approaches		Abstract In many Multi-Criteria Decision problems, one can construct with the decision maker several reference levels on the attributes such that some decision strategies are conditional on the comparison with these reference levels. The classical models (such as the Choquet integral) cannot represent these preferences. We are then interested in two models. The first one is the Choquet with respect to a p -ary capacity combined with utility functions, where the p -ary capacity is obtained from the reference levels. The second one is a specialization of the Generalized-Additive Independence (GAI) model, which is discretized to fit with the presence of reference levels. These two models share common properties (monotonicity, continuity, properly weighted, … ), but differ on the interpolation means (Lovasz extension for the Choquet integral, and multi-linear extension for the GAI model). A drawback of the use of the Choquet integral with respect to a p -ary capacity is that it cannot satisfy decision strategies in each domain bounded by two successive reference levels that are completely independent of one another. We show that this is not the case with the GAI model.

We consider two types of RUs: S-shaped, representing decision makers who are risk-seeking for relative losses, and non-S-shaped, representing those that are risk-averse for relative losses. Based on these RUs, we establish two new classes of reference-dependent aggregation operators; we study their properties and show that their generality covers a number of existing aggregation operators. To determine the optimal weights for these aggregation operators, we construct an attribute deviation weight model and a decision maker (DM) deviation weight model. Furthermore, we develop a new multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) approach based on these RU aggregation operators and weight models. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the application of the approach.	decision analysis;decision theory;numerical analysis;risk aversion	Jianwei Gao;Huihui Liu	2017	Symmetry	10.3390/sym9030043	discrete mathematics;group decision-making;decision analysis;artificial intelligence;mathematics;utility;algorithm	AI	-2.603949683862811	-18.63019760807708	196116

This paper utilizes linguistic values to evaluate the performance of qualitative criteria and proposes using appropriate shapes of fuzzy numbers to evaluate the performance of quantitative criteria for each problem with respect to its particular conditions. In addition, a process to determine the weights of criteria using fuzzy numbers, which considers their competition to gain greater weights and their influence on each other is described. A new fuzzy methodology is proposed to solve such a problem that utilizes parametric form of fuzzy numbers. The case study of diversion of water into Lake Urmia watershed, which is defined using triangular, trapezoidal, and bell-shape fuzzy numbers demonstrates the utility of the proposed method.

For this reason, we study OWA operators defined on an arbitrary finite lattice endowed with a t-norm and a t-conorm. In the case of RGB color images, we apply OWA operators defined on a finite product lattice. Depending on the OWA operator considered, we see that the reduced images become brighter or darker. Then, we make a preliminary study of a qualitative orness measure for classifying each lattice OWA operator according to its proximity to the maximum of the given data.	algorithm;channel (digital image);color image;image processing;t-norm	Gustavo Ochoa;Inmaculada Lizasoain;Daniel Paternain;Humberto Bustince;Nikhil R.

We are often required to deal with uncertainty, subjectiveness and imprecise data, which are represented by fuzzy data. In this paper, we consider the ideal solution and the anti-ideal solution and assess each alternative in terms of distance as well as similarity to the ideal solution and the anti-ideal solution. To minimize the error, the normalization of fuzzy data is carefully avoided. To get greater accuracy in ranking fuzzy rating, we use the latest and advanced similarity measure. Distance and similarity measures for fuzzy numbers are used and aggregation is guided by the decision rules in order to construct decision function. Further, OWA operators with maximal entropy are used to aggregate across all criteria and the overall score of each alternative is determined The proposed method is more flexible in modeling the decision maker's preferences and more appropriate and effective to handle multicriteria problems of considerable complexity.	fuzzy set;set theory	P.

In order to provide these soft algebraic structures, we introduce the concepts of soft union hemirings (soft union h-ideals) of hemirings by soft intersection-union product and obtain some related results. Finally, we investigate some characterizations of h-hemiregular hemirings by soft union h-ideals.	superuser	Jianming Zhan;Naim Çagman;Aslihan Sezgin Sezer	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-130822	combinatorics;mathematics;algorithm	NLP	-1.3445686224951516	-23.793610922181287	198716

This paper aims to contribute to analogous treatment of information connected with messages from other uncertain sources, influenced by not only random but also some other types of uncertainty, namely with imprecision and vagueness. The main sections are devoted to the characterization and quantitative representation of such uncertainties and measures of information produced by sources of the considered type.	vagueness	Milan Mares	2011	Kybernetika		uncertainty analysis;artificial intelligence;signal processing;mathematics;symbol;algorithm;statistics	Theory	1.9466384801912955	-19.52006418436164	199096

The analysis of decision-making problems on incomplete soft set data is usually performed by first estimating incomplete values. In this paper, we analyze the decision-making problems of incomplete soft sets with incomplete data without turning them into complete data. We define a soft incomplete discernibility matrix and a soft parameter dominant incomplete discernibility matrix to solve the application of incomplete soft sets in decision-making problems. We focus on the classification ability of the corresponding parameter for a given incomplete soft set. The novel method maintains the original data state and successfully constructs a decision-making approach that can be applied to incomplete soft sets. Finally, the weighted soft incomplete discernibility matrix is defined for application in weighted parameter decision-making issues.

Then, motivated by the ideal of traditional arithmetic operation, we have developed some aggregation operators for aggregating interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic information: interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted average (IVDHFLWA) operator, interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average (IVDHFLOWA) operator and Interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic hybrid average (IVDHFLHA) operator. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic multiple attribute decision making problems.	fuzzy set	Gui-Wu Wei;Xin-Rui Xu;De-Xue Deng	2016	KES Journal	10.3233/KES-160337	machine learning;data mining	AI	-2.4013408349518772	-21.477492564315416	199500
