In this paper, the problem of clustering different length input data is considered. The edit distance as the minimum number of elementary edit operations needed to transform one vector into another is used. A heuristic for clustering unequal length vectors, analogue to the well known k-means algorithm is described and analyzed. This heuristic determines cluster centroids expanding shorter vectors to the lengths of the longest ones in each cluster in a specific way. It is shown that the time and space complexities of the heuristic are linear in the number of input vectors. Experimental results on real data originating from a system for classification of Web attacks are given.	algorithm;cluster analysis;correctness (computer science);dspace;edit distance;heuristic;iteration;k-means clustering;whole earth 'lectronic link	Slobodan Petrovic;Gonzalo √Ålvarez	2003	CoRR		edit distance;k-medians clustering;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;cluster analysis;dspace;string-to-string correction problem;k-means clustering;clustering high-dimensional data	ML	-1.4181501749503973	-38.716777133609675	199915
