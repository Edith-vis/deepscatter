If this retailer derives profits from extended warranty sales, the manufacturers face a dilemma in setting their base warranties. Although they have incentive to increase their warranties to make their products attractive to consumers, the retailer might prefer selling lower-warranty products to enhance extended warranties sales. We develop a stylized model to determine and analyze optimal manufacturer and retailer strategies in this setting. Consistent with the ongoing decline in warranties for products that are sold through independent retailers, we show that these interactions exert downward pressure on manufacturer warranties. Rather than pitching the extended warranty at the checkout after customers have selected a certain product, we find that retailers can often benefit from inducing simultaneous consideration of product and extended warranty characteristics, for example by posting extended warranty information right on the product shelf.

Sometimes join products are produced together as a result of the technology adopted in a particular production process, as with electricity and water for irrigation from a hydroelectric dam. The essential characteristic of all the preceding examples is that neither product of each pair could be produced independently of the other once the technological setup has been decided.  Often the relative proportions of joint products emerging from a production process can be varied to some extent by changing the quality of input materials or the extent of processing. Such products are said to be joint products in variable property  The accumulation of cost data in joint product situations can provide useful information for analysis of overall cost and revenue changes arising from variations in input quality and processing effort.	credit card fraud;focal (programming language);inventory;linear programming;simulation;tree accumulation	Morcos F.

2115e155518c8c8ded2432b0e7fed75a70c53495	brandaid: a marketing-mix model, part 1: structure	marketing mix	Marketing managers make decisions about price, advertising, promotion, and other marketing variables on the basis of factual data, judgments, and assumptions about how the market works. BRANDAID is a flexible, on-line model for assembling these elements to describe the market and evaluate strategies. This paper motivates the model and presents its mathematics. The structure is modular so that individual decision areas can be added or deleted at will. The model is of the aggregate response type, in which decision variables relate closely to specific sales performance measures. The major submodels are advertising, promotion, price, salesmen, and retail distribution. The advertising submodel employs a long-run sales response to advertising function and a linear lag process. Promotional effects are built up from a characteristic time pattern for the type of promotion and a response curve. Salesman affect sales through a response process structurally similar to that for advertising. Retail distribution variables are intermediaries that the company affects and that in turn affect customer response. Submodel outputs combine multiplicatively. Competition enters in a modular, symmetric way through a matrix of competitive coefficients that determine the source of sales for each brand as it seeks to increase its market position.		John D. C.

This form of decentralized product distribution demonstrates several unique features. Only a small fraction of users in the network are queried when a potential adopter seeks a file and many of these users may even free-ride i.e. not distribute the content to others. As a result, generated demand may not always be fulfilled immediately. We present mixing models for product diffusion in P2P networks that capture decentralized product distribution by current adopters, incomplete demand fulfillment and other unique aspects of P2P product diffusion. The models serve to demonstrate the important role that P2P search process and distribution referrals – payments made to users that distribute files – play in efficient P2P media distribution. We demonstrate the ability of our diffusion models to derive normative insights for P2P media distributors by studying the effectiveness of distribution referrals in speeding product diffusion and determining optimal referral policies for fully decentralized and hierarchical P2P networks.	peer-to-peer file sharing	Kartik Hosanagar;Peng Han;Yong Tan	2010	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.1080.0221	simulation;economics;computer science;marketing;operations management;peer-to-peer;diffusion;microeconomics;free riding	Metrics	-3.4757840206257047	-6.274827118409043	150663

The process of counter-WMD terrorism often involves multiple government and terrorist group players, which is under-studied in the literature. In this paper, first we consider two subgames: a proliferation game between two terrorist groups or cells (where one handling the black market for profits proliferates to the other one to attack, and this is modelled as a terrorism supply chain) and a subsidization game between two governments (where one potential WMD victim government subsidizes the other host government, who can interfere with terrorist activities). Then we integrate these two subgames to study how the victim government can use the strategy of subsidization to induce the host government to disrupt the terrorism supply chain. To our knowledge, this is the first game-theoretic study for modelling and optimally disrupting a terrorism supply chain in a complex four-player scenario. We find that in the integrated game, when proliferation payment is high or low, the practical terrorist group will proliferate and not proliferate, respectively, regardless of government decisions. In contrast, in the subsidization subgame between the two governments, the decision of subsidization depends on its cost. When proliferation payment is medium, the decision of subsidization depends on not only its cost but also the preparation cost and the attacking cost. Findings from our results would assist in government policymaking.

This paper considers an approach of revenue sharing for the whole members in the closed-loop supply chain. First, the coalition value which is created in the paper is a new cooperative game theoretic approach for revenue sharing. The approach is based on the weight value system and coalitions, and is applicable not only to the revenue sharing in the closed-loop supply chain, but also to almost all kinds of the revenue sharing. After that, an example of closed-loop supply chain is illustrated to explain the application of the coalition value.	game theory;revenue sharing;value (ethics)	Weimin Ma;Zhang Zhao	2010	2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580924	game theory;revenue model;service management;supply chain	Robotics	-2.8166658925999637	-5.11995946170989	152046

When the demand process is a general jump-diffusion process, we provide a general formula for the equilibrium if it exists. When the demand rate is an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (O–U) process, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium and find an explicit expression for the equilibrium. Computational results show that the return policy has significant impact on the Stackelberg equilibrium.	computation;nash equilibrium;newsvendor model;severo ornstein	Weiwei Zhang;Zhongfei Li;Ke Fu;Fan Wang	2017	APJOR	10.1142/S0217595917500312	uniqueness;extended newsvendor model;stackelberg competition;profit (economics);newsvendor model;microeconomics;economics	AI	-0.3447432205988385	-4.203499204063708	152235
4d9290d0becaeec429b6253293d350566dc9585c	value of on-site rework in a coordinated two-stage supply chain with supply imperfection		This paper considers a decentralized supply chain with one supplier with supply imperfection and one manufacturer. The supplier performs outbound inspection to ensure that its components comply with the quality specification (QS), and makes efforts to improve inspection reliability. Once receiving the supplier’s components, the manufacturer begins the assembly production process, requiring that every component meet the quality requirement (QR). The components that do not meet the QS or QR are reworked by the supplier. The location at which the latter group of the components is reworked becomes a strategic choice, provided that the option of on-site rework, i.e. rework performed at the manufacturer’s production site, is available. We show that on-site rework may be beneficial to the supply chain even if it is more costly than in-house rework, i.e. rework performed in the supplier’s in-house repair center. In addition, coordinating the decentralized supply chain with the option of on-site rework yields maximum supply chain performance over a certain cost range of on-site rework. Finally, we show the similarities and differences of the effects of QS and QR on the coordinated results.	rework (electronics)	Chung-Chi Hsieh;Chih-Chung Chiu	2018	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2018.03.044	operations management;engineering;scheduling (production processes);rework;supply chain;strategic choice	Robotics	0.981396430180486	-6.468456319609918	152744

We show that in industries with generally low-profit prospects, a downward-biased accounting system performs better than a neutral accounting system, and a more downward bias helps mitigate both investment and financing inefficiency; whereas for industries with generally high-profit prospects, an upward-biased accounting system is better than a neutral accounting system, and a more upward bias helps improve financing efficiency. In addition, we find that a more downward-biased accounting system motivates good firms to exert more effort to improve the information quality, which improves overall efficiency.#R##N##R##N#This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting.	information quality	Lin Nan;Xiaoyan Wen	2014	Management Science	10.1287/mnsc.2013.1864	accounting;capital structure;national accounts;actuarial science;economics;throughput accounting;decision analysis;cost–benefit analysis;finance;conservatism;microeconomics;information quality;accounting information system;management;statistics;cost accounting	DB	-1.921356364921956	-8.425907159004378	152979

We consider the product with maximum fixed-life time deterioration as loss of utility is the real scenario of products like fruits, vegetables, juices, etc. Here, time dependent quadratic demand is discussed which is suitable for the products whose demand increases primarily and afterward it starts to decrease. First, we discuss the centralised inventory system in which supplier and retailers willingly take joint decision. Next we address the model with decentralised policy in which supplier and both retailers take individual decisions. The objective is to minimise the total cost in centralised and decentralised policy with respect to cycle times of supplier and two retailers. The model is supported with numerical examples. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to derive insights for decision-maker.		Nita H. Shah;Mrudul Y.

The analysis takes on a game theoretic approach in understanding the impact of a video game’s total advertising budget and the co-op advertising sharing policy on each player’s preferred strategy and corresponding payoffs. Non-cooperative schemes have been demonstrated in which Stackelberg and Nash equilibriums were identified. These were compared with a cooperative Pareto efficient scheme to understand under which conditions both players would be willing to cooperate. Results show that a non-cooperative simultaneous-move game is never preferred by either player, and there exists at least one Pareto efficient solution where both players are better off than at the Stackelberg equilibrium. However, in order to reach this solution, both parties should be willing to negotiate over the co-op advertising sharing policy.	game theory;software publisher	Gözem Güçeri-Ucar;Stefan Koch	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30746-1_13	non-cooperative game;video game design;game design;game theory;simulation;economics;extensive-form game;simultaneous game;marketing;game mechanics;repeated game;game developer;strategy;screening game;advertising;normal-form game;simulations and games in economics education;game design document;sequential game;game testing	ECom	-2.091162705754475	-5.437629635242562	153729

For this purpose, the paper develops a differential game model involving operations and marketing activities that are performed by a manufacturer and a retailer in a simple two-member supply chain. We consider a particular single brand of the manufacturer. The manufacturer decides on production volume, production process improvement and national advertising efforts, while the retailer decides her purchase volume by the manufacturer and her pricing policy toward the final consumers. A revenue sharing contract is employed in the non-cooperative setting. Among the issues addressed on the manufacturer side are the trade-off between production and process improvement activities, the path of inventory over time, and the trade-off between attracting new customers and improving the loyalty of current customers. For the retailer we study the inventory and price evolution over time.

The price of the contingent claim is priced in equilibrium by optimal strategies of representative agent andmarket clearing condition.The risk preferences are of exponential type with a stochastic coefficient of risk aversion.

This paper investigates strategies for load serving entities to hedge against such price risks. Specifically, we compute profit-maximizing portfolios of forward contract and call options as a function of uncertain aggregate user demand and wholesale electricity prices. We compare the profit to the case of Demand Response, where users are offered monetary incentives to temporarily reduce their consumption during periods of supply shortages. Using smart meter data of residential customers in California, we simulate optimal portfolios and derive conditions under which Demand Response outperforms call options and forward contracts. Our analysis suggests that Demand Response becomes more competitive as wholesale electricity prices increase.	aggregate data;cvar;entity;entropy maximization;expected shortfall;network congestion;procurement;simulation;smart meter	Datong P.

We develop a two-period model with a single manufacturer and many resellers. At the beginning of the first period resellers order and receive products from the manufacturer, but at the beginning of the second period, they can trade inventories among themselves in the secondary market. We endogenously derive the optimal decisions for the resellers, along with the equilibrium market price of the secondary market. The secondary market creates two interdependent effects--a quantity effect (sales by the manufacturer) and an allocation effect (supply chain performance). The former is indeterminate; i.e., the total sales volume for the manufacturer may increase or decrease, depending on the critical fractile. The latter is always positive; i.e., the secondary market always improves allocative efficiency. The sum of the effects is also unclear--the welfare of the supply chain may or may not increase as a result of the secondary market. Lastly, we study potential strategies for the manufacturer to increase sales in the presence of the secondary market.		Hau L.

According to this model, predatory advertising produces a negative externality: the interference between the advertising campaigns decreases the total demand of the market.	social capital	Luca Grosset;Paolo Roberti;Bruno Viscolani	2011	Oper.

A range of prices would make trade mutually benecial. So, why doesnt B purchase conservation, or the forest, from S? If this were an equilibrium, S would never consume, anticipating a higher price at the next stage. Anticipating this, B prefers to deviate and not pay. The Markovperfect equilibria are in mixed strategies, implying that the good is consumed (or the forest is cut) at a positive rate. If conservation is more valuable, it is less likely to occur. If there are several interested buyers, cutting increases. If S sets the price and players are patient, the forest disappears with probability one. A rental market has similar properties. By comparison, a rental market dominates a sale market if the value of conservation is low, the consumption value high, and if remote protection is costly. Thus, the theory can explain why optimal conservation does not always occur and why conservation abroad is rented, while domestic conservation is bought.

The model covers the heterogeneous conditionally independent portfolio and the factor infectious default portfolio as special cases. The model assumes that the hazard rate processes are driven by external common factors as well as defaults of other names in the portfolio. The total hazard construction method is used to derive the joint distribution of default times. The basket CDS rates can be computed analytically for homogeneous contagion portfolios and recursively for general factor contagion portfolios. We extend the results to include the interacting counterparty risk and the stochastic intensity process. We compare the analytic results with the Monte Carlo results and discuss the numerical stability problem for large portfolios.	counterparty;interaction;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical stability;recursion	Harry Zheng;Lishang Jiang	2009	Finance and Stochastics	10.1007/s00780-009-0091-2	financial economics;actuarial science;conditional independence;economics;credit risk;finance;mathematics;hazard ratio;statistics	ML	1.646595279549565	-9.72323193608003	157138

For warehouses, uncoordinated arrivals of trucks make appropriate staffing difficult and congestions can interfere with other processes at the facility. To mitigate congestions at loading docks, we propose package auctions to allocate time slots to trucks. The contribution of this research is the application of core-selecting package auctions to address the loading dock congestion problem. We propose a bidding language and a core-selecting package auction for this setting based on existing literature. Core-selecting payment rules can avoid drawbacks of the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism with Clarke pivot rule, e.g., low perceived fairness of prices. We evaluate our proposal by means of simulation and assess (i) the potential for waiting time reduction compared to uncoordinated arrivals as well as sharing of historical waiting times, (ii) the empirical complexity of the computational problem for scenarios of varying complexity, and (iii) the relation of VCG and bidder-Pareto-optimal core payments. Our findings provide evidence that loading dock auctions can alleviate congestion substantially and that the core-pricing rule is well-suited to address the price fairness and low seller revenue problems in this setting.	algorithm;blocking (computing);c date and time functions;computation;computational complexity theory;computational problem;dock connector;edmund m. clarke;european conference on information systems;fairness measure;foreach loop;iteration;like button;logistics;network congestion;pareto efficiency;pseudocode;simulation	Paul Karänke;Martin Bichler;Stefan Minner	2015			logistics;economics;marketing;operations management;commerce	AI	-1.0372635900398224	-4.558575982540116	157237

We apply BLPstyle model to understand consumers’ heterogeneous sensitivity to platform endorsement and consumer-generated reputation with endogeneity issue handled nicely. In addition, we investigate “conform or to be cast out” policy, which is applied by the platform to enforce sellers to improve one typical platform endorsement as platform refund insurance. Our results provide measurable evidence for that individuals exhibit consistent sensitivity to consumer-generated reputation, whereas perceive most of platform endorsement differently. With regard to the policy, it shows that though “cast out” reduce variety of sellers and thus decreases platform-wise demand and consumer welfare, the negative effect is offset by improvement of platform refund insurance by conforming sellers. Furthermore, we find that the policy shock would lead sellers’ further quality escalation, which indirectly benefits platform demand and consumer welfare.	endogeneity (econometrics);online service provider;privilege escalation	Jinyang Zheng;Youwei Wang;Yong Tan	2016			marketing;advertising;commerce	Metrics	-2.8291349024033137	-8.41867957175305	157302

We propose a game theoretic model to analyze the equilibrium IT security of the supply chain in the Stackelberg game, where the power structure in the supply chain manifests in a natural leader. Our results indicate that a natural leader-follower framework ensures higher IT security in the chain than the decentralized decision scenario. However, our results also exhibit that the total cost of IT security is disproportionately divided between the firms of the supply chain. In equilibrium, the leader not only commits first, it must also commit at a higher level than the follower. General comparison with the centralized case as well as the sensitivity of IT security investment of the leader/follower firm on key network parameters is also analyzed.	centralized computing;computer security;game theory	Tridib Bandyopadhyay	2011			service management;operations management;business;computer security;commerce	ECom	-3.101430973812179	-6.001358832069271	157385

Sometimes this can make the contract in question counterproductive to the affected parties. Given this, leveled commitment contracts, in which one agent pays the other a fee to be released from their decommitment, are widely used. However, these fees are often seen only as a deterrent of decommitment and the fact that the decommitment also affects the other party and the society in general is usually ignored. This paper investigates an alternative view, coming from law, that sees the decommitment fees as a means of compensating the victim for their loss. Moreover, we show that these compensatory policies can outperform their traditional noncompensatory counterparts in terms of total utility (the sum of all agent's utilities) in situations in which the utility of one of the parties decreases after the contract has been entered into, but before it is due to be performed.	e-commerce;opponent process	Ilja Ponka;Nicholas R.

Here, we investigate one type of digital experience good-music-whose market environment includes the very real presence of online piracy. Although arguments abound for and against online distribution of such digital goods, little research exists in this area. We develop a model of consumer search for such an experience good, and study different emerging market environments for retailers, where consumers can pirate music online. Retailer cost to publishers is modeled using a variety of licensing schemas. Survey results, together with data from online sharing networks, are utilized to validate a key assumption. Finally, computational analysis is used to develop insights that cannot be obtained analytically. Our results indicate that decreasing piracy is not necessarily equivalent to increasing profit, and online selling strategies can provide additional profits for a traditional retailer even in the presence of piracy. We show that leading strategies for business in such goods should include pricing options, provision of efficient search tools, and new licensing structures.		Sudip Bhattacharjee;Ram D.

We first discuss the non-cooperative condition in order to determine the upper and lower bounds of the efficiencies of sub-DMUs in different stages.

In this paper, we incorporate these uncertainties into a single-product, periodic-review, finite-horizon stochastic inventory system by modeling operational costs, discount factors, and demands as stochastic processes that evolve over time. We study three stockout protocols and establish conditions under which s, S inventory policies are optimal when discount factors, operational costs, and demands are stochastic and correlated both to one another and over time. Examples are provided to demonstrate nontrivial optimal policies in the absence of these sufficient conditions.		Lucy Gongtao Chen;Lawrence W. Robinson;Robin Roundy;Rachel Q.

We consider both additive and multiplicative demand forms. This problem is, in general, intractable due to its computational complexity. We develop a simple heuristic that resolves this issue. The heuristic involves a myopic pricing policy that generates each period’s price as a function of the initial inventory level and a base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. In each period, the firm monitors its so-called price-deflated inventory position and places an order to reach a target base-stock level. The price-deflated inventory position weights the on-hand and pipeline inventory according to a factor that reflects the sensitivity of price to the net inventory level. To assess the effectiveness of our heuristic, we construct an upper bound to the exact system. The upper bound is based on an information-relaxation approach and involves a penalty function derived from the proposed heuristic. A numerical study suggests that the heuristic is near-optimal.The heuristic approach can be applied to a wide variety of inventory systems, such as systems with fixed ordering costs or fixed batch sizes. The heuristic enables us to explore the use of price as a lever to balance supply and demand. Our findings indicate that a responsive strategy (that effectively reduces the replenishment lead time) leads to a more stable pricing policy and that the value of dynamic pricing increases with lead time.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;heart rate variability;heuristic;inventory;linear approximation;linear programming relaxation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;penalty method;power supply;price point;state space;utility functions on indivisible goods;weight function	Fernando Bernstein;Yang Li;Kevin Shang	2016	Management Science	10.1287/mnsc.2015.2227	financial economics;pricing;mathematical optimization;inventory theory;economics;marketing;operations management;mathematics;microeconomics;mathematical economics;stochastic;statistics	AI	2.4556150446165783	-3.978262945100837	158073

As a consequence customers should be served not only with the required quantity and due date as usual, but also with the quality, freshness and homogeneity specified in their orders. The order promising process (OPP) is based on the uncommitted availability of homogeneous product quantities in planned lots (ATP) that are uncertain. Therefore, there is a risk of not being reliable in the commitments because of discrepancies between the real and planned homogeneous quantities. Furthermore, due to the shelf-life (SL), serving customers with the freshest product introduce the risk of increasing waste because of the aging process. To efficiently manage these risks, this work proposes a mathematical model for handling the heterogeneous ATP in fruit SCs and a pricing policy based on the product SL in the moment of delivery. In order to illustrate the application of the modelling approach, a short numerical example is introduced. The example evidences a conflictive situation when optimizing the assignation of homogeneous ATP between serving orders with fresh and more valuable product, what could lead to increase the risk of having waste because of expiration, and consequently, more costs and less profit.

The firms face unique investment opportunities that arise in their business operations and can be undertaken at given reservation prices. The cash flows thus generated are not spanned by the securities traded in the financial market, and cannot be valued uniquely. The intermediary purchases claims against these cash flows, pools them together, and sells tranches of primary or secondary securities to the investors. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which projects are undertaken due to the intermediary’s actions, and firms are amenable to the pool proposed by the intermediary, compared to the no-investment option or the option of forming alternative pools. We also determine the structure of the new securities created by the intermediary and identify how it exploits the arbitrage opportunities available in the market. Our results have implications for valuation of real investments, synergies among them, and their financing mechanisms.	cash;purchasing;resource reservation protocol;synergy;value (ethics)	Vishal Gaur;Sridhar Seshadri;Marti G.

We describe a family of statistical models that address these needs by combining characterization of the economic environment with the ability to predict future economic conditions to make tactical (short-term) decisions, such as product pricing, and strategic (long-term) decisions, such as level of finished goods inventories. Our models characterize economic conditions, called economic regimes, in the form of recurrent statistical patterns that have clear qualitative interpretations. We show how these models can be used to predict prices, price trends, and the probability of receiving a customer order at a given price. These “regime” models are developed using statistical analysis of historical data, and are used in real-time to characterize observed market conditions and predict the evolution of market conditions over multiple time scales. We evaluate our models using a testbed derived from the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM), a supply chain environment characterized by competitive procurement and sales markets, and dynamic pricing. We show how regime models can be used to inform both short-term pricing decisions and long-term resource allocation decisions. Results show that our method outperforms more traditional shortand long-term predictive modeling approaches.	intelligent agent;inventory;predictive modelling;procurement;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;statistical model;testbed	Wolfgang Ketter;John Collins;Maria L.

We develop a general model of an e-commerce market that allows us to analyze optimal price structures, both flat and usage-based. Based on the price structure of a major web hosting provider, we consider single-tier and two-tier (burst-rate) pricing, and our result suggests that the more complex two-tier structure may not be worth the marketing effort, as the firm's equilibrium profits will not increase through the use of this structure. An essential feature of our approach is that we model explicitly the spread of price-QoS tradeoffs across the end-user population.	e-commerce;multitier architecture;quality of service;web hosting service	Zhen Liu;Laura Wynter;Cathy H.

Contrary to this assertion, a model is developed, which demonstrates there is significant evidence that informed investors not to manipulate trading prior to a SEO. Furthermore, there is an arguement that informed investors to trade the stock in the same direction indicated by their private information. In addition, the model is consistent with previous empirical evidence. Previous literature heavily relies on the Gerard and Nanda (1993) model. The model allows for more than one informed investors, whereas Gerard and Nanda de facto allows for only one. This model setting is not only more realistic to the real world, but also dramatically reverses its conclusion that there exists manipulative trading. It also indicated that following Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-21 and Rule 105, whose intention is to curb this manipulation, the SEO discount will change in either direction. Thus previous literature delineating methodology of utilizing the SEO discount change to test for the existence of manipulative trading is not well grounded. The model also predicts that undervalued firms tend to disclose more information in order to improve the stock price informativeness, whereas overvalued firms tend to do the contrary.

The sales of the product occur over two periods, namely the season (first period) and the off-season (second period). Apart from the stocking quantities for the two periods, firms must decide the quality levels of the units to stock for the second selling period. Firms incur a cost to maintain particular quality levels. The equilibrium policies of the firms are characterized, and we discuss the impact of the firms’ quality costs on their inventory and quality decisions. We identify the conditions of the quality costs when competition ceases to exist in the second period, and analyse the impact of the quality costs on inter-temporal price fluctuations and product availability. Using the unconstrained equilibrium policy, we frame the firms’ inventory disposal policies when production yields are exogenous.

Why do competing sellers adopt different pricing schemes for the same information good? We show that pricing schemes affect buyers’ usage levels and thus the revenue generated from them. This is reflected in differences in buyers’ demand elasticity under different pricing schemes. We propose and formalize a concept we call Congruousness to measure the level of fit between pricing schemes and buyer segments. We show that firms can use pricing schemes with different congruousness to differentiate themselves from competing firms in a friction-free market for a commoditized information good. Under conditions that are known to result in the Bertrand equilibrium, we show that an undifferentiated duopoly of sellers can earn substantial profits by using different pricing schemes in a strategic manner. Contrary to prior literature, we show that the strategy of adopting asymmetric pricing schemes can be a Nash equilibrium for information goods with negligible marginal costs of production. We extend our model to the case of information goods that are horizontally differentiated and show that sellers will offer a single pricing scheme that is different from its competitor when the sellers are weakly differentiated. When the sellers are strongly differentiated, each seller will offer multiple pricing schemes. We show that it can be optimal for a seller to offer multiple pricing schemes — metered and flat fee pricing schemes even in the absence of transactions costs.

We find that tax depreciation exerts a critical influence over the replacement policy by lowering the operating cost thresholds. Although typically a decline in the corporate tax rate, increase in any initial capital allowance, or decrease in the depreciation lifetime (increase in depreciation rate) results in a lower operating cost threshold which justifies replacing older equipment, these results are not universal, and indeed for younger age assets the result may be the opposite. An accelerating depreciation schedule may incentivize early replacement in a deterministic context, but not necessarily for an environment of uncertainty.

Examples include the cellular phone that takes digital pictures and plays MP3’s, the PDA with cell phone, and multi-function office machines. We describe these multi-function devices as fusion products since they fuse together products which traditionally stand alone in the marketplace. In this paper, we investigate the manufacturer’s fusion product planning decision adopting a market offering perspective which allows us to address the design and product portfolio decisions simultaneously. The general approach adopted is to develop and analyze a profit maximizing model for a single firm which integrates product substitution effects in identifying an optimal market offering. In the general model, we demonstrate that the product design and portfolio decisions are analytically difficult to characterize since number of possible portfolios can be extremely large. To resolve this, we propose an algorithm which identifies the optimal solution and the corresponding product design. The managerial insight from a stylized all-in-one model and numerical analysis is that the manufacturer should in most cases select only a subset of fusion and singlefunction products to satisfy the market’s multi-dimension needs. This may explain why the function compositions available in certain product markets are limited. In particular, one of the key factors driving the product portfolio decision is the margin associated with the fusion products. If a single all-in-one fusion product has relatively high margins, then this product likely dominates the product portfolio. Also, the congruency of the constituent single function products is an important factor. A portfolio of single function products is considered to be fairly congruent if it is easy to create a fusion product from them and that the newly fused product is serving a similar market as the original single-function products. When substitution effects are relatively high (i.e. the product set is more congruent), a portfolio containing a smaller number of	algorithm;electronic markets;mp3;mobile phone;multi-function printer;numerical analysis;personal digital assistant	Yuwen Chen;Janice E.

However, it ignores the customer’s bargain-hunting behavior and risk preference measure of the newsvendor. As a result, we carry out the rational expectation (RE) equilibrium analysis for risk-averse newsvendor facing forwardlooking customers who anticipate future sales and choose purchasing timing to maximize their expected surplus. We propose the equations satisfied by the RE equilibriumprice and quantity for the risk-averse retailer in general setting and the explicit equilibrium decisions for the casewhere demand follows the uniformdistribution andutility is a general power function.We identify the impacts of the system parameters on the RE equilibrium for this specific situation. In particular, we show that the RE equilibrium price for some risk-averse newsvendors is lower than for a risk-neutral retailer and the RE equilibrium stocking quantity for some risk-averse newsvendors is higher than for a risk-neutral retailer. We also find that the RE equilibrium sale price for a risk-averse newsvendor is decreasing in salvage price in some situations.		Tie Wang;Qiying Hu	2013	J.

Since the outcome under decentralized control is inefficient, cooperation among firms by means of coordination of actions may improve the individual profits. Cooperation is studied by means of cooperative game theory.

5f054ba8bc1e19f61e14e24d06654ba130b1280d	spectrum trading algorithm based on memory in cognitive radio network		In cognitive radio networks, the most important goal of spectrum sharing is to benefit both the seller and buyer. In order to increase the total benefits generated in spectrum sharing, this paper introduces a memory mechanism between the spectrum agent and multi-primary service providers PSPs and proposes a spectrum trading algorithm based on the mechanism. In this algorithm, all PSPs compete with each other and sell their idle spectrum resource to the agent to maximise their own profits. Then, the agent auctions the spectrum resources obtained in multi-secondary users. Finally, a new auction pricing function is designed to decrease the auction trading prices and increase the benefits of secondary users. Nash equilibrium is considered to be the optimal result. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides 10-15% margin over the conventional algorithm both in the price and spectrum quantity.

Examples include garden hoses and sprinklers, chips and dip, and routine versus personalized services where the former has a broader base for utility generation and the latter is more dependent on the other's presence. Measuring asymmetric effects is difficult when all that is observed are the purchase quantities present in a consumer's market basket. We propose a direct utility model with a latent decision sequence for measuring asymmetric effects that allows us to capture differential responses to cross-category purchases and inventories. Scanner panel data of milk and cereal purchases are used to investigate the presence of asymmetric complementarity, and implications are explored through counterfactual analyses involving cross-price elasticities and spillover effects of merchandising variables.

The timing and magnitude of retail store markdowns: Evidence from weekends and holidays. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 110, 2, 1995, 321–352.] show that in traditional off-line markets, prices on average tend to be lower on weekends despite higher aggregate demand. Their explanation for this effect is rooted in the existence of consumers’ search and transportation costs. We argue that since these costs are significantly reduced in many online retail market environments, this ‘‘weekend effect” should be weakened substantially. Our empirical evidence suggests that in fact, there are few statistically significant day-ofthe-week price differences in the online markets we study, and the estimated magnitude of these differences is quite small. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this research, we examine the impact of free sampling of information goods on the dynamics of online WOM and retail sales by analyzing a simultaneous equation system in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in online software market. We find that free sampling of information goods asymmetrically moderates the positive feedback mechanism between online WOM and retail sales. More adoptions of free trial not only directly lead to more retail sales but also enhance online WOM effect. Nevertheless, more adoptions of free trial generate fewer WOM and weaken the impact of past sales on WOM, which could potentially have a negative impact on future sales.	cloud computing;commercial software;positive feedback;sampling (signal processing);simultaneous equations model	Wenqi Zhou;Wenjing Duan	2012			marketing;sales management;advertising;business;commerce	AI	-3.147390992546317	-8.316461259571811	163127

We perform first known Price of Anarchy type analyses with detailed comparison of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction and one based on minimum pay property (MPP) which is similar to Generalized Second Price auction commonly used in sponsored search. Without cardinality constraints, MPP has the same efficiency (total value to bidders) and at least as much revenue (total income to the auctioneer) as VCG; this also holds for certain other generalizations of MPP (e.g., prefix constrained auctions, as we show here). In contrast, our main results are that, with cardinality constraints, (a) equilibrium efficiency of MPP is 1/2 of that of VCG and this factor is tight, and (b) in equilibrium MPP may collect as little as 1/2 the revenue of VCG. equilibrium efficiency of MPP is 1/2 of that of VCG and this factor is tight, and in equilibrium MPP may collect as little as 1/2 the revenue of VCG.	anarchy;cardinality (data modeling);edmund m. clarke;emoticon;goodyear mpp;search engine marketing	Mangesh Gupte;Darja Krushevskaja;S.

f3a9cf8d42a222daf66d5b8e06922f071488443f	learning, convergence and economic constraints		This article investigates a partial equilibrium production model with dynamic information aggregation. Firms use observed prices to estimate the unknown model parameter by applying Bayesian learning. In the baseline setting, the demand structure is linear and the noise term is Gaussian. Then, prices and quantities are supported by the real line and convergence of the limited information to rational expectations quantities is obtained. Since a production economy is considered, the economic constraint of non-negative quantities is imposed. This non-negativity constraint and the assumption that signals about demand are only received in periods where production takes place destroy the “optimistic” convergence result observed in the baseline model. With this constraint firms learning an unknown demand intercept parameter exit with strictly positive probability, even when the true value of this parameter would induce production in the full information setting. In a second step, the linear demand structure is replaced by piece-wise linear demand, such that prices become non-negative. Also in this stetting the convergence result of the baseline model does not hold.

Under fairly general demand and cost functions, producers form naïve expectations about future prices and select their output so as to maximize expected profits. Unlike the traditional setup, producers have the choice between two markets, and tend to enter that which was more profitable in the recent past. Such a switching process implies time-varying aggregated supply schedules, thus representing a further source of nonlinearity for the dynamics of prices. Analytical investigations and the numerical simulation of a particular case with linear demand and supply indicate that such interactions may destabilize otherwise stable markets and generate complex dynamics.	complex dynamics;computer simulation;interaction;naivety;nonlinear system;schedule (computer science);steady state	Roberto Dieci;Frank H.

In the proposed approach the bids are assumed to be convex quadratic functions of the production quantity. The demand is endogenously determined. The ISO problem aims to maximize the total welfare of the market. The demand being elastic, this total welfare take into account at the same time the willingness to pay of the aggregated consumer, as well as the cost of transactions. The market clearing will determine the market price in a pay-as-clear way. An explicit formula for the optimal solution of the ISO problem is obtained and the optimal price is proved to be unique. We also state some conditions for the existence of equilibria for this electricity market with elastic demand.

New buyers and objects may arrive at random times. Buyers’ private values, however, are not persistent. Instead, buyers draw new values in every period; equivalently, objects are heterogeneous but are drawn from the same distribution. We consider the use of the second-price auction for selling these objects. In equilibrium, buyers do not bid their true value. Instead, they shade their bids down by their continuation value, which is the option value of participating in future auctions. We show that this option value depends not only on the number of buyers currently present on the market, but also on anticipated market dynamics. We also generalize our results to the setting in which values correspond to a “buyer’s market” or a “seller’s market” and market conditions evolve, with persistence, from one to the other.	continuation;heterogeneous computing;persistence (computer science);persistent data structure;randomness	Maher Said	2011	Games and Economic Behavior	10.1016/j.geb.2010.12.010	financial economics;vickrey auction;economics;belief;common value auction;repeated game;microeconomics;expected value;commerce;forward auction	ECom	-1.5439501003133886	-2.854138439485418	164422

We investigate the welfare effect of regulating misinformation and strengthening MQSs. We find that the welfare effect of a decrease in misinformation crucially depends on the existing amount of misinformation; moreover, a more stringent MQS either improves or deteriorates welfare. Two effects figure strongly throughout our results. First, changes in misinformation and/or an MQS make price competition between firms more or less serious, causing changes in price and quantity. Second, these changes influence some consumers’ choices, leading them to change the products that they purchase. This change in consumption behavior increases or decreases inappropriate choices when misinformation is present. We extend the analysis to the case in which a high-quality firm’s quality investment is endogenously determined.	software quality	Keisuke Hattori;Keisaku Higashida	2014	Information Economics and Policy	10.1016/j.infoecopol.2014.04.004	public relations;quality control;economics;marketing;advertising	ECom	-2.7259527955571894	-7.936727062179691	165136

Sophisticated and experienced managers often disagree about which action is most likely to maximize profits for a given firm. Economic models of profit maximization, on the other hand, are—in general—easy to solve. Well-trained economists can readily discern the action which maximizes the firm’s objective function. The global maximum is unique and achievable because the objective function is designed to have this property. This paper weakens the assumption of analytically tractable objective functions. I propose a model of profit maximization in which it is, essentially, impossible for the firm to discover the global maximum. Firms have no choice but to, in the words of Charles Lindblom, “muddle through” in their attempt to find the optimal budgetary allocation in an extremely complex economic landscape [9]. Computer simulations provide details of that landscape as well as evidence that certain strategies may be more effective in difficult environments. Specifically, “patience” may be a virtue that applies to firms as well as to people.	cobham's thesis;computer simulation;expectation–maximization algorithm;loss function;maxima and minima;optimization problem	David Kane	1996			economics;public economics;operations management;welfare economics	ML	-3.0590041961716707	-3.062869234105589	165439

This is the first paper that incorporates transportation costs into auctions in a complex supply network. We introduce three incentive compatible auction mechanisms. Two of them make simultaneous production and transportation decisions so that the supply chain is cost-efficient for the quantities awarded to the buyer, and the third determines the production quantities before the shipments. We show that considerable supply chain cost savings can be achieved if production and transportation costs are considered simultaneously. However, under the typical regular-overtime production cost structure, the buyer’s payments in efficient auctions can be high so that the buyer may prefer inefficient auction protocols. We develop an efficient auction that can control the size of the buyer’s payments at the expense of introducing uncertainty in the quantity acquired in the auction.	procurement	Rachel R.

Due to the existence of di3erent delivery modes, the unit delivery cost (and hence the product cost) is formulated as a decreasing function of the lead-time. Market information can be collected in the earlier stages and used to update the demand forecast by using a Bayesian approach. The trade-o3 between ordering earlier or later is evident. The former enjoys a lower product cost but su3ers a less accurate demand forecast. The latter pays a higher product cost, but bene7ts from a lower uncertainty in the demand forecast. In this paper, a multi-stage dynamic optimization problem is formulated and the optimal ordering policy is derived using dynamic programming. The characteristics of the ordering policy are investigated and the variance of pro7t associated with the ordering decision is discussed. Numerical analyses through simulation experiments are carried out to gain managerial insights. Implementation tips are also proposed. ? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

One hundred pairs of subjects played the game over the Internet, with subjects having a few days to make their decisions in each round. Occasionally subjects are asked to enter one-period-ahead pricing strategies instead of prices. According to the elicited strategies, between 90% and 95% of subjects punish less harshly (in their initial response to a deviation) than implied by the grim trigger strategy, and do so in a way that depends on the size of the other subject’s deviation. Future earnings are highest for subjects adopting the tit-for-tat strategy, even after controlling for a subject’s past earnings.

In the presence of fixed-mobile substitution, above-cost mobile termination charge creates a trade-off on the mobile network’s profit: i.e., (i) reducing retail profit by strengthening competition for subscribers (‘‘price competition effect’’), and (ii) raising termination profit by increasing market shares (‘‘market share effect’’). Our analysis shows that the competitive effect of asymmetric regulation on mobile and fixed termination charges is decided by the interaction between these two effects, which in turn depends on the distribution of customer types. That is, above-cost termination charges are likely to be beneficial to consumers for a sufficiently large fixed-mobile type (i.e., customers choosing between mobile and fixed networks) compared to a mobile type (i.e., customers choosing between mobile networks), while they are likely to be harmful to consumers for a small fixed-mobile type. It would be an important implication for regulatory authorities that there exist various factors to consider in regulating termination charges, including the industry development and market structure. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, we incorporate jumps into both stock returns and state variables, and then derive semi-analytical solutions for the optimal portfolio policy up to solving a set of ordinary differential equations to greatly facilitate economic insights and empirical applications of jump-diffusion models. To examine the effect of jump risk on investors’ behavior, we apply our results to the bond-stock mix problem and particularly revisit the bond/stock ratio puzzle in jump-diffusion models. Our results cast new light on this puzzle that unlike pure-diffusion models, it cannot be rationalized by the hedging demand assumption due to the presence of jumps in stock returns.	semiconductor industry	Yi Hong;Xing Jin	2018	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2017.08.010	hedge (finance);jump diffusion;mathematical optimization;state variable;ordinary differential equation;financial economics;bond;jump;economics;portfolio	Crypto	0.1459757749500445	-3.415398768002348	169182

The results show that when the degree of spillover is small, the incumbent’s strategic opportunity to invest in infrastructure distorts the access charge set by a regulator from a welfare perspective. In particular, when the degree of spillover is small and the incumbent’s investment cost is high (low), the incumbent has an incentive to utilize regulatory non-commitment to induce a high (low) access charge by overinvesting (underinvesting) in infrastructure.

Demand response of consumers with respect to the retail price is characterized by a Stackelberg game in the first stage, thus the first stage has two levels. A risk-aversive energy dispatch accounting for market price uncertainty is modeled by a linear robust optimization with objective uncertainty in the second stage. The proposed model is transformed to a mixed integer linear program (MILP) by jointly using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, the disjunctive constraints, and the duality theory. We propose a heuristic method to select the parameter in disjunctive constraints based on the interpretation of Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, we suggest solving an additional linear program (LP) to acquire a possible enhanced bidding strategy that guarantees a Pareto improvement on the retailer's profit over the entire uncertainty set. Case studies demonstrate the proposed model and method is valid.	disjunctive normal form;dynamic dispatch;heuristic;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrange multiplier;linear programming;mathematical optimization;newton's method;pareto efficiency;procurement;robust optimization;tucker decomposition	Wei Wei;Feng Liu;Shengwei Mei	2015	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2014.2376522	financial economics;mathematical optimization;economics;microeconomics	AI	0.050620932011993226	-3.6735880231049642	170027

A government maximizes a utilitarian social welfare function, which is the sum of weighted averages of utilities for generations, through fiscal policy, i.e., monetary transfers and taxes. Situations both with and without time discounting are considered. It is shown that if the discount factor is sufficiently close to one then the optimal policy stabilizes the economy, i.e. the equilibrium path has the turnpike property. Moreover the fiscal policy is shown to be time-consistent.

Past literature has assumed that firms respond to price promotions by promoting a product in the same category. In this paper, we extend this literature as well as the bundling literature by considering the possibility that a firm may respond to a competitor's price promotions by also offering a cross-buying or bundling discount. Using a game-theoretic model, we show that bundle discounts can help increase profits in a competitive market by creating endogenous loyalty, thereby reducing the intensity of promotional competition. We also find that bundle discounts can be used as an effective defensive marketing tool to prevent customer defection to the competition.

We formulate the problem as a generalized mean–variance model that incorporates bankrupt control over intermediate periods. Based on the Lagrangian multiplier method, the embedding technique, the dynamic programming approach and the Lagrangian duality theory, we propose a method to solve the model. A numerical example is given to demonstrate our method and show the impact of bankrupt control and market parameters on the optimal portfolio strategy.	mathematical optimization	Chanjuan Li;Zhongfei Li	2012	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2012.05.010	mathematical optimization;dynamic programming;mathematics	Robotics	1.8506737486943117	-3.3716025770811324	170955

A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to reduce these negative effects. In order to validate the GA, it is used to determine the optimal ordering policy in an online version of the MIT beer distribution game. Subsequently, the GA is applied in a number of experiments involving deterministic and random demand and lead times combined with sales promotions. It is shown how GAs can be used to dampen the impact of the bullwhip effect and can be used to assist supply managers in predicting reorder quantities along the supply chain. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimal cycle configurations of commercial engines for maximum profit are obtained by applying optimal control theory. In some special cases, the eventual state—market equilibrium—is solely determined by the initial conditions and the inherent characteristics of two subsystems; while the different ways of transfer affect the model in respects of the specific forms of the paths of prices and the instantaneous commodity flow, i.e., the optimal configuration.	control theory;entity–relationship model;initial condition;optimal control	Yiran Chen	2011	Entropy	10.3390/e13061137	mathematical economics	Metrics	0.45303818715296024	-4.098331814022373	171162

Individuals are conceptualized as “dual-selves” consisting of a long-run planner and a short-run doer. The long-run self can partly control the short-run self’s strife for immediate gratification. It is shown that the solution is structurally equivalent to the one of the standard endogenous growth model as long as self-control is sufficiently strong. Within a certain range of self-control an investment subsidy can be useful in order to reduce consumption and to increase investment, growth, and welfare of the long-run self. A consumption tax, perhaps surprisingly, is counterproductive. It induces individuals with limited self-control to consume even more.	control flow;population dynamics;strife	Holger Strulik	2016	Mathematical Social Sciences	10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2016.06.003	economics;market economy;welfare economics;labour economics	Theory	-3.96396531062566	-5.848631685291974	171687

I found that a market can accurately reflect buyers' and sellers' preferences only if the rate of injection of price information multiplied by the rate of transfer of price information falls between 0 and 2. It is argued that markets adjust themselves to this constraint in practice. The alternatives are to experience chaotic and catastrophic volatility in prices or to go out of operation. Thus, electronic commerce can provide value beyond merely speeding up operations and increasing capacity. It also helps avoid misleading behavior by both buyer and seller and allows markets to operate in a wider range of trading environments.	electronic markets;information exchange	J.

We find that women bid significantly more and earn significantly less than men in the FPA. We also find that this difference cannot be entirely explained by gender difference in risk aversion. In the SPA, we find no evidence of a gender difference in bidding, the probability of dominant strategy play or probability of overbidding. We then move a step further and investigate biological determinants of bidding behavior among women, particularly the effect of menstrual cycle. We find a sinus-like pattern of bidding in the FPA throughout the cycle, with women bidding more than their average in the follicular phase of cycle (days 6 to 13 in a 28-day cycle) and less than their average in the luteal phase of the cycle (days 16 to 23). This variation around mean is not statistically significant, though. However, when we break up the sample into contraceptive pill users and non-users, we find that almost all of the bidding variation throughout the cycle is driven by pill users, with pill non-users having a flat bidding profile. In addition, the variation around mean is statistically significant for pill users. We do not find any significant menstrual cycle effects in the SPA.

From the cable operator’s perspective, not only there are long-term concerns on the erosion of subscribership with the emergence of “cord cutters” and “cord nevers,” the shift to streaming during the online pay-tv window also diminishes the cable’s advertising revenue that depends on content popularity. By using Hotelling model with multihoming and Nash bargaining solution, we capture provider and subscriber heterogeneities and optimize payments among service providers along the content value chain. By deriving the equilibrium windowing delays under three contract negotiation settings, we also show how content quality and quantity would cause the title catalogs stay exclusive, shown syndicated, or redistributed with windowing delays.	cord-cutting;emergence;multihoming;nash equilibrium;television;world wide web	I.

Moreover, we discuss how a round-robin curtailment rule could be implemented to guarantee approximately equally curtailment ratio for generators of unequal rated capacity. Next, we consider a two-location problem, where excess renewable energy generation and demand are not co-located. We study the combined effect that curtailment schemes and line access rules have on the decision to invest in new transmission lines. In particular, we show that, for common access rules, this can lead to a Stackelberg game between transmission and local generation capacity investors, and we characterise the equilibrium of this game. Finally, we apply and exemplify our model to a concrete problem of building a transmission link in western Scotland, and we propose a mechanism for setting transmission charges that assures both that the transmission line gets built, but investors from the local community can also benefit from investing in renewable energy.	exemplification;offset binary;round-robin scheduling;theory;transmission line	Merlinda Andoni;Valentin Robu;W.

We introduce the monopoly environment in two-period and multiperiod scenarios to identify thresholds in remanufacturing operations. Next, we focus our attention on the duopoly environment where an independent operator (IO) may intercept cores of products made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to sell remanufactured products in future periods. We characterize the production quantities associated with self-selection and explore the effect of various parameters in the Nash equilibrium. Among other results, we find that if remanufacturing is very profitable, the original-equipment manufacturer may forgo some of the first-period margin by lowering the price and selling additional units to increase the number of cores available for remanufacturing in future periods. Further, as the threat of competition increases, the OEM is more likely to completely utilize all available cores, offering the remanufactured products at a lower price.

A pertinent concern of issuers of CPPI products is when to perform portfolio readjustments. One way of achieving this is through the use of rebalancing triggers; this constitutes the main focus of this paper. We propose a genetic programming (GP) approach to evolve trigger-based rebalancing strategies that rely on some tolerance bounds around the CPPI multiplier, as well as on the time-dependent implied multiplier, to determine the timing sequence of the portfolio readjustments. We carry out experiments using GARCH datasets, and use two different types of fitness functions, namely variants of Tracking Error and Sortino ratio, for multiple scenarios involving different data and/or CPPI settings. We find that the GP-CPPI strategies yield better results than calendar-based rebalancing strategies in general, both in terms of expected returns and shortfall probability, despite the fitness measures having no special functionality that explicitly penalises floor violations. Since the results support the viability and feasibility of the proposed approach, potential extensions and ameliorations of the GP framework are also discussed.	benchmark (computing);database trigger;endeavour (supercomputer);experiment;fitness function;genetic operator;genetic programming;maxima and minima;overfitting;relevance;volatility	Dietmar Maringer;Tikesh Ramtohul	2011	2011 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering and Economics (CIFEr)	10.1109/CIFER.2011.5953561	financial economics;actuarial science;economics;welfare economics	SE	2.2552251298398627	-3.736711845850813	174122

The market clears according to a locational marginal pricing mechanism, in which the independent system operator (ISO) determines the generators' production quantities so as to minimize the revealed cost of meeting demand, subject to transmission and generator capacity constraints. Under the assumption that both the ISO and generators choose their strategies simultaneously, we establish the existence of Nash equilibria for the underlying game, and derive a tight bound on its price of anarchy. Under the more restrictive setting of a two-node power network, we present a detailed comparison of market outcomes predicted by the simultaneous-move formulation of the game against those predicted by the more plausible sequential-move formulation, where the ISO observes the generators' strategy profile prior to determining their production quantities.	anarchy;marginal model;mega man network transmission;nash equilibrium;rationality;sysop	Weixuan Lin;Eilyan Bitar	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798485	pricing;nickel;games;iso image;mathematical economics	ECom	-0.7545468494938232	-3.386577664470377	174232

The variety-seeking preferences are a consequence of diminishing marginal utility for repeated consumption experiences of the same product. We find that variety-seeking preferences can either soften or intensify price competition, depending on the range of feasible qualities and the strength of consumer preference for variety. When the range of feasible qualities is small enough, prices are higher than would be obtained in the absence of variety seeking—leading to higher profits—and competing firms choose to minimally differentiate themselves from each other. On the other hand, if qualities are exogenously set to be different enough from each other then stronger preferences for variety are associated with moreintense price competition and lower profits.

Multi-attribute reverse auctions have been proposed as market institutions for electronic request for quotation buying processes. Preference revelation is a crucial question in multi-attribute reverse auctions in terms of the efficiency of auction outcomes. Results from a computer-based laboratory experiment are reported and auction outcomes are analyzed regarding the buyer’s and suppliers’ surplus, efficiency, and Pareto efficiency. The results show that suppliers make more profits when preferences are revealed, but not at the expense of the buyer, and that full revelation of the buyer’s preferences significantly increases allocational and Pareto efficiency.	pareto efficiency;request for quotation	Stefan Strecker	2003			industrial organization;bayesian efficiency;eauction;vickrey auction;reverse auction;revenue equivalence;english auction;microeconomics;auction theory;commerce;profitability index;forward auction	AI	-2.7246110097679557	-5.071859727402423	174952

Due to the additional cure-related observable data, a completely new information set is applied to predict individual default and cure events. This is a new approach in credit risk that, to our knowledge, has not been followed yet. Different firm-specific and macroeconomic default and cure-event-influencing risk drivers are identified. The significant variables allow a firm-specific default risk evaluation combined with an individual risk reducing cure probability. The identification and incorporation of cure-relevant factors in the default risk framework enable lenders to support the complete resurrection of a firm in the case of its default and hence reduce the default risk itself. The estimations are developed with a database that contains 5930 mostly small and medium-sized German firms and a total of more than 23000 financial statements over a time horizon from January 2002 to December 2007. Due to the significant influence on the default risk probability as well as the bank’s possible profit prospects concerning a cured firm, it seems essential for risk management to incorporate the additional cure information into credit risk evaluation.

It is well known that when two passive matchmakers who provide random matching services compete with entrance fees, there exists no pure-strategy equilibrium. We show that when a passive matchmaker and an active matchmaker, who provides an assortive matching service, compete with entrance fees, there exists a pure-strategy equilibrium. We also provide welfare comparison between the duopoly and a monopoly operating both the passive and active networks.

Both studies concur that no ‘best’ shopping bot exists, and all bots often present inaccurate product price and availability information. A positive relationship between the amount of incorrect product information and the number of online vendors was confirmed. Supplemental information provided to users still remains deficient.

Because different borrowers correspond to different risk-return profiles, lenders have preferences over acceptable borrowers; a borrower prefers lenders in order of the interest rates they offer to her. We investigate the question of what is a computationally feasible, ‘good’, allocation to clear this market. We design a strongly polynomial time algorithm for computing a Pareto-efficient stable outcome in a two-sided many-to-many matching market with indifferences, and use this to compute an allocation for the social lending market that satisfies the properties of stability — a standard notion of fairness in two-sided matching markets — and Pareto efficiency; and additionally addresses envy-freeness amongst similar borrowers and risk diversification for lenders.	algorithm;diversification (finance);fairness measure;many-to-many;p (complexity);pareto efficiency;peer-to-peer lending;polynomial;time complexity	Ning Chen;Arpita Ghosh	2011		10.5591/978-1-57735-516-8/IJCAI11-037	actuarial science;overnight market	AI	-2.7075073125900984	-3.2648654488601285	176634

We study how the product variety decision making in the decentralized setting affects the number of VDPs developed and produced by the manufacturer, as well as the number of products that the retailer will accept from the manufacturer. We show the value of flexibility, timeliness of information, and product development lead time reduction in three market scenarios where the retailer will elect to carry a product only if the product meets a specified target profit. Our results reveal that if the manufacturer faces a long design lead time and designs only one product line, he may be better off not lowering wholesale prices to accommodate the retailer's profit restriction. If design lead time is short, negotiation between manufacturer and retailer along with a side payment could possibly lead to a profit improving solution for both parties.

In addition, we restate Urban’s viewpoint that the restriction of zero ending-inventory is not necessary in an inventory-level-dependent demand model. Consequently, we amend Giri and Chaudhuri’s inventory model for deteriorating items by changing the objective to maximize the profits and relaxing the restriction of zero ending-inventory. Finally, we provide a couple of examples to show that both the order quantity and the profit obtained from our proposed model are significantly larger than those in Giri and Chaudhuri’s model, in which the objective is to minimize the costs.	inventory theory;nonlinear system;urban computing	Chun-Tao Chang	2004	APJOR	10.1142/S0217595904000321	inventory;economics;operations management;microeconomics;commerce	AI	2.3083485942173327	-4.725390120414952	176876

In a two-period decentralized model, this paper shows that when a market culture allows firms to make exploding offers, unraveling is more likely to occur and lead to a less socially desirable matching outcome. A market with a larger uncertainty in early stages is not necessarily more vulnerable to the presence of exploding offers: the conclusion depends on the specific information structure. A market tends to be less vulnerable to exploding offers when there is an excess supply of labor. While a banning policy on exploding offers tends to be supported by high quality firms and workers, it can be opposed by those of low qualities. This explains the prevalence of exploding offers in practice.	decentralised system;display resolution;offset binary	Siqi Pan	2018	Int. J.

The stochastic demand is refund price-sensitive. We show that the optimal refund price increases with the option price and decreases with both the wholesale and exercise prices, while the optimal order quantity increases with the exercise price, but decreases with both the wholesale and option prices. Furthermore, we illustrate that in the presence of customer returns, the optimal refund price and order quantity decrease; the firm should cut the refund price and order more products if a bidirectional option contract is available. We identify the conditions under which a firm should offer a full, partial, or no refund policy. We also show that a bidirectional option contract can reduce the negative impact of customer returns and enhance the firmu0027s profit, especially under high demand uncertainty.

The occurrence of such a hazard is known only to the firm. The regulator, if finding a hazard, collects a fine and mandates the firm to perform costly remediation that reduces the environmental damage. The regulator may inspect the firm at any time to uncover the hazard. However, because inspections are costly, the regulator also offers a reward to the firm for voluntarily disclosing the hazard. The reward corresponds to either a subsidy or a reduced fine, depending on whether it is positive or negative. Thus, the regulator needs to dynamically determine the reward and inspection policy that minimizes expected societal cost in the long run. We model this problem as a dynamic adverse selection problem with costly state verification in continuous time. Despite the complexity and generality of this setup, we show that the optimal regulation policy follows a very simple cyclic structure, which we fully characterize in closed form. Specifically, the regulator runs scheduled inspections periodically. After each inspection, the reward level decreases over time until a subsequent inspection takes place. If a hazard is not revealed, the reward level is reset to a high level, restarting the cycle. In contrast to the reward level, the mandated remediation level is constant over time. Nonetheless, when subsidies are not allowed in the industry, we show that the regulator should dynamically adjust this remediation level, which then acts as a substitute for a subsidy. Our analysis further reveals that optimal inspection frequency increases not only when the inspection accuracy decreases, but also when the penalty for not disclosing the hazard increases.

To minimise the effect of deterioration, retailers in supermarkets, departmental store managers, etc. always want higher inventory depletion rate. In this article, we propose a dynamic pre-and post-deterioration cumulative discount policy to enhance inventory depletion rate resulting low volume of deterioration cost, holding cost and hence higher profit. It is assumed that demand is a price and time dependent ramp-type function and the product starts to deteriorate after certain amount of time. Unlike the conventional inventory models with pricing strategies, which are restricted to a fixed number of price changes and to a fixed cycle length, we allow the number of price changes before as well as after the start of deterioration and the replenishment cycle length to be the decision variables. Before start of deterioration, discounts on unit selling price are provided cumulatively in successive pricing cycles. After the start of deterioration, discounts on reduced unit selling price are also provided in a cumulative way. A mathematical model is developed and the existence of the optimal solution is verified. A numerical example is presented, which indicates that under the cumulative effect of price discounting, dynamic pricing policy outperforms static pricing strategy. Sensitivity analysis of the model is carried out.	ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability	Shibaji Panda;Subrata Saha;Manjusri Basu	2013	Int. J.

b2dfcf2ff5fd81ac760fc5d7707ef8acc0c42b7e	two-stage stochastic international portfolio optimisation under regular-vine-copula-based scenarios		An international portfolio allows simultaneous investment in both domestic and foreign markets. It hence has the potential for improved performance by exploiting a wider range of returns, and diversification benefits, than portfolios investing in just one market. However, to obtain the most efficient portfolios (along with the usual management of assets) the risks from currency fluctuations need good management, such as by using appropriate hedging. In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic international portfolio optimisation model to find an optimal allocation for the combination of both assets and currency hedging positions. Our optimisation model allows a “currency overlay”, or a deviation of currency exposure from asset exposure, to provide flexibility in hedging against, or in speculation using, currency exposure. The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are also included. To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return distributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine copula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of the characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and asymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the uncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio optimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated from the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a standard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the proposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios that give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario generation approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return compensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher returns. The paper shows that it can be important to model the nonnormality in uncertainty, and not just assume normal distributions.	algorithm;cryptocurrency;diversification (finance);foreign exchange service (telecommunications);interdependence;mathematical optimization;performance;stochastic optimization;tree structure;vine toolkit	Nonthachote Chatsanga;Andrew J.

2f5500fb8abd8cc5c3ee30328c94d52a86b4a95b	price dispersion under the adverse selection environment	price discrimination;adverse selection	The price dispersion means different prices for same goods. In the Internet economy, many economists reckon that the price dispersion in the e-commerce markets should descend along with the dropping of search cost. However, the correlative empirical studies reach a contrary opinion: there not only exist price dispersion in the e-commerce market, but also has larger dispersion degree than the traditional market, thereby gaining a ‘price paradox’ that is inconsistent with traditional economic principle. Based on the adverse selection Perspective, this paper puts up a new interpretation about the price dispersion in the e-commerce markets. Actual data from five online markets in China serves as a case study to help analyze the characteristics of the price dispersion. Finally, the paper probes into resolving approaches eliminating and decreasing price dispersion in order to raise the business efficiency in the e-commerce markets.	e-commerce;online shopping	Yong Pan	2013			adverse selection;price dispersion;microeconomics;price discrimination;financial economics;economics	ECom	-2.3218200748056215	-9.329420606007737	178646

The inventory information misalignment between them contributes to the failure of order fulfillment and demand satisfaction, and hence the associated penalties are incurred. In this article, we first analyze the penalties of ignoring such information discrepancy on both the drop-shipper and the online retailer. We then assess the impact of information discrepancy on both parties when the drop-shipper understands the existence of the information discrepancy but is not able to eliminate the errors. The numerical experiments indicate that both parties can have significant amount of the percentage cost reductions if the information discrepancy can be eliminated, and the potential savings are substantial especially when the errors have large variability. Furthermore, we observe that the online retailer is more vulnerable to information discrepancy than the drop-shipper, and the drop-shipper is likely to suffer from the online retailer's underestimation of the physical inventory level more than the problem of its overestimation. Moreover, even if eliminating errors is not possible, both parties could still benefit from taking the possibility of errors into consideration in decision making.	discrepancy function;drop shipping	Taesu Cheong;Mark Goh;Sang Hwa Song	2015	Decision Sciences	10.1111/deci.12122	marketing;operations management;commerce	AI	-2.600286488319825	-8.368023561765044	179135

Manufacturing firms are significant contributors to carbon emissions. In many countries, regulatory authorities are taking actions to reduce emissions. Carbon taxation and cap-and-trade schemes are two mechanisms implemented in many countries. In the present paper, the author analyzes a production-inventory model under a carbon tax system. The production rate is assumed to be a decision variable and can be set at any level within machine limits. A proportion of items produced are defective, and this proportion depends on the production rate. Demand depends on the selling price. Unit price is a decreasing function of the production rate. Emissions can be reduced to some extent by capital investment on green technology, and this capital investment amount is a decision variable. Customers are categorized as retail customers and wholesale customers. A discount is offered to the wholesale customers on the regular selling price. The results are illustrated by a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis is performed.		Tapan Kumar Datta	2017	Adv.

We assume that the inverse demand function is linear and that firms operate at constant but possibly distinct marginal costs.

Second, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition, depending on the heterogeneity of firms’ marginal costs, under which the core is nonempty.		Dongshuang Hou;Aymeric Lardon;Theo S. H.

It is based on strong interaction and reliable collaboration between vendor(s) and buyer(s), which is acquiring growing importance in today’s industrial reality. Unlike most literature focusing on single-vendor single-buyer models and deterministic customer demand, a single-manufacturer (vendor) multi-retailer (buyer) generic model is developed under stochastic customer demand in this study. In order to understand the potential benefits of CP, it is compared with a traditional policy (TP) model developed in the similar approach. The models are tested with two scenarios of uniform and exponential demand distributions of the retailers. The results show how CP works better than the traditional uncoordinated optimization. It not only helps the manufacturer to generate higher profit, but also coordinates retailers to achieve a higher supply chain profit. At the same time, each retailer earns at least as much as they do in TP. Further price discount sensitivity analysis demonstrates the efficiency of CP when facing price-demand fluctuation.

One dimension of greening the supply chain is extending the forward supply chain to collection and recovery of products in a closed-loop configuration. Remanufacturing is the basis of profit-oriented reverse logistics in which recovered products are restored to a marketable condition in order to be resold to the primary or secondary market. In this paper, we introduce a multiechelon multicommodity facility location problem with a trading price of carbon emissions and a cost of procurement. The company might either incur costs if the carbon cap, normally assigned by regulatory agencies, is lower than the total emissions, or gain profit if the carbon cap is higher than the total emissions. A numerical study is presented which studies the impact of different carbon prices on cost and configuration of supply chains.	embedded system;facility location problem;inventory;logistics;numerical analysis;procurement	Ali H.

While the literature has provided insights into the design of the partial-refund policy, little attention has been directed at the design of the quota-based return policy. Accordingly, this paper explores the relative preference of a quota-based policy vis-a-vis a partial-refund policy. We do this, first, in the context of risk-neutral channel partners to identify the strategic decisions of each party and the effect of demand uncertainty on the variation of their respective profits. Our results reveal that the manufacturer faces higher profit variation (between the different demand realizations) under the quota policy. The variance in profits for the reseller is, however, higher under the partial-refund policy. We explain the source of profit variations by comparing it across different channel structures (centralized and decentralized). Next, we formally extend the model to include a disutility ass...	optimal design	Thanh Tam Tran;Haresh Gurnani;Ramarao Desiraju	2018	Marketing Science	10.1287/mksc.2018.1094	microeconomics;optimal design;economics;reseller;profit (economics)	EDA	-1.3727763328503513	-6.512061621475877	180837

The result thus begs the question as to why manufacturers of perishable commodities widely accept full returns of unsold stock as the norm. We model the environment as one where two capacity-constrained manufacturers compete for shelf space with the same retailer, and we show that a complete-credit returns policy is in fact the only possible equilibrium of the game. Our results obviate the need for knowing the exact functional form of the demand distribution in order to compute the returns credit, as Pasternack's results would require. From a retailer's standpoint, we establish a simple procurement strategy and show that it is optimal. The same game with price-only contracting has a pure-strategy equilibrium when the supplier capacities are below a threshold value and a mixed-strategy equilibrium when the supplier capacities cross this threshold but are still so limited that no single supplier can with certainty supply all the quantity demanded.

ee1887cfa01538af34c8d8246dd7bee59ca76d5a	"""a stochastic competitive research and development race where """"winner takes all"""" with lower and upper bounds"""		The paper analyzes an environment in which several firms compete over the development of a project. Each firm decides how much to invest in the project while adhering to firm-specific lower and upper investment bounds. The completion time of the project by a firm has exponential distribution with rate that depends linearly on the investment of the firm. The firm that completes the project first collects all its revenues whereas the remaining firms earn nothing. The paper establishes the existence and uniqueness of both the Nash equilibrium and the globally optimal solution, provides explicit representations parametrically in the interest rate, and constructs computationally efficient methods to solve these two problems. It also examines sensitivity of Nash equilibrium to marginal changes in lower and upper bounds.	algorithmic efficiency;marginal model;maxima and minima;nash equilibrium;regular expression;time complexity	Pelin G.

In both settings, the stores procure their products from a common warehouse and each consumer purchases from the closest store. The retailers in the decentralized system want to maximize their individual profits determined by the sales revenue minus the transportation costs for replenishment and consumer travels. The retail chain in the centralized system wants to maximize the sum of the two individual profits. Transportation costs depend on not only fuel consumption but also carbon emission. In the decentralized system, we establish that both retailers choose the same location in equilibrium in high margin markets. Numerical experiments provide further insights into the location problem: The retail chain chooses different locations for its stores at optimality in all instances. However, under low transportation costs, the retailers in the decentralized system choose the same location in equilibrium. As the consumer transportation costs increase, the stores are located further away from each other towards their respective consumer segments, converging to the centralized solution. Carbon penalty is more effective for consumer travels than for replenishment in reducing excess emissions due to competition.

This paper reports the results of a laboratory experiment to study the implications of rising inequality on the tendency to burn others' income. The experiment considers an environment where higher earnings are typically associated with higher effort and varies how fair and transparent this relationship is. The findings indicate that increasing inequality does not per se lead to more money burning. Rather, it depends on whether the increase in inequality can be unequivocally attributed to exerted effort. If subjects can tweak the income-generating process in their favor, money burning is substantially higher. Low-income subjects are more likely to burn others' income and most of the money burning is aimed at subjects with higher incomes.	social inequality	Dietmar Fehr	2018	Games and Economic Behavior	10.1016/j.geb.2017.11.001	economics;public economics;welfare economics;labour economics	ECom	-4.183800222932686	-6.872766188774554	182252

We show that, when banks can adjust their capital structures, reductions in real interest rates lead to greater leverage and higher risk for any downward sloping loan demand function. However, if the capital structure is fixed, the effect depends on the degree of leverage: following a decrease in interest rates, well capitalized banks increase risk, while highly levered banks may decrease it if loan demand is linear or concave. Further, the capitalization cutoff depends on the degree of bank competition. This effect therefore should vary across countries and over time. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We study an SCF system with a manufacturer selling a product to a retailer that faces uncertain demand over a single period. We assume that either the retailer or the manufacturer faces a capital constraint and must borrow capital through an online P2P lending platform. The platform determines a service rate for the loan, the manufacturer sets a wholesale price for the product, and the retailer chooses its order quantity for the product. We identify optimal Stackelberg strategies of the participants in the SCF system. For an SCF system with a capital-constrained retailer, we find that the retaileru0027s optimal order quantity and the manufactureru0027s optimal wholesale price decrease with the platformu0027s service rate. For an SCF system with a capital-constrained manufacturer, we find that as the platformu0027s service rate increases, the manufactureru0027s optimal wholesale price increases but the retaileru0027s optimal order quantity decreases. Our analysis suggests that it is important for the retailer and the manufacturer to take the online P2P lending platformu0027s financial decisions (such as the service rate) into account when making their operational decisions.	peer-to-peer lending	Guang-Xin Gao;Zhi-Ping Fan;Xin Fang;Yun Fong Lim	2018	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2017.12.006	mathematics;operations management;economic order quantity;supply chain management;supply chain;stackelberg competition;loan;peer-to-peer;finance	ECom	-0.5409644097404258	-5.623866999107339	182753

We consider a buyer facing multiple potential suppliers, each having an associated (exogenous) reliability that quantifies its risk of supply failure. We design optimal mechanisms that depend on the buyer's level of information regarding the suppliers' cost of production and reliability. When supplier reliability is known, we find that the optimal allocation resembles the allocation under full information, but with inflated production costs. When it is unknown, the same result is true when cost and reliability of a supplier are independent. Furthermore, the buyer does not have to pay any rent for information on suppliers' reliability. Moreover, we assess the benefits of the optimal mechanism compared to traditional auctions that ignore supply risk.	procurement	Aadhaar Chaturvedi;Víctor Martínez-de-Albéniz	2011	Manufacturing & Service Operations Management	10.1287/msom.1100.0319	information asymmetry;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;economics;operations management;microeconomics;commerce	HCI	0.9280821801429961	-5.646159124158419	183226

The paper presents empirical findings about these preferences. The investigation is based on the assumption that the probability of a continuous compensation, instead of a final payment, increases when the negotiation power of the supplier rises. The results confirm this presumption with regard to the power determinants of effective intellectual property rights and the number of cooperation alternatives. In contrast to that suppliers, who control the complementary assets themselves, have no explicit preference.

This strategy leads to market segmentation and has been shown to be optimal by many researchers. On the other hand, researchers have also demonstrated, under certain restrictive conditions, that vertical differentiation may not be optimal for information goods. We analyze vertical differentiation for a monopolist, continuing the practice of modeling consumer valuation as a linear function of product quality and consumer type but generalizing assumptions about marginal costs and consumer distributions. We show that the firm's optimal product line depends on the benefit-to-cost ratio of qualities in the choice vector. We find that a vertical differentiation strategy is not optimal when the highest quality product has the best benefitto-cost ratio. Many information goods satisfy this property.	vertical market software	Hemant K.

The first way has divisible money, take-it-or-leave-it offers by buyers, and a transfer scheme financed by money creation. If agents are suffi ciently patient, the first best is achieved for finite money growth rates. If agents are impatient, the equilibrium allocation approaches the constrained-effi cient allocation asymptotically as the money growth rate tends to infinity. The second way has indivisible money, take-it-or-leave-it offers by buyers, and no government intervention. We discuss the strict implementation of constrained-effi cient allocations and the applicability of our scheme to economies with Lucas trees, endogenous participation, match-specific heterogeneity, and sequential competitive markets.

A key feature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network effect. In particular, each consumer’s usage level depends directly on the usage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist’s optimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents, who have a central position in the underlying network. Our results can be summarized as follows. First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized prices and derive an explicit characterization of the optimal price for each consumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it is optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that is proportional to her Bonacich centrality in the social network. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist that can only choose a single uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the number of agents to compute such a price. Thirdly, we assume that the monopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and study the problem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We show that the problem is NP-hard, however we provide an explicit characterization of the set of agents that should be offered the discounted price. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set of agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price allocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88 % of the optimal profit. Finally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits of a monopolist that does not take into account the network effects when choosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist that uses this information optimally.	approximation algorithm;centrality;embedded system;monopoly;np-hardness;polynomial;social network	Ozan Candogan;Kostas Bimpikis;Asuman E.

In our model, items have unlimited supply, and agents are unit demand. In a departure from previous literature, we assume agents have value based external- ities, meaning that their valuation depends not only on their own sig- nal, but also on the signals of other agents in their neighborhood who win the item. We give a complete characterization of ex-post incentive compatible and individually rational auctions in this setting. Using this characterization, we show that the optimal auction is in fact determin- istic, and can be computed in polynomial time when the agents' signals are independent. We further show a constant factor approximation when the signals of agents are correlated, and an optimal mechanism in this case for a constant number of bidders.

0aeadd555251c5949ab36406e71d648d51ecc7d0	product variety, pricing and differentiation in a supply chain	competition;customization;product differentiation;search cost;supply chain;product variety	Manufacturers typically sell consumer products through retailers and the presence of intermediaries has interesting ramifications for their product variety and pricing decisions. Retailers may want higher variety to help reduce price competition but the costs of variety are borne by the manufacturer. The increased variety may increase demand and profits for the manufacturer too but this depends on market-specific factors as well as costs. We explore these interactions through a model wherein a manufacturer sells multiple product variants at a wholesale price to two retailers who in turn compete for consumers. Consumers choose between the retailers based on the price and variety offered by each retailer and the search or transportation cost incurred by the consumer, equivalent to the level of retailer differentiation in our model. Several insights emerge from the analysis. The manufacturer offers the same variety to both retailers and this variety increases with market size and consumer sensitivity to variety. We find that some retailer differentiation benefits the retailers (not the manufacturer) but too much differentiation hurts both the retailers and the manufacturer. If the market is fully covered, then the channel is coordinated even with a simple wholesale pricing contract. If the retailers incur costs to sell the product, the manufacturer surprisingly loses out more than the retailers and in fact absorbs some or all of the retailer costs. Finally, asymmetry between retailers has some unexpected consequences. For example, variety is not impacted by asymmetry in consumer preferences for a retailer and the manufacturer offers the same variety to both retailers. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Conditions for the existence and the uniqueness of the corresponding equilibrium are presented. The equilibrium is constructed explicitly and its properties in response to the incentives are studied. Following this, optimal contracts are designed from the perspective of the budget required for accurate information acquisition and sensing.	game theory;sensor	Farhad Farokhi;Iman Shames;Michael Cantoni	2015	CoRR		knowledge management;operations management;business;computer security	ECom	-1.6094596501969993	-5.331434732164534	184390

However, early provider offering service in such a band might use customer contracts which impose a penalty on customers for switching to other providers as a way of creating new entry barriers. Given such contracts, entrant providers must weigh the likelihood of customers switching to them when deciding how much to invest in the development of new technology. Furthermore, there may be information asymmetries between an entrant and an existing provider with regard to the potential efficiency of any new technology. We use a game theoretic model to study such issues and characterize the resulting impact of contracts on the overall economic welfare.	customer relationship management;game theory	Yining Zhu;Randall Berry	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)	10.1109/DySPAN.2017.7920777	actuarial science;business;commerce	Arch	-2.0211371818639545	-7.233942849589516	185202

The quest for hegemony is modeled as a game, with countries being differentiated initially only by some endowment which yields a pollution free flow of income. A country’s level of pollution is assumed directly related to its economic strength, as measured by its level of production. Two types of countries are distinguished: richly-endowed countries, for whom the return on their endowment is greater than the return they can expect from winning the hegemony race, and poorly-endowed countries, who can expect a greater return from winning the race than from their endowment. We show that in a symmetric world of poorly-endowed countries the equilibrium level of emissions is larger than in a symmetric world of richly-endowed countries.: the former, being less well endowed to begin with, try harder to win the race. In the asymmetric world composed of both types of countries, the poorly-endowed countries will be polluting more than the richly endowed countries. Numerical simulations show that if the number of richlyendowed countries is increased keeping the total number of countries constant, the equilibrium level of global emissions will decrease; if the lot of the poorly-endowed countries is increased by increasing their initial endowment keeping that of the richly-endowed countries constant, global pollution will decrease; increasing the endowments of each type of countries in the same proportion, and hence increasing the average endowment in that proportion, will decrease global pollution; redistributing from the richly-endowed in favor of the poorly-endowed while keeping the average endowment constant will in general result in an increase in the equilibrium level of global pollution.	numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;open road tolling;simulation	Johnson Kakeu;Gérard Gaudet	2011	Dynamic Games and Applications	10.1007/s13235-011-0023-6	development economics;economics;hegemony;microeconomics;economy;mathematical economics;sequential game;economic growth	ML	-3.6508776945215557	-5.638049123925733	185504

Recent literature argues that individuals’ apparent preference for smaller menus can be explained by choosers’ behavioral biases or informational limitations. These explanations imply that absent behavioral or informational effects, larger menus would be objectively better. However, in an important economic context — 401(k) pension plans — we find that larger menus are objectively worse than smaller menus, as measured by the maximum Sharpe ratio achievable. We propose a model in which menu setters differ in their ability to pre-select the menu. We show that when the cost of increasing the menu size is sufficiently small, a lower-ability menu setter optimally offers more items in the menu than a higher-ability menu setter. Nevertheless, the menu optimally offered by a higher-ability menu setter remains superior. This results in a negative relation between menu size and menu quality: smaller menus are better than larger menus.	heart rate variability	David Goldreich;Hanna Halaburda	2013	Management Science	10.1287/mnsc.2013.1718	marketing;operations management;advertising	HCI	-4.013619077367871	-8.139184062746674	186097

The defense strategies include both actions where security generates positive externalities and actions that do not. When the players are assumed to be risk averse, market insurance enters as a third strategic option. We formulate a one-shot security game with market insurance, characterize its pure equilibria, and describe how the equilibria compare to established results. Simplifying assumptions include homogeneous players, fair insurance premiums, and complete information except for realizations of nature. The results add more realism to the interpretation of analytical models of security games and might inform policy makers on adjusting incentives to improve network security and foster the development of a market for cyber-insurance.	cyber-insurance;network security;risk aversion	Benjamin Johnson;Rainer Böhme;Jens Grossklags	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25280-8_11	actuarial science;public economics;key person insurance;business;commerce	AI	-3.465323662766442	-3.941603694090092	186148

And Market impact cost and timing risk cost of the three strategies are proved to be negative correlated. Moreover, we get the result that the timing risk cost of VWAP strategy is the highest and that of IS strategy is the lowest, while the situation of market impact cost is opposite.	algorithmic trading;futures and promises;performance;risk assessment	Chaoteng Jordan Chen;Xiaotao Liu;Kin Keung Lai	2013	2013 Sixth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering	10.1109/BIFE.2013.61	financial economics;economics;finance;microeconomics	DB	-0.42490652952974256	-7.952880159432883	186237
ecdacdee239c9561475b3e5847c90e2a76c3d1f1	customer sharing in economic networks with costs		In an economic market, sellers, infomediaries and customers constitute an economic network. Each seller has her own customer group and the selleru0027s private customers are unobservable to other sellers. Therefore, a seller can only sell commodities among her own customers unless other sellers or infomediaries share her sale information to their customer groups. However, a seller is not incentivized to share othersu0027 sale information by default, which leads to inefficient resource allocation and limited revenue for the sale. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel mechanism called customer sharing mechanism (CSM) which incentivizes all sellers to share each otheru0027s sale information to their private customer groups. Furthermore, CSM also incentivizes all customers to truthfully participate in the sale. In the end, CSM not only allocates the commodities efficiently but also optimizes the selleru0027s revenue.

5174df6cbd628471a3d594f2677f1e75b173facb	optimal patent policy in the presence of vertical separation		We examine a license contract in vertically separated markets, in which an inventor and a manufacturer bargain over royalties. The hold-up problem is found to be bilateral in that not only the licensor but also the licensee can delay the introduction of new technology. Given the probabilistic validity of patents and penalty upon infringement as patent instruments, we derive the optimal policies as a mix of them; not only can they always maximize the total amount of wealth but also they allocate the wealth according to each firm’s contribution to the introduction of new technology. From the perspective of patent reform, our model supports the entire market value rule on the ground that it can always yield the first-best result. We also show that there is scope for self-correction in the market; even without the government’s intervention, firms can adjust their bargaining power to improve social welfare to a certain extent. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ecc8dc7db75946367561fe6ded7d354479f4f1ec	the voracity effect revisited		In an influential article Tornell and Lane (1999) considered an economy, populated by multiple powerful groups, in which property rights in the formal sector are not protected. They argued that then investment in an informal sector may be optimal and set up conditions for “voracity” such that a permanent positive shock in the formal sector leads to lower economic growth. Here I show that whenever investing in the informal sector is feasible, not investing in the informal sector is a Pareto-superior Nash equilibrium under the mild condition of an elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption smaller than unity. As a corollary, voracity disappears.	elasticity (cloud computing);mass effect trilogy;nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;population	Holger Strulik	2012	Mathematical Social Sciences	10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2012.05.007	economics;microeconomics;mathematical economics;welfare economics;labour economics	AI	-3.9232801963768376	-5.530145487157354	186888

Online retailers employ various strategies, such as reviewer reputation systems and online communities, to encourage consumers to write online product reviews. Monetary incentives---a widely used extrinsic motivation in the business world---are not commonly used by online retailers to encourage consumers to write online product reviews. One plausible explanation is because of the cost of monetary incentives, albeit the trade-off between the cost of monetary incentives versus the benefit of having more online product reviews has not been examined. With a unique panel data set from a major Chinese online retailer that has been offering monetary incentives to encourage consumers to write product reviews, we examine how monetary incentives affect online product reviews and sales. Interestingly, we find that small rewards---less than 1.5 yuan for each product review, can increase product sales significantly. Our findings suggest that paying for product reviews can be an effective strategy for online retailers to increase sales.	online community;online shopping;panel data;reputation system	Paul A.

For each year in the explicit forecast period, there is an individual forecast of free cash flow. On the other hand, all of the years in the post-horizon period are represented through one single continuing value formula, being the steady-state value of the firm’s productive assets at the horizon. Continuing value is typically derived by applying the Gordon formula to a simple extrapolation of free cash flow at the end of the explicit forecast period. This paper examines the components of continuing value, in particular capital expenditures and tax savings due to depreciation of property, plant and equipment (PPE). The estimation of two somewhat elusive parameters related to capital expenditures, equipment economic life and capital intensity, is discussed. A further analysis indicates that a substantial part of continuing value derives from cash flow associated with already acquired equipment. Also, the error resulting from assuming steady-state rather than lumpy capital expenditures is identified. Implementation issues relating to the explicit forecast period are also commented on. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

96d018d615af08b8626083a333afe573beadf67d	research note - performance-based advertising: advertising as signals of product quality	sponsored search;signaling;performance based pricing;quality;advertising	Performance-based advertising is becoming increasingly popular in the online advertising industry, where advertisers pay the publisher only when the advertisement generates an “action” (e.g., a click-through or a purchase). This paper illustrates that adopting this emerging advertising scheme has profound impacts on one fundamental function of advertising---signaling product quality. We identify several important dimensions that affect the signaling function of performance-based advertising relative to its traditional counterpart (impression-based advertising). These include: (1) information---total advertising expenditure is determined after the demand is realized, so it is unobservable to consumers when making purchase decisions; (2) ad performance---the measured “performance” (e.g., recorded click-throughs) includes actions generated by first-time buyers (i.e., advertising performance) and actions generated by repeat buyers (i.e., product performance), which increases the cost of signaling through advertising; (3) demand uncertainty---the merchant pays only when a response to the advertisement is generated, which reduces the merchant's advertising uncertainty. We build a model of performance-based advertising by explicitly incorporating these factors, and we derive the conditions under which switching to performance-based advertising will (a) disable or strengthen the signaling function of advertising, (b) help or hurt the merchant, and (c) lead to a higher or lower advertising expenditure.

To disentangle the joint effects of performance on compensation and distress risk, we focus our analyses on new CEOs. Our results indicate that financial distress risk affects compensation through two channels. First, new CEOs receive significantly more compensation when financial distress risk is higher. This finding is consistent with CEOs receiving a compensation premium for bearing this risk since CEOs experience large personal costs if their firms later become financially distressed. Second, financial distress risk is associated with the incentives provided to new CEOs; distress risk is positively associated with pay-performance sensitivity and equity-based compensation and is negatively associated with cash bonuses. Further, financial distress risk is positively associated with pay-risk sensitivity for new CEOs. These findings suggest that financial distress risk alters the nature of the agency relationship in ways that lead firms to provide CEOs with more equity-based incentives. We also build on research that finds a positive relation between forced turnover risk and CEO compensation. Our analyses suggest the compensation effects of forced turnover risk appear to be mainly attributable to financial distress risk. Overall, our results indicate financial distress risk is an economically important determinant of new CEO compensation packages.

The seller seeks to implement a profit-maximizing non-linear pricing scheme, which includes the time at which the good is shipped to the consumer. If the buyer discounts future payoffs and the seller does not, then delayed shipments act as an almost-perfect substitute for complete information and the monopolist can extract almost all of the surplus from trade. Shipping policies thus serve as a powerful tool of enhancing price discrimination. However, if the seller is as patient as, or even only slightly more patient than, the buyer, then she cannot benefit from delaying allocations.

Many common games in industrial organization, political economy, public economics, and macroeconomics can be cast as aggregative games. This paper provides a general and tractable framework for comparative static results in aggregative games. We focus on two classes of games: (1) aggregative games with strategic substitutes and (2) nice aggregative games, where payoff functions are continuous and concave in own strategies. We provide simple sufficient conditions under which positive shocks to individual players increase their own actions and have monotone effects on the aggregate. The results are illustrated with applications to public good provision, contests, Cournot competition and technology choices oligopoly.	aggregate data;aggregate function;cobham's thesis;concave function;nist hash function competition;visual effects;monotone	Daron Acemoglu;Martin Kaae Jensen	2013	Games and Economic Behavior	10.1016/j.geb.2013.03.009	strategic complements;cournot competition;economics;comparative statics;microeconomics;mathematical economics;welfare economics	ECom	-2.027607349440854	-3.5232219305358092	188580

We argue that if protection is nevertheless imperfect, this transition will generally lower the prices of content relative to perfect legal enforcement. However, the effect on prices depends on whether the content providers use independent protection standards or a shared one, and if shared, on the governance of the system. Even if a shared system permits content providers to set their prices independently, the equilibrium prices will depend on how the vendors share the costs, and prices may be higher than with perfect legal protection. We show that demand-based cost sharing generally leads to higher prices than revenuebased cost sharing. Users, vendors and the antitrust authorities will typically have different views on what capabilities the DRM system should have. We argue that, when a DRM system is implemented as an industry standard, there is a potential for “collusion through technology.”	digital rights management;encryption	Yooki Park;Suzanne Scotchmer	2005			advertising;business;internet privacy;computer security	ECom	-3.292273550042281	-7.663091435202194	188618

6e6c097031bd67366e30db8b1c6c4ebc49153648	dynamic pricing for perishable items with costly price adjustments		Dynamic pricing is widely adopted in inventory management for perishable items, and the corresponding price adjustment cost should be taken into account. This work assumes that the price adjustment cost comprises of a fixed component and a variable one, and attempts to search for the optimal dynamic pricing strategy to maximize the firm’s profit. However, considering the fixed price adjustment cost turns this dynamic pricing problem to a non-smooth optimal control problem which cannot be solved directly by Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Hence, we first degenerate the original problem into a standard optimal control problem and calculate the corresponding solution. On the basis of this solution, we further propose a suboptimal pricing strategy which simultaneously combines static pricing and dynamic pricing strategies. The upper bound of profit gap between the suboptimal solution and the optimal one is obtained. Numerical simulation indicates that the suboptimal pricing strategy enjoys an efficient performance.

The best responses of the firms are first determined and the partial adjustment toward best responses is assumed in formulating a dynamic model. The steady states are first characterized and the dynamic behavior of the output trajectories is demonstrated by computer simulation. With small number of firms and low speeds of adjustments the trajectories converge to a steady state. This convergence is lost with increasing number of firms and/or larger speeds of adjustment giving the possibility of cycles and even chaotic behavior.	contingency (philosophy)	Ugo Merlone;Ferenc Szidarovszky	2015	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2014.02.003	complex dynamics;repeated game;mathematics;oligopoly	ECom	-0.13317280472461288	-9.820861803036427	190803

When some decision-making units (DMUs) face higher input prices than other DMUs, the Farrell decomposition of cost efficiency can potentially indicate that a firm with lower overall costs of production is less efficient than a firm that uses fewer physical inputs, but has higher costs. We extend our gain functions accounting for cases where DMUs face different input prices. An empirical illustration of our method is provided using data on Japanese banks operating during 2000–2003.

Moreover, the SOC-rule is introduced and analysed as a cost allocation rule for this type of situations. In the current paper it is seen that n-person EPQ situations with shortages lead to exactly the same class of cost games. Furthermore, an alternative characterization of the SOCrule is o¤ered, primarily based on a transfer property which constitutes a special form of additivity. Necessary input variables for the SOC-rule are the (optimal) individual average number of orders per time unit in case there is no cooperation. Assuming that these average numbers are observable but not verifiable, we allow the players to select them strategically, while knowing that the SOC-rule will be (consecutively) applied as the cost allocation principle.

ASPs are “service firms that provide a contractual service offering to deploy, host, manage, and lease what is typically packaged application software from a centrally managed facility.” The application software products offered by ASPs range from standard productivity tools to expensive applications such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems like SAP or PeopleSoft. In this paper, we model the economic dynamics between the ASP and its potential customers. Under a realistic economies-of-scale assumption, we show that there exists a unique rational expectation equilibrium. Optimal pricing policies for the ASP are derived analytically and insights are demonstrated through numerical explorations.	darknet market;erp;enterprise resource planning;loss function;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;numerical method;portable document format;self-propelled particles;server (computing);value (ethics);world wide web	Hsing Kenneth Cheng;Gary J.

We focus on the following tradeoff: Disclosing some information may be necessary to prevent a market breakdown, but disclosing too much information destroys risk-sharing opportunities (Hirshleifer effect). We find that during normal times, no disclosure is optimal, but during bad times, partial disclosure is optimal. We characterize the optimal form of this partial disclosure. We relate our results to the Bayesian persuasion literature and to the debate on disclosure of stress test results.	firing squad synchronization problem;mitchell corporation;personally identifiable information;stress testing (software)	Itay Goldstein;Yaron Leitner	2018	J.

We show that options are not redundant when small proportional transaction costs of size ε are added to the model, which provides mathematical evidence for the common belief of traders that delta-gamma hedging is superior to just delta hedging. When options are not present, the minimal loss in the value function for the expected final utility due to the presence of transaction costs is O ( ε2/3 ) . When options are present, we show the minimal loss can be reduced to O ( ε6/7 ) . Further, we compute the explicit leading order optimal strategy and the coefficient for the O ( ε6/7 ) term.	bellman equation;black–scholes model;coefficient;traders	Jonathan Goodman;Daniel N.

Entry occurs by investing irreversibly before competing in quantities. When a post-entry first-mover market advantage is persistent, we examine how the firms’ relative “alertness” drives the equilibrium outcomes. If the firms detect the new demand immediately (perfect alertness), equilibrium entry decisions are always sequential. Preemption occurs, rent dissipation is monotone in the magnitude of the market advantage, which reduces both firms’ expected value, and rent-equalization is preserved. If the firms detect the new demand relatively late (imperfect alertness), the equilibrium outcomes differ qualitatively from those in standard real option games: (i) In case of symmetric detection, the probability of simultaneous entry is nonzero (it can be one). When preemption occurs there is no rent equalization, with the post-entry first-mover market advantage resulting in higher equilibrium expected value to the leader; (ii) In case of asymmetric detection, the more alert firm postpones entry by investing exactly when its rival detects demand, and preemption always occurs, again to the benefit of the leader. The positive marginal effect of the first-mover advantage on the leader’s equilibrium value increases in the inter-firm alertness differential; (iii) With more demand volatility the impact of imperfect alertness on the entry sequence is less likely, and the value differential across firms decreases. This always benefits the second entrant, which enters even later, and possibly at a loss for the leader. JEL classification: C73; D43; D92; L13.

Exporting used products to a physically separate market not only removes cannibalization for new products at home, but also fetches additional revenue. In this paper, we investigate the implications of exporting used products to international secondary markets in the durable goods industry. We find that such a practice may significantly stimulate new product lease on the home market, an effect in which the market attractiveness and product quality are mutually reinforcing. We discover that removing cannibalization pressure is more of a priority than generating additional revenue while exporting used products. If the export is carried out by an agent, who exports used products bought from OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), we observe the disadvantage of double marginalization in a channel structure, which slows down export and causes quantity distortion, and also reduces the effectiveness of government stimulus. However, if the agent and OEM set export price based supply and demand equilibrium, this reduces the quantity distortion. One special characteristic of used products trade across borders is the involvement of governments on both sides of the border. The government measures include penalties imposed on aging durable goods and trade barriers. We find that legislation of penalizing used products on the domestic market can stimulate export, but it does not have an intended effect of stimulating new products produced at home. The channel structure worsens the problem. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

The order cycle time and the demand are allowed to be triangular fuzzy numbers. In the process industry, this is a situation that often occurs, since the production equipment typically manufactures a large amount of only one product at a time. The model is developed and solved with Lagrange multipliers.

Inequality in household wealth has increased even more dramatically, with the share of the top 1% doubling since 1976. Perhaps, the most notable technological change over the past 30 years has been the widespread diffusion of computers in the United States. However, when we consider the aggregate time-series regression results, we find that the largest effects on income inequality come from equipment investment and unionization. OCA investment is also found to have a positive and significant effect on income inequality, though not as strong as equipment investment. On the other hand, TFP and labour productivity growth, as well as R&D investment, have no statistical effect on income inequality. Unionization has a decidedly negative effect on income inequality. With regard to wealth inequality, the only two significant effects come from the ratio of the S&P 500 stock index to median house, which has a very strong positive relation, and the minimum wage in constant dollars, which has a negative and less strong relation. None of the other variables is statistically significant. However, investment in OCA per worker has a very strong positive relation to movements in stock prices, which suggests that it is indirectly linked to changes in wealth inequality.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results suggest the following conclusions. The hierarchy of switching costs is mobile phone service, fixed phone service, ISP (Internet Service Provider), and broadband access service, in descending order. Even if the government prohibits the formerly state-owned monopoly NTT from forming alliances with other carriers, the legacy NTT group would still command more than half of the market share under FMC if each carrier adopts a pure bundling strategy. If mixed bundling emerges as the primary strategy in the FMC market, the resulting type of competition from the introduction of FMC does not stimulate competitive pricing.

c1c1505d47891acc4ce6d4d385f4ef2121123981	perishability of data: dynamic pricing under varying-coefficient models		We consider a firm that sells a large number of products to its customers in an online fashion. Each product is described by a high dimensional feature vector, and the market value of a product is assumed to be linear in the values of its features. Parameters of the valuation model are unknown and can change over time. The firm sequentially observes a product’s features and can use the historical sales data (binary sale/no sale feedbacks) to set the price of current product, with the objective of maximizing the collected revenue. We measure the performance of a dynamic pricing policy via regret, which is the expected revenue loss compared to a clairvoyant that knows the sequence of model parameters in advance. We propose a pricing policy based on projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) and characterize its regret in terms of time T , features dimension d, and the temporal variability in the model parameters, δt. We consider two settings. In the first one, feature vectors are chosen antagonistically by nature and we prove that the regret of PSGD pricing policy is of order O( √ T + ∑T t=1 √ tδt). In the second setting (referred to as stochastic features model), the feature vectors are drawn independently from an unknown distribution. We show that in this case, the regret of PSGD pricing policy is of order O(d log T + ∑T t=1 tδt/d).	coefficient;feature vector;regret (decision theory);spatial variability;stochastic gradient descent;value (ethics)	Adel Javanmard	2017	Journal of Machine Learning Research		financial economics;economics;marketing;operations management;microeconomics;mathematical economics;statistics	ML	1.1983987337802302	-3.7262124828394065	194068
6481a65d7867df3cfbb7ad1dbb3cd97270df9618	volume flexibility and capacity investment: a real options approach		This paper considers the investment decision of a firm where it has to decide about the timing and capacity. We obtain that in a fast-growing market, right after investment the firm produces below capacity, where the utilization rate (the proportion of capacity that is used for production right after the investment) increases with market uncertainty for a very big market trend, and shows no monotonicity for a moderately large market trend. On the other hand, we get that, for a slowly growing or shrinking market, the firm produces up to capacity right after investment. In the intermediate case, the firm produces up to capacity right after investment when uncertainty is low and below capacity when uncertainty is high, whereas the utilization rate decreases with the market uncertainty.

In order to achieve the goal, a computer simulated market where only a small fraction of the population observe the risky asset's fundamental value with noise was constructed, while the rest of agents try to forecast the asset's price from past transaction data. The paper departs from previous studies in that the risky asset does not pay a dividend every period, so agents cannot learn from past transaction prices and subsequent dividend payments. The main finding is that information can potentially disseminate in the market as long as: (1) informed investors' trades tilt transaction prices in the fundamental path direction; and (2) the median investor's expectation is very responsive to transaction prices. Otherwise, markets may display crashes or bubbles. It is found that the first condition requires a minimal amount of informed investors, and is severely limited by short selling and borrowing constraints.	computer simulation;constraint (mathematics);crash (computing);population;rational agent;traders;transaction data	Javier Gil-Bazo;David Moreno;Mikel Tapia	2005	2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2005.1555001	computer simulation;pricing;variable pricing;rational agent;computer science;transaction data	ECom	-1.0495003153567055	-9.231217057358053	194511
c11995fdb6b2c14ad0c98d7e470c9acb8266fdec	strategic sales management in an autonomous trading agent for tac scm	trading agents	To operate successfully in a competitive trading environment such as the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management (Collins et al. 2004) (TAC SCM), an agent has to allocate resources and set prices in a way that maximizes its expected profit. This requires the ability to detect changing market conditions and act accordingly. In TAC SCM six agents buy parts, assemble personal computers, and sell them in daily auctions to customers. Sales decisions in our agent, MinneTAC, are driven by three different models: an automated characterization and prediction of market conditions, which we call economic regimes(Ketter 2005), a linear program that optimizes daily sales quotas, and a model of order acceptance probability. While economic regime models are commonly used at the macro economic level (Osborn & Sensier 2002), such predictions are rarely done for a micro economic environment. We focus on the sales decisions the agent has to make, where predicting prices and customer demand play an essential role. The strategies we present have been inspired, among others, by the work of Kephart et al. (Kephart, Hanson, & Greenwald 2000). MinneTAC makes sales decisions in two steps. The first step is astrategic decision , where resources are allocated over a planning horizon in a way that maximizes expected profit over the horizon. The second step is a tactical decision, which determines the offer prices that are expected to sell the quantities determined by the strategic decision, g iven the current demand and the pricing model.	autonomous robot;category utility;linear programming;personal computer	Wolfgang Ketter;Eric Sodomka;Amrudin Agovic;John Collins;Maria L.

To address this question, we study a two-stage advertising game between a franchisor and two adjacent franchisees. In the first stage of the game, the franchisor chooses between three advertising models - centralizing or delegating the two types of advertising to the franchisees or delegating only promotional advertising. In the second stage, given the franchisor's choice of an advertising model, the two franchisees decide whether or not to cooperate. Our main findings are that (1) the franchisees should cooperate if the franchisor delegates either both brand-image and promotional advertising or promotional advertising, although cooperation between franchisees does not necessary improve the franchisor's profits. (2) The choice of an advertising arrangement critically depends on the margins as well as the costs of performing both promotional and brand-image advertising. We also discuss the conditions under which the three advertising models should be implemented.	online advertising	Simon Pierre Sigué;Pradeep Chintagunta	2009	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2008.09.027	public relations;game theory;profit;systems modeling;economics;native advertising;marketing;advertising account executive;brand;advertising;cooperation;profitability index	Robotics	-1.7657766301778204	-5.43350015925034	195601

Theoretical literature on mixed oligopolies, in fact, provides results and policy implications that crucially rely on the notion of equilibrium assumed, either sequential or simultaneous. In the framework of the endogenous timing model of Hamilton and Slutsky (1990), we show that simultaneous play never emerges as the equilibrium of mixed duopoly games. We provide sufficient conditions for the emergence of public and/or private leadership equilibria. These results are in sharp contrast with those obtained in private duopoly games in which simultaneous play is the general result. We show that the key difference lies in the fact that the objective of a welfare maximizing firm is generally increasing in the rival’s output, while the contrary holds for private firms. We develop a comprehensive analysis of a mixed duopoly considering both the cases of domestic and international competition, and the possible strategic complementarity and substitutability. From a methodological viewpoint we make large use of the basic results of the theory of supermodular games in order to avoid extraneous assumptions such as concavity, existence and uniqueness of the equilibria.	concave function;emergence;nash equilibrium;supermodular function	Rabah Amir;Giuseppe de Feo	2014	Int.

In this article, we focus on the scenario in which the inventory is in short supply, i.e. an e-marketplace with limited inventory (EMLI). The challenges are in two-fold: (a) for sellers who aim to maximize their profit, they may intentionally conduct dishonest transactions since the limited products are likely to be sold out regardless of their reputation; (b) for buyers who intend to gain the limited products, they may provide untruthful ratings to mislead other buyers. To address these issues, we propose an incentive mechanism to promote buyer and seller honesty for this type of e-marketplaces. Specifically, the mechanism models the honesty of buyers and sellers as scores and reputation, respectively. It then offers a higher price to the products of more honest sellers (with higher reputation) and allocates the products to more honest buyers (with higher scores). In this way, both sellers and buyers are well encouraged to be honest. Furthermore, we impose proper membership fee on new sellers to cope with the whitewashing attack. We finally theoretically analyze and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism and its nice properties.	e-commerce;emoticon;reputation system	Yuan Liu;Jie Zhang	2014	Electronic Commerce Research and Applications	10.1016/j.elerap.2013.11.002	marketing;voluntary exchange;microeconomics;commerce;forward auction	AI	-3.5402120988624506	-7.440142349777991	196802

In a two-tier collaborative channel, a partneru0027s relative standing is manifest in the order in which wholesale and retail prices are determined; in turn, standing influences a partneru0027s ability to achieve profits. We propose a framework, based on two factors that specify the strength of partners across channel tiers (channel leadership) and within a tier (echelon dominance) and together determine a partneru0027s standing in the pricing process, to effectively study various channel strength scenarios. Our analysis of Stackelberg games corresponding to these scenarios reveals interesting insights regarding the impact of channel leadership and echelon dominance, both individually and jointly. For instance, we show that the presence of a dominant player in the upstream manufacturing tier benefits both the dominant and the weak manufacturers. The leadership-dominance framework also allows us to study the effect of a retaileru0027s sequencing of its pricing of the two manufacturers’ products. By embedding the retaileru0027s timing choices in channel strength scenarios, we find that both retailer and weak manufacturer prefer that the retailer set prices for the two products simultaneously; in contrast, the echelon-dominant manufacturer benefits from the retailer sequentially pricing the manufacturers’ products. Our analysis also covers preeminent channel leaders that control both wholesale and retail prices, finding that preeminent partners achieve significant gains and consumers benefit from low retail prices. Moreover, the weak manufacturer benefits from the presence of a preeminent manufacturer.

Keeping the net profit structure constant, we examine three payment schemes that can be interpreted as the newsvendor’s order being financed by the newsvendor herself (scheme O), by the supplier through delayed order payment (scheme S), and by the customer through advanced revenue (scheme C). In a laboratory study, we find that inventory quantities exhibit a consistent decreasing pattern in the order of schemes O, S, and C, with the order quantities of scheme S being close to the expected-profit-maximizing solution. These observations are inconsistent with the expected-profit-maximizing model, contradict what a regular or hyperbolic time-discounting model would predict, and cannot be explained by the loss aversion model. Instead, they are consistent with a model that underweights the order-time payments, which can be explained by the “prospective accounting” theory in the mental accounting literature. A second study shows that the results hold even if all physical payments are conducted at the same time, suggesting that the framing of the payment scheme is sufficient to induce the prospective accounting behavior. We further validate the robustness of our model under different profit conditions. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the psychological processes involved in newsvendor decisions and have implications for supply chain financing and contract design.	framing (world wide web);inventory;newsvendor model;prospective search;risk aversion	Li Chen;A.

38f757d424c3fabef8852b512ecc831301059a9c	game-theoretical model for marketing cooperative in fisheries		The classical game-theoretical models described the conflict in fisheries arising from harvesting a ‘common pool resource’ which without an efficient regulation leads to an overexploitation of a renewable but not unlimited resource, known as the ‘tragedy of the commons’. Unlike these studies, the present paper deals with a marketing cooperative of micro or small enterprises in fishing industry, formed to negotiate a contracted price with large buyers, sharing risk among members of the cooperative. In the paper a game-theoretical model for the behaviour in this cooperative is set up. By the time of the actual commercialization of the product, the market price may be higher than what the cooperative can guarantee for members, negotiated on beforehand. Therefore some “unfaithful” members may be interested in selling at least a part of their product on the free market, the cooperative, however, can punish them for this. This conflict is modelled with a multi-person normal form game. An evolutionary dynamics is proposed for the continuous change of the applied strategies, which in the long term leads to a particular Nash equilibrium, considered the solution of the game. This strategy dynamics is continuously influenced by an “exosystem” describing the dynamics of fishing, based on a classical fishing effort model. This approach focuses only on the conflict within the marketing cooperative, since it is supposed that the single enterprises fish from independent resources. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the adoption of this practice can induce the supplier to build bigger capacity. The higher capacity level enables the supplier to satisfy a larger portion of demands from the downstream firm, and this leads to higher payoffs for both parties in the supply chain. With the assistance of an under-capacity penalty imposed on the supplier, this premium-payment scheme can help lure the parties into taking the channel-optimal actions. Our numerical examples help reveal various features of the scheme. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We provide an alternative and somewhat complementary approach that considers demand-related issues, such as the existence of green segments, original equipment manufacturer competition, and product life-cycle effects. The profitability of a remanufacturing system strongly depends on these issues as well as on their interactions. For a monopolist, we show that there exist thresholds on the remanufacturing cost savings, the green segment size, market growth rate, and consumer valuations for the remanufactured products, above which remanufacturing is profitable. More important, we show that under competition remanufacturing can become an effective marketing strategy, which allows the manufacturer to defend its market share via price discrimination.	existential quantification;interaction;logistics;nist hash function competition	Atalay Atasu;Miklos Sarvary;Luk N.

It is shown that a monopolist’s optimal pricing schedule can be characterized as a simple combination of the zero-piracy pricing schedule and a piracy-indifferent pricing schedule that makes all customers indifferent between legal usage and piracy. An increase in the quality of pirated goods, while lowering prices and profits, increases total surplus by expanding both the fraction of legal users and the volume of legal usage. In the absence of price discrimination, a seller’s optimal level of technology-based protection against piracy is shown to be at the technologically maximal level, which maximizes the difference between the quality of the legal and pirated goods. However, when a seller can price discriminate, its optimal choice is always a strictly lower level of technology-based protection. These results are based on the following digital rights conjecture: that granting digital rights increases the incidence of digital piracy, and that managing digital rights therefore involves restricting the rights of usage that contribute to customer value. Moreover, if a digital rights management system weakens over time due to the underlying technology being progressively hacked, a seller’s optimal strategic response may involve either increasing or decreasing its level of technology-based protection. This direction of change is related to whether the DRM technology implementing each marginal reduction in piracy is increasingly less or more vulnerable to hacking. Pricing and technology choice guidelines are presented, and some welfare implications are discussed.	digital rights management;incidence matrix;marginal model;maximal set	Arun Sundararajan	2004	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.1040.0030	internet protocol;adverse selection;actuarial science;economics;computer science;marketing;digital rights management;microeconomics;information good;management;law;price discrimination;computer security;intellectual property;commerce;profitability index	ECom	-2.8712540498157386	-7.56324014060844	198891

A sanctioning approach, holding the service provider liable for monetary losses resulting from data breaches, may provide the spur to increase security investments. In this paper, we review and compare two approaches to determine sanctions for the service providers, where the sanction is proportional respectively to the expected damage suffered by the customer and to the product of that damage and the service providers' revenues. The comparison is conducted by examining the game modelling the interaction between the customer and the service provider. In a typical scenario, the approach based on the service provider's revenues leads to larger security investments (for any degree of exposure of the customer) and to a stronger reduction of the data breach probability.	data breach;information security;interaction;personally identifiable information	Maurizio Naldi;Marta Flamini;Giuseppe D'Acquisto	2013	Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technologies (FGCT 2013)	10.1109/FGCT.2013.6767202	public relations;service level objective;actuarial science;business;computer security	SE	-3.318135347633512	-8.620592304802438	198989
