ebadf08356d409423036386ccf586173ecddd593	a logic-based approach for evaluating interpretability of fuzzy rule-based classifiers	fuzzy rules;fuzzy rule base;classification accuracy;fuzzy classifier	We describe an automatic approach for evaluating interpretability of fuzzy rule-based classifiers. The approach is based on the logical view of fuzzy rules, which are interpreted as rows in truth tables. These truth tables are subject of a minimization procedure based on a variant of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. The minimized truth tables are used to build new fuzzy rules, which are compared with the original ones in terms of classification accuracy. If the two sets of rules have similar performances, we deduce that the logical view of rules is applicable to the fuzzy classifier, which is hence considered interpretable. On the other hand, a significant difference in classification ability shows that fuzzy rules cannot be interpreted in logical terms, hence linguistic labelling may not be significant. Two illustrative examples show both the cases.

Since knowledge can be expressed in a more natural by using fuzzy sets, many decision problems can be greatly simplified. However, standard type-1 fuzzy sets have limitations when it comes to modelling human decision making. In many applications involving the modelling of human decision making (expert systems) the more traditional membership functions do not provide a wide enough choice for the system developer. They are therefore missing an opportunity to produce simpler or better systems. The use of complex non-convex membership functions in the context of human decision making systems were investigated. It was demonstrated that non-convex membership functions are plausible, reasonable membership functions in the sense originally intended by Zadeh. All humans, including ‘experts’, exhibit variation in their decision making. To date, it has been an implicit assumption that expert systems, including fuzzy expert systems, should not exhibit such variation. Type-2 fuzzy sets feature membership functions that are themselves fuzzy sets. While type-2 fuzzy sets capture uncertainty by introducing a range of membership values associated with each value of the base variable, but they do not capture the notion of variability. To overcome this limitation of type-2 fuzzy sets, Garibaldi previously proposed the term ‘non-deterministic fuzzy reasoning’ in which variability is introduced into the membership functions of a fuzzy system through the use of random alterations to the parameters. In this thesis, this notion is extended and formalised through the introduction of a notion termed a non-stationary fuzzy set. The concept of random perturbations that can be used for generating these non-stationary fuzzy sets is proposed. The footprint of variation (FOV) is introduced to describe the area covering the range from the minimum to the maximum fuzzy sets which comprise the non-stationary fuzzy sets (this is similar to the footprint of uncertainty of type-2 sets).

This paper discusses five types of existing neighborhoodbased generalized rough sets. The concepts of minimal neighborhood description and maximal neighborhood description of an element are defined, and by means of the two concepts, the properties and structures of the third and the fourth types of neighborhood-based rough sets are deeply explored. Furthermore, we systematically study the covering reduction of the third and the fourth types of neighborhood-based rough sets in terms of the two concepts. Finally, two open problems proposed by Yun et al. 2011 are solved.		Zhaohao Wang;Lan Shu;Xiuyong Ding	2011	J.

Up to date, DRSA has been widely used in multi-criteria decision-making problems. In these real-life problems, however, since the collected data are evolving from time to time, there are often some variations of the attribute sets or object sets. In the dynamic information systems, the frequent update of the lower and upper approximations of DRSA is an necessary step for further updating attribute reducts and decision rules which are important for knowledge discovery and decision-making. Incrementally updating approximations is a type of effective methods to reduce the computational load when any variation occurs. Most of current studies on incremental methods only consider conventional rough set models and the situation when a single object varies in an information system. In this paper, we focus on the variations of object sets and discuss incremental methods of updating approximations of DRSA when multiple objects changed. The updating principles in different dynamic situations are given with detail proofs and the corresponding incremental algorithms are also developed. The experimental evaluations on 12 UCI data sets show that our proposed incremental approaches effectively reduce the computational time in comparison with the non-incremental approach as well as a typical incremental method in the literature.	approximation algorithm;computation;dominance drawing;dominance-based rough set approach;dynamic problem (algorithms);effective method;experiment;information system;real life;time complexity;turing completeness	Yan Li;Yongfei Jin;Xiaodian Sun	2018	Int.

We consider two groups of studies on attribute reduction. Attribute reduction can be interpreted based on either decision preservation or region preservation. According to the fact that probabilistic regions are non-monotonic with respect to set inclusion of attributes, attribute reduction for region preservation is different from the classical interpretation of reducts for decision preservation. Specifically, the problem of attribute reduction for decision preservation is a decision problem, while for region preservation is an optimization problem.	rough set;theory	Yan Zhao;S. K.

34395a2343bcab46cfecfb95388e8ef208d5424b	generation of reducts and threshold functions and its networks for classification		Dimension reduction of data is an important issue in the data processing and it is needed for the analysis of higher dimensional data in the application domain. Rough set is fundamental and useful to reduce higher dimensional data to lower one for the classification. We develop generation of reducts by using partial data for the classification in which their operations derive reducts without using all the data. The nearest neighbor relation plays a fundamental role for generation of reducts and threshold functions using the Boolean reasoning on the discernibility and in discernibility matrices, in which the indiscernibility matrix is proposed here to test the sufficient condition for reduct and threshold function. Finally, reduct-threshold network is proposed for the higher classification accuracy.

No single source of information (decision or feature) can provide the absolute solution when detection and recognition problems become more complex and computationally expensive (e.g., in land mine detection). However, complementary information can be derived from multiple sources. In this paper, we build a decision-based fusion system based on the uncertainty approach utilizing an extension of the Choquet fuzzy integral (generalized Choquet fuzzy integral, GCFI). The difference between the standard Choquet fuzzy integral and the GCFI is that the GCFI integrates vectors of fuzzy numbers instead of vectors of numeric membership values. The system is applied to a land mine detection problem. The fuzzy vectors represent uncertainty in both the confidence and location estimates of several detection algorithm outputs. The results show a huge improvement in the probability of detection and a reduction in the false alarm rate over the best algorithm and two numeric fusion schemes, i.e., the average confidence and a decision level fusion with the numeric Choquet fuzzy integral. The GCFI obtains 100% probability of detection at 0.02 false alarm rate per square meter on a large test set, whereas the best detection algorithm and the average confidence achieve only 91% and 96% probability of detection at that rate. Additionally, at 0.02 false alarm rate, decision level fusion with the numeric Choquet fuzzy integral reaches only 87% probability of detection.	integral theory (ken wilber)	Sansanee Auephanwiriyakul;James M.

We completely solve an open problem on filters of BL-algebras posed by M. Haveshki et al. Moreover, we investigate prime filters of residuated lattices, and by using the software MATHEMATICA, we also give a counterexample to show the distinction between prime filters of residual lattices and one of MTL-algebras.	bl (logic);boolean algebra;fuzzy logic;residuated lattice;t-norm	Yongquan Wang;Xiaohong Zhang;Zhi-qing Shao	2007	Fourth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2007)	10.1109/FSKD.2007.206	fuzzy logic;boolean algebra;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;boolean domain;ideal;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;mathematics;fuzzy set;boolean prime ideal theorem;two-element boolean algebra	Robotics	-0.2592288319207463	-24.210372984439267	198977
