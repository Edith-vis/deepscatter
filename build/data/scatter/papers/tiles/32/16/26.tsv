Tel.: +33 145818399. E-mail address: stefano.secci@telecom-paristech In this paper, we study the inter-domain Autonomous System (AS)-level routing problem within an alliance of ASs. We first describe the framework of our work, based on the introduction of a service plane for automatic multi-domain service provisioning. We adopt an abstract representation of domain relationships by means of directional metrics which are applied to a triplet (ingress point, transit AS, egress point) where the ingress and egress points can be ASs or routers. Then, we focus on the point-to-point and multipoint AS-level routing problems that arise in such an architecture. We propose an original approach that reaches near optimal solutions with tractable computation times. A further contribution of this paper is that a heavy step in the proposed heuristic can be precomputed, independently of the service demands. Moreover, we describe how in this context AS-level path diversity can be considered, and present the related extension of our heuristic. By extensive tests on AS graphs derived from the Internet, we show that our heuristic is often equal or a few percent close to the optimal, and that, in the case of precomputation, its time consumption can be much lower than with other well-known algorithms. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One example is the messaging service for disaster alerts, rescue workers, and victims. Many of these messaging services are developing based on existing messaging services and in ad hoc manner to meet the communication requirements in different disaster scenario. However, most, if not all, existing messaging services are designed under the assumption that the underlying network infrastructures are mostly reliable. Unfortunately, this assumption is not valid during and after disasters. In this work, we designed and implemented a service recovery framework, including a landmark-based/centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm, for publish/subscribe messaging services for disaster management. The developed mechanisms recover a failed service without manual efforts. The centralized algorithm uses a landmark node to monitor the services and to recover the failed one, the distributed algorithm is a Paxos-based algorithm to compile a consistent recovery plan among nodes, monitoring the failed service. We evaluated the performance for these two mechanisms, and discussed the proper use scenario for these two mechanisms. The results show that the centralized algorithm should only be used in a service network having no concurrent failure within a local area network, the distributed algorithm are neither sensitive to concurrent failures nor the size of service networks.	centralized computing;compiler;cyber-physical system;disaster recovery plan;distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language);publish–subscribe pattern;requirement	Chi-Sheng Shih;Hsin-Yi Chen;Zi-You Yeh	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, Networks, and Applications	10.1109/CPSNA.2014.27	communications protocol;algorithm design;computer science;service delivery framework;database;computer security;algorithm;disaster recovery;emergency management;computer network	Mobile	-1.9571361764686737	79.39775012960651	149332

Compared with unirate multicasting, this provides more flexibility to the users and allows more efficient usage of the network resources. In this paper, we simultaneously address the route selection and rate allocation problem in multirate multicast networks; that is, the problem of constructing multiple multicast trees and simultaneously allocating the rate of receivers for maximizing the sum of utilities over all receivers, subject to link capacity and delay constraints for high-bandwidth delay-sensitive applications in point-to-point communication networks. We propose a genetic algorithm for this problem and elaborate on many of the elements in order to improve solution quality and computational efficiency in applying the proposed methods to the problem. These include the genetic representation, evaluation function, genetic operators, and procedure. Additionally, a new method using an artificial intelligent search technique, called the coevolutionary algorithm, is proposed to achieve better solutions, and methods of selecting environmental individuals and evaluating fitness are developed. The results of extensive computational simulations show that the proposed algorithms provide high-quality solutions and outperform existing approach.	computation;computer simulation;core-based trees;evaluation function;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;genetic representation;heuristic;mathematical optimization;molecular dynamics;multicast;network congestion;press statistic;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);requirement;signature block;simulation;springer (tank);steady state;telecommunications network;top-down and bottom-up design;user requirements document	Sun Jin Kim;Mun Kee Choi	2006	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-006-0014-2	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;combinatorial optimization;point-to-point;computer science;artificial intelligence;user requirements document;genetic operator;evolutionary algorithm;evaluation function;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;network congestion;computer network	Mobile	-2.736659495584445	81.07358897910105	149436

At such problems sizes, the space of all simple cycle structures on the network graph cannot even be known in practice, let alone put into a conventional ILP problem instance. The approach being taken is a combination of GA methods with ILP; GA is guided by a subsidiary ILP surrogate problem to preselect a set of collectively high merit candidate cycles to populate a size-reduced final fully detailed ILP. Feasible solutions of high quality have been obtained for an initial 200node test case. Comparison of the result by other workers is invited.	cycle (graph theory);cycles and fixed points;display resolution;network planning and design;population;software release life cycle;test case	Diane Prisca Onguetou;Wayne D.

We introduce our strategy Friendly Clustering that won the Performance Award. Friendly Clustering is based on monitoring the neighbors' forwarding behavior and assessing their willingness to relay future data packets.

Hence, with low node mobility, traffic may be concentrated on several nodes, which results in long end-to-end delay due to congestion at the nodes. Furthermore, since some specific nodes are continuously used for long duration, their battery power may be rapidly exhausted. Expiration of nodes causes connections traversing the nodes to be disrupted and makes many routing requests be generated at the same time. Therefore, we propose a load balancing approach called Simple Load-balancing Approach (SLA), which resolves the traffic concentration problem by allowing each node to drop RREQ or to give up packet forwarding depending on its own traffic load. Meanwhile, mobile nodes may deliberately give up forwarding packets to save their own energy. To make nodes volunteer in packet forwarding we also suggest a payment scheme called Protocol-Independent Fairness Algorithm (PIFA) for packet forwarding. To evaluate the performance of SLA we compare two cases where AODV employs SLA or not. Simulation results show that SLA can distribute traffic load well and improve performance of entire ad-hoc networks.	ansi escape code;algorithm;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);inverted-f antenna;load balancing (computing);network congestion;network packet;network topology;routing;service-level agreement;simulation	Younghwan Yoo;Sanghyun Ahn	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25978-7_5	telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;packet forwarding;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-1.6017215671151903	76.43432579896792	152915

TEEMAC is a cluster-based MAC protocol where each cluster is dynamically formed based on cluster-head. Numerical analysis is provided and it shows that the proposed MAC protocol outperforms other existing MAC protocols in terms of energy consumption.	access control	Sungrae Cho;Jin-Woong Cho;Jang-Yeon Lee;Hyun Seok Lee;We-Duke Cho	2005		10.1007/11599463_58	embedded system;media access control;wireless sensor network;energy conservation;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;access control;wireless network;efficient energy use;computer security;sensor array;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless	Mobile	-0.8127476182449437	75.94468003390648	153125

Then we present a heuristic coloration method for the hyper-edge graph, and a network coding vector allocation scheme based on maximum distance separable code is proposed to effectively overcome some link failures.

972cce9453313af520ad28e4bb280342d532a485	a novel social-based clustering and routing scheme in mobile opportunistic networks		"""In this paper, we take a real-life example to show that social relationship among nodes consists of explicit and implicit parts. Explicit social relationship comes from direct contact among nodes, and implicit social relationship can be measured through the """"circle of friends"""". Based on effective measurement of social relationship, we propose a novel social-based clustering and routing scheme. Each node selects the nodes with close social relationship to form a local cluster, and self-control method is used to keep all cluster members always having close relationship with each other. Cluster-based message forwarding mechanism is designed for opportunistic routing, in which each node only forwards the copy of the message to nodes with the destination node as a member of local cluster. Simulation results show that the proposed social-based clustering and routing outperforms the other two classic routing algorithms."""	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;distributed computing;message passing;real life;routing;simulation	Feng Zeng;Nan Zhao;Wenjia Li	2016	2016 International Conference on Identification, Information and Knowledge in the Internet of Things (IIKI)	10.1109/IIKI.2016.48	computer network;algorithm design;circle of friends;computer science;mobile computing;cluster analysis	Robotics	2.425690270598747	81.27667660966276	154105

The novelty of LAKER is that it learns from past actions to guide future behaviors. In particular, LAKER can gradually discover current topological characteristics of the network, such as population density distribution, residual battery map, and traffic load status. This knowledge can be organized in the form of a set of guiding routes, each of which consists of a chain of guiding positions between a pair of source and destination locations. The guiding route information is learned by individual nodes during route discovery phase, and it can be used to guide future route discovery processes in a more efficient manner. LAKER is especially suitable for mobility models where nodes are not uniformly distributed. LAKER can exploit topological characteristics in these models and limit the search space in route discovery processes in a more refined granularity than location aided routing (LAR) protocol. Simulation results show that LAKER outperforms LAR and DSR in term of routing overhead, saving up to 30–45% broadcast routing messages compared to LAR approach.

In IDOS there is no main or single site that handles user interactions. Instead, each new user “joins” a dynamic graph of users that are currently interested in a specific type of Buy/Sell interaction. The objects for the Buy/Sell interactions are moved between the nodes (users) of the dynamic graph. The Buy/Sell interactions are therefore realized by updating the objects whenever they pass through the current node. This should solve the communication bottleneck caused by the common use of central servers for interactions on the Internet. It does, however, pose a distributed routing problem where messages sent by the users must be distributed between all the “interested” users that are currently connected to the graph. The proposed routing algorithm should overcome the dynamic changes that occur in the graph's topology because some of the users leave the graph while others join it. The proposed solution is to use random walks to distribute the messages, so that the ever-changing topology of the dynamic graph can be overlooked. Consequently, there is no notion of addresses in the system; each user knows only how to communicate with her neighbors. The user must wait until the desired object reaches its node. This simplifies the communication layer, since the centralized client/server TCP/IP infrastructure can be replaced by a point-to-point communication system. We use a system of multiple random “postmen” to overcome the potential communications delay caused by the theoretical large cover-time required by random-walks in graphs. Experimental results of the system as well as how it can be employed to realize public auctions are discussed.	routing	Yosi Ben-Asher	2001	J. Parallel Distrib.

When the number of stations in an IBSS is very small, there is a negligible probability that stations may go out of synchronization. More the stations, higher is the probability of getting out of synchronization. Thus, the current IEEE 802.11's synchronization mechanism does not scale; it cannot support a large-scale ad hoc network. To alleviate the synchronization problem, “Adaptive Time Synchronization Procedure” (ATSP) is proposed [1]. ATSP is scalable up to 300 nodes. As the number of nodes increases beyond 300 again synchronization become problem. In this paper, we modify ATSP to further increase the scalability of IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks. The modified algorithm divides nodes in priority levels depending on their clock speed. This algorithm allows nodes only with highest priority to contend for beacon transmission. Reduction in beacon contention increases scalability of IBSS.	clock synchronization	S. S.

Many papers have shown that a path traversing more hops and/or carrying more loads is more probably blocked. However, we observed that, among all possible paths for a source-destination pair, it is very difficult to find a path which is both shortest and least loaded. Therefore, OHLC attempts to route a connection with a path that has an optimal compromise between its hopcount and actual offered load. Our proposed algorithm is time-efficient with the complexity of O(n 2 ), where n is number of network nodes. Simulation results (in a ring network, a fully connected network, and the NSFNET) show that OHLC can reduce call blocking probability by more than 22% to 78%, compared to the least-loaded routing algorithm.	algorithm;routing	Quang-Dzung Ho;Man-Seop Lee	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25969-5_68	time complexity;route;ring network;suurballe's algorithm;routing;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;yen's algorithm;link-state routing protocol;shortest path problem;k shortest path routing;shortest path faster algorithm;algorithm;telecommunications network;computer network	Theory	-3.0655511437340413	74.65388413136624	155430

We analytically prove that this extended scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery. Furthermore, we investigate schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network.	planar graph;routing	Adrian Loch;Hannes Frey;Matthias Hollick	2014	Pervasive and Mobile Computing	10.1016/j.pmcj.2013.03.004	wireless routing protocol;mathematical optimization;routing;static routing;zone routing protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	-0.6612699560725726	80.89009355916836	156591

In TDMA based broadcast schedule for these multihop networks, finding a collision free transmission schedule for every node in the network with minimum number of time slots and maximum slot usage is an NP-complete problem. Various heuristic approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. Among these, the Modified GA Approach by Chakraborty has used Genetic Algorithm for solving this problem by defining a new crossover operator that maintains only valid individuals in the population. But the crossover and mutation operators defined in that approach have less chances of maintaining diverse and fitter individuals in the population. In this paper, we enhance this Genetic algorithm by defining additional validity constraints whose application results in clearly observable optimizations in the individuals. Further, we define problem specific crossover and mutation operators that maintain these constraints while preserving diversity and fitness in the population. It is observed that the proposed Enhanced GA outperforms the existing heuristic approaches in almost all the test cases.	crossover (genetic algorithm);enhanced graphics adapter;genetic algorithm;heuristic;karp's 21 np-complete problems;np-completeness;network packet;observable;population;scheduling (computing);software release life cycle;test case	R.

0cd1f9bbc813f82ad4c06379a701e8a6f89bedf8	capacity-aware cost-efficient network reconstruction for post-disaster scenario		Natural disasters can result in severe damage to communication infrastructure, which leads to further chaos to the damaged area. After the disaster strikes, most of the victims would gather at the evacuation sites for food supplies and other necessities. Having a good communication network is very important to help the victims. In this paper, we aim at recovering the network from the still-alive mobile base stations to the out-of-service evacuation sites by using multi-hop relaying technique. We propose to reconstruct the post-disaster network in a capacity-aware way based on prize collecting Steiner tree. The purpose of the proposed scheme is to achieve high capacity connectivity ratio in a cost efficient way. To provide more accurate evaluation results, we evaluate the proposed scheme by using the real evacuation site and base station data in Tokyo area, and utilizing the big data analysis based post-disaster service availability model.	algorithm;big data;centralized computing;chaos theory;cost efficiency;disaster recovery;longest path problem;relay;routing;steiner tree problem;telecommunications network	Xiaoyan Wang;Hao Zhou;Lei Zhong;Yusheng Ji;Kiyoshi Takano;Shigeki Yamada;Guoliang Xue	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794910	simulation;telecommunications;operations research;computer security;computer network	Arch	2.7179006738447447	75.00383887866074	159197

By incorporating a theoretical model that can estimate BER changes hop-by-hop along lightpaths, the GA encodes the placements of 1R/2R/3R at intermediate regeneration sites as genes, and takes quality-of-transmission (QoT) and energy-efficiency as the fitness functions. With a relatively small population size (e.g. 30-50), the algorithms obtain multiple qualified MRP results that can satisfy both the QoT and energy requirements within 32 generations, for lightpaths with lengths up to 28 hops. Two crossover and two mutation operators are investigated within the GA. By adjusting the possibilities of the crossover and mutation intelligently, the adaptive scheme outperforms the uniform one by getting a larger percentage of fit individuals. We also propose two selection operators, and demonstrate an adjustable tradeoff between QoT and energy-efficiency.	computer simulation;crossover (genetic algorithm);fitness function;genetic algorithm;hop-by-hop transport;media redundancy protocol;numerical analysis;requirement;software release life cycle;x.690	Chuanqi Wan;Zuqing Zhu;Weida Zhong	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363777	simulation;genetic algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Visualization	-2.3726496740509107	81.31233569188423	159498

The distinguishing feature of a multimedia network is its ability to integrate different applications with different traffic characteristics and service requirements in the network, such as voice, video, and data. In order to meet their service requirements, it is necessary for the network to provide unique quality-of-service (QOS) guarantees to each application. QOS guarantees, specified as multiple end-to-end performance objectives, translate into path and link constraints in the shortest path routing problem. For a general cost function, shortest path routing subject to path constraints is known to be a nonpolynomial-(NP-) complete problem. The NBBS path selection algorithm, a heuristic solution based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm, has a polynomial order of complexity. The algorithm finds a minimum hop path satisfying an end-to-end delay (or delay variation) constraint, that in most cases also optimizes a load balancing function. To reduce the number of path constraints, other QOS requirements such as packet loss ratio are implemented as a link constraint. The notion of primary and secondary links is used to minimize the long-term overall call blocking probability by dynamically limiting the hop count of a given path. The path selection algorithm developed for point-to-point connections is described first, followed by its extension to the case of point-to-multipoint connections. P ath selection function is at the core of every routing protocol. In a packet-switching network , path selection determines the path each packet takes from the originating end station to its destination. Paths are selected to satisfy a constraint and to optimize some criteria. A routing protocol is designed around a path selection algorithm in which the type of information exchanged, how often it is exchanged, and how it is used depend on the path selection objectives. A survey of routing protocols used in communication networks is given in Reference 1; unconstrained path selection algorithms used in these routing protocols are discussed in Reference 2. All shortest path algorithms reported in the literature are variants of Dijk~tra,~ Bellman-F~rd,~ and Floyd-Warshall.' These algorithms have a polynomial time complexity and find a path in the network that optimizes a single criterion, such as cost or delay, or a scalar function of a number of criteria. Shortest path algorithms either can be implemented in a centralized location or may be distributed in the network.

The proposed approach uses summaries of content-based subscriptions to construct an event dissemination structure and Bloom filters are used to summarize subscriptions. We extend ODMRP (on-demand multicast routing protocol) to utilize this context from the middleware tier and construct an optimized dynamic dissemination mesh. ODMRP's mesh topology gives extra reliability compared to the tree structure in unstable mobile ad-hoc network environments.	bloom filter;control theory;hoc (programming language);mesh networking;middleware;multicast;multitier architecture;odmrp;routing;tree structure	Eiko Yoneki;Jean Bacon	2004	24th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2004.

The agents communicate and collaborate with each other and benefit from learning techniques, more specifically genetic algorithms. The proposed system consists of four types of agents, including regional, interface, cluster and query agents. The regional agent resides on the base-station and performs genetic algorithm intense computing. The interface agent interacts with the users to fulfil their interests. The cluster agents manage all agents within clusters for query dissemination and efficiency in network. The query agents reside in each sensor and acquire, aggregate, process the useful data, and transmit the desired results. A prototype of all agents is simulated. For a given radio model our test results revealed that our multi-agent-based approach for hierarchical routing not only outperforms other routing protocols such as LEACH, but also determines the set of optimum clusters for various topologies.	agent-based model;cluster analysis	Elhadi M.

In this paper this hypothesis is reviewed by quantifying the wavelength requirements in dynamic wavelength-routed optical networks and the comparison of these to those of the static approach. To do so, new analytical and heuristic lower bounds for the wavelength requirements in dynamic networks are proposed. They are used to evaluate the optimality of existing algorithms whose wavelength requirements are evaluated by means of simulation. Results show that dynamic wavelength-routed optical networks can save wavelengths only at low traffic loads (<0.4) and that the highest savings are achieved in sparsely physically connected networks.	routing	Alejandra Zapata;Polina Bayvel	2006		10.1007/11847366_49	telecommunications;computer science;wavelength;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;operations research;telecommunications network	Vision	-3.9707498415150684	75.72236015608293	162733

The multiple objects tracking application has a real-time characteristic, through which all packets should be delivered in as timely fashion as possible. The proposed framework consists of sink nodes, backbone nodes, mobile nodes and agent nodes. The location information of the mobile node is delivered to the sink node using both localization and routing techniques, which consider the network congestion. The proposed congestion reduction technique avoids network congestion by decreasing the number of transmitting packets based on the idea that network congestion occurs when the total data in transit is greater than the total channel capacity. The decrement is achieved by both merging and attachment operations, which consolidate several small packets into one large packet in intermediate backbone nodes. The mechanism also considers a time-constrained delivery to assure the user’s service request. The simulation is conducted using a TOSSIM simulator, and the result shows that the proposed mechanism improves performance in terms of the successful delivery ratio and the delay time.	network congestion;real-time transcription	Wonwoo Jung;Sujeong Shin;Sukwon Choi;Hojung Cha	2005		10.1007/11596042_121	embedded system;routing;network traffic control;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;mobile agent;tracking;packet loss;network congestion;ubiquitous computing;slow-start;sensor array;channel capacity;packet switching;computer network	Mobile	-2.471867203627021	76.59314018169408	162821

In the proposed scheme, location updates are based on the value of a movement counter. The update of the movement counter is based on information on the locations visited by a mobile terminal (MT) since the last location update. In particular, the cell identi®ers and the corresponding movement counter values are maintained in the MT for a part of the visited cells since the last location update. When the MT enters a cell whose identi®er is not stored in the MT, the movement counter increases by one. If the movement counter reaches the update threshold, a location update is triggered; otherwise, the cell identi®er and the corresponding movement counter value are stored in the MT. When the MT enters a cell whose identi®er is in the MT, the movement counter is assigned with the counter value kept in the MT for this cell, and all cells with greater counter values in the MT are removed. The proposed scheme allows the dynamic selection of the update threshold according to each user's calling and mobility patterns. Analytical and simulation models have been developed to compare the proposed scheme with both the movement-based scheme and the distance-based scheme. Results demonstrate that when the call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) is low, the proposed scheme can achieve a signi®cant cost reduction compared to the movement-based scheme. For example, when the CMR is 0.01, a savings of around 25% in the optimal total cost per call arrival is achieved with the proposed scheme.

Therefore, the SP routing problem in MANETs turns out to be a dynamic optimization problem. In this paper, we propose to use GAs with immigrants and memory schemes to solve the dynamic SP routing problem in MANETs. We consider MANETs as target systems because they represent new-generation wireless networks. The experimental results show that these immigrants and memory-based GAs can quickly adapt to environmental changes (i.e., the network topology changes) and produce high-quality solutions after each change.	artificial neural network;directed acyclic graph;dynamic programming;experiment;genetic algorithm;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;multicast;network topology;optimization problem;organizing (structure);particle swarm optimization;routing;self-organization;shortest path problem;simulation;software release life cycle	Shengxiang Yang;Hui Cheng;Fang Wang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)	10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2023676	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;genetic algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;machine learning;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;artificial neural network;computer network	Mobile	-0.5284868063237863	77.02100444296383	163554

It is based on organizing the nodes in a network into a logical hierarchy and maintaining a limited amount of state information at each node. It ensures that messages are not lost due to failures or partitions and minimizes redundancy. Furthermore, the protocol allows messages to be diffused while nodes are down provided the parent and child nodes of a failed node are alive. Moreover, the protocol allows nodes to be moved in the logical hierarchy and the network to be restructured dynamically in order to improve performance, while still ensuring that no messages are lost while the switch takes place and without disturbing normal operation. A performance study of the protocol in terms of availability and propagation delay indicates that the protocol reduces the delay by a factor of four compared to a protocol that does not diffuse messages past failed nodes.	aggregate data;algorithm;causal filter;communications protocol;disk partitioning;fault tolerance;human proteome project;internet protocol suite;local variable;logical topology;multicast;node (computer science);organizing (structure);overhead (computing);performance evaluation;propagation delay;quantum state;redundancy (engineering);scalability;software distribution;software propagation;the computer journal;tree (data structure);uml state machine;weak consistency	Akhil Kumar;Noha Adly	1998	Comput.

Paths of different homo-topy types can be used to improve load balancing and routing resilience. We propose the first lightweight homotopic routing scheme that generates constant bounded stretch compared to the shortest path of the same homotopy type. Our main insight is that in a sequence of triangles to traverse, a message always routed to the nearest point on the next triangle in the sequence travels at most a constant times the length of any shortest path going through the same sequence of triangles. Our routing scheme operates on two levels enabled by a coarse triangulation. The top level is used to specify and represent the requested homotopy type, while the bottom level executes the local greedy routing on a triangle sequence. After a preprocessing step that triangulates the given region and creates a minimum-size auxiliary structure, routing operates greedily at two different resolutions. We also present simulation analysis in a variety of settings and show that the paths indeed have small stretch in practice, considerably shorter than the bounds guaranteed by the theory.	greedy algorithm;load balancing (computing);preprocessor;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;traverse;thread (computing);triangulation (geometry)	Kan Huang;Chien-Chun Ni;Rik Sarkar;Jie Gao;Joseph S.

In this paper a mobile agent-based scheme for service discovery in ad hoc networks is introduced. Mobile agents are traveling through the network, collecting the dynamically changing service information. The travel route and the number of travel agents are adjusted according to the information state and the change of network topology. In a quantitative analysis the proposed algorithm is compared with the flooding scheme. The usefulness of the approach is proved by an implementation for mobile devices using J2ME and Bluetooth.	agent-based model;algorithm;bluetooth;hoc (programming language);java platform, micro edition;mobile agent;mobile device;network topology;numerical analysis;routing;service discovery;state (computer science);upwind scheme	R.

To maximize the lifetime of mobile networks, the power consumption rate of each node must be evenly distributed. This objective alone cannot be satisfied by the use of routing algorithms proposed in previous work. In this paper a new route selection mechanism for MANET routing protocol, called as Self Organizing Routing (SOR). Self Organized Routing (SOR) algorithm is devised to enable high-energy nodes to participate in routing of data packets using a virtual backbone. Hence the lifetime and stability of the network is increased as nodes having high energy are involved in routing of packets. Based on the simulation results obtained using GloMoSim (simulator), it is observed that SOR algorithm increase the lifetime of mobile ad hoc networks and validate the environment suitable for the various techniques.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);routing	K.

The integration of MANETs and the internet extends network coverage and facilitates hybrid wired and wireless networking. Most earlier approaches, for integrating MANETs with the internet considered fixed gateways and registration by means of a single gateway or Foreign Agent (FA) with unidirectional connectivity. In this paper, we propose an architecture for integrating MANETs and the internet using multiple Mobile Gateways (MGs) and FAs. MGs move within a one-hop or two-hop distance from the FAs. We extended the Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol and Mobile IP (MIP) to achieve the integration. The simulation results show that the use of multiple MGs and a hybrid gate discovery mechanism enhances network performance while providing bi-directional internet connectivity in a multiple foreign agent environment.	autonomous robot;feedback arc set;hoc (programming language);internet access;mobile ip;network performance;routing;simulation	Mieso K.

A hexagonal cellular structure is overlaid on the MANET and then the actual demand for the number of slots in each cell is found out. We assume a 2-cell buffering in which the interference among different mobile nodes do not extend beyond cells more than distance 2 apart. Based on the instantaneous cell demands, we propose optimal slot assignment schemes for both homogeneous (all cells have the same demand) and non-homogeneous cell demands by a clever reuse of the time slots, without causing any interference. The proposed algorithms exploit the hexagonal symmetry of the cells requiring O(log logm+mD+n) time, where m is the number of mobile nodes in the ad hoc network, n and D being the number of cells and diameter of the cellular graph.	hoc (programming language)	Koushik Sinha	2005		10.1007/11603771_28	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;reuse;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-1.9124934055589369	76.18232164686555	169391

A unique virtual adapter is developed between different adapters and then an IP address is assigned to the virtual adapter. As a general rule, when both network adapters are available, the wired adapter is preferred due to its faster transmission speed than the wireless adapter. When wired communication via the wired adapter gets disconnected while in service, the disconnection of wired adapter is automatically detected and then wireless handoff occurs by mapping information on the wireless adapter to the virtual adapter. According to the proposed handoff mechanism, the session can be continued seamlessly even when handoff between wired and wireless network adapters occurs at lower level in a network application where both IP address and port number are used to maintain session. To evaluate the proposed handoff mechanism, actual experiments are performed for various internet applications such as FTP, HTTP, Telnet, and then their results are discussed.	coexist (image);seamless3d	Pyung Soo Kim;Hak Goo Lee;Eung Hyuk Lee	2005		10.1007/11557654_5	internet protocol;embedded system;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;network interface;wireless network;wired communication;computer network	Mobile	-3.346701941113261	76.7673569957921	169489

However, devising an energy-efficient, cost-effective and reliable communication strategy for WSNs requires tight collaboration of all of the sublayers, which introduces new technical challenges in the areas of data, network and power management. This paper proposes a cross-layer sleep-scheduling-based organizational approach, called Sense-Sleep Trees (SS-Trees), that aims to harmonize the various engineering issues and provides a method of increasing monitoring coverage and operational lifetime of mesh-based WSNs engaged in wide-area surveillance applications. An iterative algorithmic approach is suggested to determine the feasible SS-Tree structures to achieve such design goals. Based on the computed SS-Trees, optimal sleep schedules and traffic engineering measures can be devised to balance sensing requirements, network communication constraints, and energy efficiency. For channel access, a simple single-channel CSMA MAC with implicit acknowledgements (IACKs) is selected to complement SS-Tree implementation because of its flexibility and adaptability in face of the unique operational characteristics of WSNs.

The routing algorithm does not involve back tracking and uses fault-vectors. Each node in an n-star has a fault-vector of $\lfloor\frac{3(n-1)}{2}\rfloor$ bits. The kth bit of a node’s fault-vector is a measure of its routing ability to nodes which are at distance k from itself. The fault-vector of each node can easily be calculated through $\lfloor\frac{3(n-1)}{2}\rfloor$ rounds of information exchanges among neighbor nodes. For a given source destination pair (u,v), the routing algorithm finds a path of length d + h where d is the length of the shortest path between u and v in a fault-free star graph and h = 0, 2 or 4. The space requirement for storing the fault vector is O(n) in each node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm far outperforms the routing algorithm based on safety vectors [13].	routing	Rajib K.

In specific environment such as mobile networks, characterized by high variability and dynamicity of network conditions and performances, where nodes can join and leave the network dynamically, resources reliability and availability constitute a critical issue. To deal with this critical issue, we introduce a new concept and model called ”P4L” (four layers Peer-to-Peer model) which define a novel P2P architecture, aims to improve: fault-tolerance, selforganization and scalability, with limited complexity while providing a rapid convergence for the lookup algorithm. The cost of ”P4L” lookup is O( ∑ ln(ni)) where ni is the number of nodes on ring level i (with maximum of 256 nodes in each ring). ”P4L” is efficiently adapted to the context where nodes join and leave dynamically and frequently. Each node maintains routing information of 2∗O(ln(ni)), where ni is the number of nodes on one ring. Thus ”P4L” is well adapted for terminals with limited resources such as mobile terminals. ”P4L” is based on ring topology with each ring connecting ”neighbouring” nodes in terms of physical and logical position. When ”P4L” is combined with broadcast mechanism, the lookup process is significantly improved. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with Chord protocol, an extension is proposed to support IPv6.	algorithm;broadcast domain;distributed hash table;fault tolerance;file sharing;hash function;heart rate variability;identifier;information exchange;lookup table;mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;performance;ring network;routing;scalability;social peer-to-peer processes	Mourad Amad;Ahmed Meddahi	2006		10.1007/11876601_35	ring network;fault tolerance;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;semantics;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-2.751867695854099	76.35615901237767	172583

While a recently proposed distributed algorithm for this problem guarantees to obtain optimal solutions, we show that its high message complexity may prevent such contribution from being practically used in resource-constrained WSNs. In this paper, we proposed a new distributed suboptimal algorithm that achieves a good balance on the algorithm-optimality and message complexity. In particular, we prove that it has a linear-message complexity. The tradeoff between algorithm sub-optimality and message complexity is also studied by simulations.	distributed algorithm;experiment;heuristic;mathematical optimization;multicast;optimization problem;simulation	Song Guo;Minyi Guo;Victor C.

One way suggested for reprogramming is with the help of an UAV (Unmanned Ariel Vehicle). To reprogram a sensor network with the help of an UAV, one can either communicate the entire new program to one (or a few) sensor in the field, or let the UAV communicate parts of the code to a subset of sensor nodes on multiple channels at once. In the latter approach, the nodes need to communicate with each other to receive the remaining parts of the program. In this paper, we propose a protocol for such gossip between nodes. To better utilize the multi-channel resources and reduce contention, our protocol provides a multi-channel sender selection algorithm. This algorithm attempts to ensure that in any neighborhood, at any time, there is at most one sensor transmitting on a given frequency. Moreover, our sender selection algorithm is greedy in that it tries to select the sender that is expected to have the most impact for each channel. Our protocol also conserves energy by putting the nodes that are unlikely to contribute or receive data shortly to “sleep” state. Through simulation, we show that our protocol is faster and more energy efficient than the existing reprogramming approaches that assume that the new program is initially located only on a small set of nodes.	code segment;concurrency (computer science);greedy algorithm;microcom networking protocol;pipeline (computing);randomness;selection algorithm;sensor;simulation;tinyos;transmitter;unmanned aerial vehicle	Limin Wang;Sandeep S.

In conjunction with the chosen routing strategy, we propose a distributed logical topology based location service (LTLS) protocol and give a formal description and analysis of this protocol on the DASM model. The high dynamics of mobile ad hoc networks require routing strategies substantially different from those used in static communication networks. A strategy for such networks is geographic routing in which each network node can find its physical location via GPS or other navigation technologies. To send a packet, the sender needs to know the most recent physical location of the destination node. This location information is provided by a location service protocol. The LTLS protocol has short message delivery delay, requires small routing tables, uses relatively few administrative packets, and has very good fault tolerance properties. Our goal in defining the network layer protocol in terms of a DASM model is twofold. First, we feel that the mathematical modeling paradigm of distributed abstract state machines provides an ideal formal basis for constructing, analyzing, and validating abstract requirements specifications of mobile ad hoc network protocols. Second, we intend to utilize the resulting behavior model as a formal basis for developing executable specifications serving as a platform for experimental validation of key system attributes and exploration of alternative design choices.	hoc (programming language);location-based service	Uwe Glässer;Qian-Ping Gu	2005	Theor.

A predefined number of messages are to be routed in a capacitated network including a set of nodes that can be producers (sources) and/or consumers (destinations, decision makers) of information. A node might also be a simple relay. We assume that the same information might be provided by different sources. Each edge in the network is characterized by a capacity, a transmission delay and a cost. We propose a mathematical formulation of the MMCF as a biobjective optimization problem that minimizes the overall cost and delay. Network structural constraints are to be respected such as the capacity of the edges and the single path. We assume the non preemptiveness of the transmission. A solution of the proposed model provides for each request the assigned source node, the transmission path as well as the bandwidth allocated along the path. Multicast trees might be generated if the same source is assigned to send the same message to different destinations. An ant colony metaheuristic is proposed to solve the problem. This paper presents an empirical validation of the proposed approach.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;ant colony optimization algorithms;approximation;bandwidth (signal processing);bounce address;computation;experiment;flow network;iteration;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;multicast;np-hardness;network topology;nonlinear system;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;relay;routing;statistical model;traffic flow (computer networking)	Hela Masri;Saoussen Krichen;Adel Guitouni	2011	2011 4th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC 2011)	10.1109/WMNC.2011.6097256	mathematical optimization;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	-4.541010298896645	81.5458560435934	175779

From an application programmer's point of view, CAST makes it possible for operations to be executed at arbitrary locations in space, at prescribed times which may be in the future, and on remote hosts even when no end-to-end connected route exists between the initiator and target(s) of the operation. To accomplish this, CAST assumes that each host moves in space in accordance with a motion profile which is accurate but which at any given time extends into the future for a limited duration. These motion profiles are freely exchanged among hosts in the network through a gossiping protocol. Knowledge about the motion profiles of the other hosts in the network allows for source routing of operation requests and replies over disconnected routes. In this paper, we present the CAST model and its formalization. We also discuss the feasibility of realizing this model.

The lifetime of participating nodes affects the stability of the network. Recent MANET routing protocols are greedy on network lifetime because of battery power limitations. Although, these algorithms help to maintain the stability of the network, they are not as much cost effective as traditional existing routing algorithms. Our proposed method considers both the routing cost and network lifetime issues in route selection, which is a good compromise between these two conflicting interests. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme selects a path with less cost than a path in lifetime prediction based routing algorithms and results more stable network than cost-effective routing algorithms do.	routing	Md.

RICFFP is based on the concept of flexible forward probability (FFP) and reply info caching (RIC). According to FFP scheme, if a node that receives a service request does not have a matched service, it will forward the request with a variable probability less than 100%. Moreover, the forward probability decreases linearly as the service request forwarded further. By selecting a proper forward probability, the overhead of RICFFP can be greatly decreased at the expense of slight degradation in its performance. To improve RICFFP’s performance further, RIC is introduced. According to RIC, each node can cache the service information in a received reply packet. With the help of RIC, packets sent by all the nodes will be decreased further. The simulation using OPNET proves the efficiency of RICFFP.	cpu cache;cache (computing);elegant degradation;network packet;new general catalogue;overhead (computing);radiation pattern;service discovery;simulation	Zhen-guo Gao;Xiao-Zong Yang;Tian-yi Ma;Shaobin Cai	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30121-9_75	web service;wireless ad hoc network;cpu cache;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;distributed computing;service discovery;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing;information system	Mobile	-2.4434999894452294	76.44760114852315	178136

In this paper, we study the problem of determining a degree-bounded directed spanning tree of minimum average-latency in a complete graph where the inter-node latencies are used to determine a metric. In particular, we focus on measuring the effects on average latency when imposing depth constraints (i.e., bounds on hop count) on degree-bounded spanning trees. The general problem is a well known NP-hard problem, and several works have proposed approximate solutions which aim at minimizing either depth or latency. In this work, we present a new heuristic algorithm which improves upon previous solutions by considering both depth and latency and the tradeoffs between them. Our algorithms are shown to improve the theoretical worst-case approximation factors, and we demonstrate improvements under empirical evaluation. Our experiments examine and analyze several different topologies, including, low-dimensional random geometric networks, random transit-stub networks, and high- dimensional hypercube networks. We show how our solutions can be applied in the context of enabling multicasting support in locality aware peer-to-peer overlay networks.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;cluster analysis;experiment;file spanning;geometric networks;heuristic (computer science);interrupt latency;locality of reference;minimum spanning tree;multicast;np-hardness;network address translation;network topology;overlay network;peer-to-peer	Michael T.

The GLU scheme takes account of the cooperative ability of the Mobile Terminals(MTs) in next-generation mobile networks, thus employs an autonomic group formation method to report location update in groups. A Leader Mobile Terminal(LMT) is elected out of all Group Members(GMs) to perform the location update and administration tasks for the whole group. Not only the bandwidth is saved for the efficiency of group operation, but also the whole system energy consumption of location update is significantly reduced in respect that communication range is much shorter in group than to base station. A leader rotation algorithm based on a variable called prestige is also exploited to make it fair. Both analysis and simulation show that the GLU scheme greatly saves energy for MTs and with our leader rotation algorithm, fairness can be also achieved.

The implementation of a network into different levels or sub-layers improves the performance and reduces the investment against plain topologies. This paper tries to characterize important parameters on multilevel networks such as diameter, average distance and gateway location to be able to optimize the global network topology with no need for additional path calculations.

Thus, the message ferrying (MF) scheme has been proposed as a strategy for providing connectivity in disruption tolerant network (DTN)s, where a set of nodes called ferries are responsible for carrying messages for all nodes in the networks. In such store-and-forward networks, buffers at ferry and regular nodes become critical resources and need to be allocated fairly among different users. In this paper, we propose a max-min fairness model for a DTN with a message ferry. Based on this model, we propose a buffer allocation scheme that can achieve fairness among different sessions. We also design an integrated buffer and routing management scheme called buffer efficient routing scheme (BERS). Via simulations, we demonstrate that our fair buffer allocation scheme assigns buffers fairly to different sessions. Our simulation studies also show that BERS can achieve higher session throughput and lower packet delivery latency than the only-store-and-forward routing scheme that is typically used in a message ferry system	delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);max-min fairness;maxima and minima;network packet;routing;scheme;simulation;store and forward;throughput	Mooi Choo Chuah;Wenbin Ma	2006	MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference		wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;engineering design process;computer network	Mobile	-3.7936090134621288	76.12009830392908	182897

The network formation of the IEEE 802.15.4 does not impose constraints on the topology. The Zigbee alliance uses the IEEE 802.15.4 layers to build a complete protocol stack for the implementation of wireless sensor networks. ZigBee specifies the network layer for star, tree and peer-to-peer topologies. Starting from these, more complex cluster-tree topologies can be formed. To control the network topology ZigBee fixes the maximum number of routers and end-devices that each router may have as children and also fixes the maximum depth of the tree. To better understand the importance of these constraints we simulate and analyze the IEEE 802.15.4 formation procedure in different network settings (single-sink and multi- sink scenarios). The goal is to provide guidelines for the practical implementation of ZigBee network formation with the aforementioned constraints.	network formation;network topology;peer-to-peer;protocol stack;requirement;router (computing);routing;selection rule;self-organization;simulation;telecommunications network;tree (data structure);xerox star	Francesca Cuomo;Sara Della Luna;Petia Todorova;Tapio Suihko	2008	2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)	10.1109/PERCOM.2008.26	ieee 802.11s;logical link control;service set;network allocation vector;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;computer science;wireless network;virtual lan;distributed computing;spanning tree protocol;computer network;logical topology;ieee 802.1q	Embedded	-0.5882800668924281	81.0281541623817	184195

In this paper, we propose DMAC, an energy efficient and low latency MAC that is designed and optimized for such data gathering trees in wireless sensor networks. We first show that previously proposed MAC protocols for sensor networks that utilize activation/sleep duty cycles suffer from a data forwarding interruption problem, whereby not all nodes on a multihop path to the sink can be notified of data delivery in progress, resulting in significant sleep delay. DMAC is designed to solve the interruption problem, by giving the active/sleep schedule of a node an offset that depends upon its depth on the tree. This scheme allows continuous packet forwarding because all nodes on the multihop path can be notified of the data delivery in progress. DMAC also adjusts node duty cycles adaptively according to the traffic load in the network by varying the number of active slots in an schedule interval. We further propose a data prediction mechanism and the use of more to send (MTS) packets in order to alleviate problems pertaining to channel contention and collisions. Our simulation results as well as experimental results with the Mote platform show that by exploiting the applicationspecific structure of data gathering trees in sensor networks, DMAC provides significant energy savings and latency reduction while ensuring high data reliability.

However, broadcasting monopolizes the medium, precluding clients from performing any other communication. We address this problem in two ways. First, we segment the server broadcast, with intervening periods of silence, during which the wireless devices may communicate. Second, we reduce the average access delay for clients using a novel cooperative caching scheme. Our scheme is fully decentralized, and uses information available locally at the client. Our results show that our model prevents the server from monopolizing the medium, and that our caching strategy reduces client access delays significantly.	distributed cache	Anup Mayank;Chinya V.

8e0e39a613bd98c09b933e5361aac5912c65dd37	an improved virtualization layer to support distribution of multimedia contents in pervasive social applications	virtualization;mobile ad hoc networks;pervasive social computing	Pervasive social computing is a new paradigm of computer science that aims to facilitate the realization of activities in whichever context, with the aid of information devices and considering social relations between users. This vision requires means to support the shared experiences by harnessing the communication and computing capabilities of the connected devices, relying on direct or hop-by-hop communications among people who happen to be close to each other. In this paper, we present an approach to turn mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) into stable communication environments for pervasive social applications. The proposal is based on an evolution of the VNLayer, a virtualization layer that defined procedures for mobile devices to collaboratively emulate an infrastructure of stationary virtual nodes. We refine the VNLayer procedures and introduce new ones to increase the reliability and the responsiveness of the virtual nodes, which serves to boost the performance of routing with a virtualized version of the well-known AODV algorithm. We prove the advantages of the resulting routing scheme by means of simulation experiments and measurements on a real deployment of an application for immersive and collective learning about History in museums and their surroundings. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to define a routing policy that assigns a continuous path to each origin-destination pair while minimizing the traffic, or load, passing through any single point. While the average load is minimized by straight-line routing, such a routing policy distributes the load nonuniformly, resulting in higher load near the center of the region. We consider one-turn rectilinear routing policies that divert traffic away from regions of heavier load, resulting in up to a 33% reduction in the maximum load while simultaneously increasing the path lengths by an average of less than 28%. Our policies are simple to implement, being both local and oblivious. We provide a lower bound that shows that no one-turn rectilinear routing policy can reduce the maximum load by more than 39% and we give a polynomial-time procedure for approximating the optimal randomized policy.	approximation algorithm;load balancing (computing);polynomial;randomized algorithm;regular grid;routing;time complexity	Stephane Durocher;Evangelos Kranakis;Danny Krizanc;Lata Narayanan	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-79228-4_41	time complexity;mathematical optimization;static routing;real-time computing;dsrflow;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;mathematics;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;path vector protocol;algorithm;routing information protocol	Theory	-2.5556156297495782	79.77772733674396	186430

The prototype of Anysee has been widely used in CERNET. Logging traces obtained from broadcasting 2004 Athens Olympic Games over 16 days have shown that the performance of Anysee, such as end-to-end delay and absolute data delivery delay, significantly outperforms that of randomly constructed overlay multicast.	end-to-end principle;locality of reference;multicast;overlay network;prototype;randomness;software deployment;streaming media;tracing (software);tree (data structure)	Xuping Tu;Hai Jin;Dafu Deng;Chao Zhang;Quan Yuan	2005		10.1007/11577188_15	multicast;overlay network;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Networks	-2.868368746059569	76.18366240197342	187438

An ad hoc network differs from cellular networks in that there is no wired infrastructure and the communication capabilities of the network are limited by the battery power of the network nodes. One of the original motivations for ad hoc networks is found in military applications. A classic example of ad hoc networking is network of war fighters and their mobile platforms in battlefields. Indeed, a wealth of early research in the area involved the development of packet-radio networks (PRNs) and survivable radio networks [16]. While military applications still dominate the research needs in ad hoc networking, the recent rapid advent of mobile telephony and plethora of personal digital assistants has brought to the fore a number of potential commercial applications of ad hoc networks. Examples are disaster relief, conferencing, home networking, sensor networks, personal area networks, and embedded computing applications [37].The lack of a fixed infrastructure in ad hoc networks implies that any computation on the network needs to be carried out in a decentralized manner. Thus, many of the important problems in ad hoc networking can be formulated as problems in distributed computing. However, there are certain characteristics of ad hoc networks that makes this study somewhat different than traditional work in distributed computing. In this article, we review some of the characteristic features of ad hoc networks, formulate problems and survey research work done in the area. We focus on two basic problem domains: topology control, the problem of computing and maintaining a connected topology among the network nodes, and routing. This article is not intended to be a comprehensive survey on ad hoc networking. The choice of the problems discussed in this article are somewhat biased by the research interests of the author.The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe various aspects relevant to modeling ad hoc networks. In Section 3, we discuss topology control. Since the nodes of an ad hoc network are often associated with points in 2-dimensional space, topology control is closely tied to computational geometry; we will briefly review this relationship and extant work in the area. In Section 4, we discuss routing protocols for ad hoc networks. After a brief overview of the many protocols that have been proposed, we discuss alternative approaches based on the adversarial network model.	computation;computational geometry;distributed computing;embedded system;hoc (programming language);mobile device;network model;network packet;personal digital assistant;problem domain;routing;semantic network;software-defined networking;topology control	Rajmohan Rajaraman	2002	SIGACT News	10.1145/564585.564602	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;survey research;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;dynamic circuit network;computational geometry;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-0.9805238699245028	81.12807618076641	187564

The APs are configured to operate on one of multiple available channels. Mobile hosts and wireless routers can select their operating channels dynamically through channel switching. In this environment, we propose a routing protocol that finds routes to balance load among channels while maintaining connectivity. The protocol works with nodes equipped with a single network interface, which distinguishes our work with other multichannel routing protocols that require multiple interfaces per node. The protocol discovers multiple routes to multiple APs, possibly operating on different channels. Based on traffic load information, each node selects the """"best"""" route to an AP and synchronizes its channel with the AP. With this behavior, the channel load is balanced, removing hot spots and improving channel utilization. The protocol assures that every node has at least one route to an AP, where all intermediate nodes are operating on the same channel. Our simulation results show that the proposed protocol successfully adapts to changing traffic conditions and improves performance over a single-channel protocol and a multichannel protocol with no load balancing"""	load balancing (computing);network interface;routing;simulation;throughput;wireless access point;wireless router	Jungmin So;Nitin H.

Such high-quality service demands substantial network resources. As these applications grow in use, scalability becomes an important issue. One way to achieve scalability is through clustering. The overall load is distributed among clusters so that large multicast groups avoid overloading the network. We propose a protocol for reliable multicasting, based on a cluster structure. We prove that in the cluster, the leader is an ancestor of all cluster members with respect to the multicast routing tree. This relationship yields an efficient acknowledgement structure. We also describe an acknowledgement algorithm based on a pulsing mechanism and prove that it has constant latency for acknowledging data. Finally, we show that the protocol is scalable by proving that it generates a constant load for all nodes.	multicast	Lenka Carr-Motycková;David A.

ff0e4275e94d310ff479aa3d188711fbc35e48cd	interaction based routing algorithm for opportunistic mobile social networks		Opportunistic Mobile Social Networks (MSNs) are a type of delay-tolerant networks that are composed of mobile nodes with social characteristics. Most of current research on forwarding algorithms for MSNs leverages the properties of social networks, such as community and centrality. However, the fundamental property, interaction, has not received sufficient attention. The effects of interactions consist of two parts: direct effects and indirect effects. Most existing work based on interactions takes only direct effects into consideration. We propose a distributed Interaction Based Routing (IBR) algorithm. Our main contribution is a distributed method to compute the popularity of nodes by using the direct and indirect effects of interactions. We compare IBR with Epidemic, Prophet, and BubbleRap under three different scenarios. The results show that IBR improves the forwarding efficiency significantly and independent of the network scenarios.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);centrality;computation;image-based modeling and rendering;interaction;opportunistic mobile social network;routing	Ying Li;Radim Bartos	2017	2017 14th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983157	distributed algorithm;computer network;distributed computing;computer science;centrality;social network;mobile computing;mobile telephony;algorithm;popularity	HCI	0.5962311797522032	78.8108719059246	190001

In content-based routing, messages are forwarded based on queries on their content that clients and routers establish beforehand. In this paper, we examine the cost and safety of handoff protocols for subscribers and publishers in content-based routing networks. We examine two useful properties for mobility-aware content-based routing systems, namely completeness and mobility-safety. Then we determine the upper and lower bound handoff costs for three interesting topologies, a number of optimizations, and show that if completeness cannot be assumed the signalling cost is considerably higher and flooding needs to be used. We present simulation results for subscriber mobility and mobility-safety proofs for the investigated protocols. Both theoretical and experimental results show that rendezvous points may be used to significantly reduce the signalling cost of handoffs.	routing	Sasu Tarkoma;Jaakko Kangasharju	2007	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2006.07.016	policy-based routing;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;zone routing protocol;content analysis;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;upper and lower bounds;computer security;computer network	Arch	-2.0613757502899173	77.00529095805659	190171

The aim is to provide multiple communication services (voice, data, video, etc.) over a specific area. The network must be deployed quickly for a relatively short period (emergency situations, sporting events, etc.), in the case of cellular network overload or blackout. A Flying Ad-Hoc Network will be deployed to cover all the potential users.	algorithm;depletion region;optimized link state routing protocol;telecommunications network;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	Dorin Rautu;Riadh Dhaou;Emmanuel Chaput	2017	2017 13th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986367	optimized link state routing protocol;handover;telecommunications network;computer network;distributed computing;computer science;cellular network;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	2.646477605091932	75.23271461392234	191604

These protocols assume that the mobility parameters of the network are fixed, and so they cannot perform well under real MANET scenarios in which the mobility parameters of the hosts vary over time at random. Finding the optimal solution to the multicast routing problem is incredibly hard, if the mobility parameters are assumed to be random variables. This becomes more difficult when the probability distribution function of these random variables is assumed to be unknown. In this paper, we propose a weighted multicast routing algorithm for MANET in which the mobility parameters are supposed to be random variables with unknown distribution. In this method, the multicast routing problem is first transformed into an equivalent stochastic Steiner tree problem in which the random weight associated with a communication link is its expected duration time. Then, a learning automata-based algorithm is proposed for solving the proxy Steiner tree problem. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to find the most stable multicast route (with the maximum duration) against the host mobility. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed method over the best existing mobility-based multicast routing protocols in terms of the packet delivery ratio, multicast route lifetime, control message overhead, and end-to-end delay.	hoc (programming language);multicast;routing	Javad Akbari Torkestani;Mohammad Reza Meybodi	2011	J.

Therefore context-aware communication is considered to be vital for inducing inter-vehicular intelligence between groups of vehicles with similar interests. However, traditional network addressing schemes are not well suited for group-based communication in large scale vehicular networks. The classical network paradigms of multicasting and broadcasting to define groups are too limited. First, there is no way to optimize network traffic based on the contextual characteristics of the nodes. Second, the groups of nodes are highly dynamic with vehicles randomly joining and leaving multiple groups. We propose an information dissemination approach based on context grouping in which only relevant information is shared among nodes. We evaluate our approach in a large scale vehicular network where groups are formed based on the location and shared interests of the nodes. The experiments show that by inducing our context-based grouping mechanism we can significantly eliminate irrelevant information and reduce overall network traffic in a scalable way.	apollonian network;embedded system;experiment;inductive reasoning;multicast;network traffic control;node (computer science);optimizing compiler;peer-to-peer;randomness;relevance;scalability	Ansar-Ul-Haque Yasar;Yves Vanrompay;Davy Preuveneers;Yolande Berbers	2010	13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625104	computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer network	Mobile	2.6911918962534425	80.20487724970307	192677

With technological advances, a large number of sensors can be deployed for multitarget tracking purposes. However, due to physical limitations such as frequency, power, bandwidth, and fusion center capacity, only a limited number of them can be used by each LFC. The transmission power of future sensors is anticipated to be software controllable within certain lower and upper limits. Thus, the frequency reusability and the sensor reachability can be improved by controlling transmission powers. Then, the problem is to select the sensor subsets that should be used by each LFC and to find their transmission frequencies and powers in order to maximize the tracking accuracies and minimize the total power consumption. The frequency channel limitation and the advantage of variable transmitting power have not been discussed in the literature. In this paper, the optimal formulation for the aforementioned sensor management problem is provided based on the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound. Finding the optimal solution to the aforementioned NP-hard multiobjective mixed-integer optimization problem in real time is difficult in large-scale scenarios. An algorithm is presented to find a suboptimal solution in real time by decomposing the original problem into subproblems, which are easier to solve, without using simplistic clustering algorithms that are typically used. Simulation results illustrating the performance of sensor array manager are also presented.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);channel (communications);cluster analysis;distributed computing;feedback;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;reachability;sensor;simulation;transmitter	Ratnasingham Tharmarasa;Thia Kirubarajan;Jiming Peng;Thomas Lang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)	10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2022175	mathematical optimization;integer programming;computer science;artificial intelligence;resource management;control theory;mathematics;sensor fusion;upper and lower bounds	Mobile	-0.10407830348362385	74.79156498192236	193104

Each node acts as an end node as well as a router for other nodes. There are generally two types of ad hoc routing protocols, reactive and proactive routing protocols. The focus of this paper centers on reactive routing protocols which establish routes between communicating nodes when needed using a route discovery process involving Route Requests and Route Replies, a process which can be easily misused for denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we will describe one such attack, the Route Request Flooding Attack (RRFA) targeted at reactive routing protocols used in mobile ad hoc networks. Then, we propose the Route Request Flooding Defence (RRFD) mechanism that is designed to reduce the impact of RRFA. Finally, we present simulation results to show the detrimental effects of RRFA and the effectiveness of RRFD.	breadth-first search;denial-of-service attack;hoc (programming language);malware;mobile phone;requests;router (computing);routing;scalability;simulation;unreachable memory	Zhi Ang Eu;Winston Khoon Guan Seah	2006		10.1007/11919568_33	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;route poisoning;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;split horizon route advertisement;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-1.930355652792595	76.38575339564454	193646

For some application scenarios, reliable data dissemination to all nodes is necessary for propagating code updates, queries, and other sensitive information in wireless sensor networks. Epidemic algorithms are a natural approach for reliable distribution of information in such ad hoc, decentralized, and dynamic environments. In this paper we show the applicability of epidemic algorithms in the context of wireless sensor environments, and provide a comparative performance analysis of the three variants of epidemic algorithms in terms of message delivery rate, average message latency, and messaging overhead on the network. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a novel precomputation approach to multi-constrained intra-domain QoS routing (PMCP). It is assumed that a router maintains the link state information of the entire domain. PMCP cares each QoS weight to several degrees, and computes a number of QoS coefficients uniformly distributed in the multi-dimensional QoS metric space. Based on each coefficient, a linear QoS function is constructed to convert the multiple QoS metrics to a single QoS value. We then create a shortest path tree with respect to the QoS value by Dijkstra's algorithm. Finally, according to the multiple coefficients, different shortest path trees are calculated to compose the QoS routing table. We analyze linear QoS functions in the QoS metric space, and give a mathematical model to determine the feasibility of a QoS request in the space. After PMCP is introduced, we analyze its computational complexity and present a method of QoS routing table lookup. Extensive simulations evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and present a comparative study.	precomputation;quality of service;routing	Yong Cui;Jianping Wu;Ke Xu	2005	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2004.11.002	feasibility study;mathematical optimization;routing;np-complete;lookup table;metric space;computer science;theoretical computer science;comparative research;precomputation;mathematical model;shortest path problem;computational complexity theory;service quality;algorithm;shortest-path tree	Theory	-4.033740909824027	77.95962233867493	193902

An ad hoc on-demand position-based private routing algorithm, called AO2P, is proposed for communication anonymity. Only the position of the destination is exposed in the network for route discovery. To discover routes with the limited routing information, a receiver contention scheme is designed for determining the next hop. Pseudo identifiers are used for data packet delivery after a route is established. Real identities (IDs) for the source nodes, the destination nodes, and the forwarding nodes in the end-to-end connections are kept private. Anonymity for a destination relies on the difficulty of matching a geographic position to a real node ID. This can be enforced by the use of secure position service systems. Node mobility enhances destination anonymity by making the match of a node ID with a position momentary. To further improve destination privacy, R-AO2P is proposed. In this protocol, the position of a reference point, instead of the position of the destination, is used for route discovery. Analytical models are developed for evaluating the delay in route discovery and the probability of route discovery failure. A simulator based on ns-2 is developed for evaluating network throughput. Analysis and simulation results show that, while AO2P preserves communication privacy in ad hoc networks, its routing performance is comparable with other position-based routing algorithms.	algorithm;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;entropy (information theory);geographic routing;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);identifier;information exchange;network packet;privacy;simulation;throughput	Xiaoxin Wu;Bharat K.

We model the minimum-energy cooperative path (MECP) problem and prove that this problem is NP-complete. We hence design an approximation algorithm called cooperative shortest path (CSP) algorithm that uses Dijkstra's algorithm as the basic building block and utilizes cooperative transmissions in the relaxation procedure. Compared with traditional non-cooperative shortest path algorithms, the CSP algorithm can achieve a higher energy saving and better balanced energy consumption among network nodes, especially when the network is in large scale. The nice features lead to a unique, scalable routing scheme that changes the high network density from the curse of congestion to the blessing of cooperative transmissions.	approximation algorithm;dijkstra's algorithm;fairness measure;heuristic;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;np-completeness;network congestion;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem	Fulu Li;Kui Wu;Andrew Lippman	2008	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2008.6389840	private network-to-network interface;wireless ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;suurballe's algorithm;routing;scalability;np-complete;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;yen's algorithm;relaxation;mathematics;distributed computing;efficient energy use;link-state routing protocol;node;shortest path problem;k shortest path routing;shortest path faster algorithm;algorithm;computer network	Mobile	-1.8761922658977737	75.31197259653594	195253

In addition, we have derived several properties of the proposed algorithm. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm has good efficiency for small network with light traffic. Our proposed algorithm can be applied to find multicast loops for real-time multimedia traffic distribution.	algorithm;dynamic programming;experiment;heuristic (computer science);loss function;matching (graph theory);multicast;optimization problem;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Yong-Jin Lee;Mohammed Atiquzzaman	2005		10.1007/11596356_109	suurballe's algorithm;real-time computing;multicast;simulation;systems modeling;human–computer interaction;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;ubiquitous computing;algorithm;satisfiability	Metrics	-3.921443419772548	77.88335507451907	196743

The Mobile IP protocol provides a basic solution to mobility management in future all-IP wireless network environments. However, Mobile IP suffers from several problems such as triangular routing, long distant and frequent registration update. In this paper, we propose to use the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network technology to improve Mobile IP. We organize home agents into P2P networks, and take addressing binding data as shard data. A user’s address binding will be hashed into the P2P network and can be queried using P2P lookup mechanisms. We can use a key value (e.g., email or IP address, telephone number) in the P2P lookup, to uniquely locate a user’s address binding. The potential characteristics of load balancing and fault tolerance in a P2P network make our approach more scalable and robust than the standard Mobile IP. To reduce the registration update cost, we chose a dynamic home agent for each mobile user that is close to the user’s location. We study the performance of our proposed approach both qualitatively and quantitatively.	aaa (video game industry);attribute–value pair;authentication;authorization;directory service;electronic billing;email;fault tolerance;hash function;hidden line removal;internet;list of code lyoko episodes;load balancing (computing);lookup table;mobile ip;mobile phone;multicast;peer-to-peer;radius;scalability;server (computing);shard (database architecture);similarity search;telephone number;triangular routing	Shou-Chih Lo	2007	J.

In this paper, we propose a mesh-based anycast routing algorithm (MARP) for ad hoc networks. The proposed routing model is robust and reliable, which can solve the unsteady topology problem in ad hoc networks. The future work is discussed at the end of this paper.	anycast;routing	Shui Yu;Wanlei Zhou	2005		10.1007/11576235_92	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	-2.2591062896883978	76.20661166221178	197966

This work presents a dynamic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve the coverage and connectivity dynamic problems (CCDP) in flat WSNs. The model solution provides a node scheduling scheme indicating the network topology in pre-defined time periods. The objective consists of assuring the coverage area and network connectivity at each period minimizing the energy consumption. The model tests use the optimization commercial package CPLEX 7.0. The results show that the proposed node scheduling scheme allows the network operation during all the defined periods guaranteeing the best possible coverage, and can extend the network lifetime besides the horizon of time.	algorithm;cplex;computation;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;network topology;reactive planning;requirement;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor node	Fabíola Guerra Nakamura;Frederico Paiva Quintão;Gustavo Campos Menezes;Geraldo Robson Mateus	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31956-6_56	embedded system;systems modeling;wireless sensor network;integer programming;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;dynamic programming;linear model;scheduling;sensor array;network topology;computer network	Embedded	-0.405008217577843	75.22358998826975	198838
afbac8d09dbc43c03cc42e5c89ff933dfa2522eb	a noisy chaotic neural network approach to topological optimization of a communication network with reliability constraints	system reliability;network design;combinatorial problems;optimization problem;community networks;chaotic neural network	Network topological optimization in communication network is to find the topological layout of network links with the minimal cost under the constraint that all-terminal reliability of network is not less than a given level of system reliability. The all-terminal reliability is defined as the probability that every pair of nodes in the network can communicate with each other. The topological optimization problem is an NP-hard combinatorial problem. In this paper, a noisy chaotic neural network model is adopted to solve the all-terminal network design problem when considering cost and reliability. Two sets of problems are tested and the results show better performance compared to previous methods, especially when the network size is large.	artificial neural network;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network model;network planning and design;optimization problem;telecommunications network;terminal emulator	Lipo Wang;Haixiang Shi	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-28648-6_36	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;fuzzy transportation;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;network simulation;network topology	DB	-3.9803654214643607	80.2800604101431	199308

An essential factor of these real-time application is to optimize the Delay- and delay Variation-Bounded Multicast Tree (DVBMT) problem. This problem is to satisfy the minimum delay variation and the end-to-end delay within an upper bound. The DVBMT problem is known as NP-complete problem. The representative algorithms for the problem are DVMA, DDVCA, and so on. In this paper, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms any other algorithm. The efficiency of our algorithm is verified through the performance evaluation and the enhancement is up to about 13.5% in terms of the multicast delay variation. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(mn 2 ) which is comparable to well known DDVCA.	multicast	Moonseong Kim;Young-Cheol Bang;Hyung-Jin Lim;Hyunseung Choo	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.9.2385	time complexity;routing;real-time computing;multicast;np-complete;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;elmore delay;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;service quality;network delay;computer network;satisfiability	EDA	-3.4292979200337297	78.02660211164627	199388
