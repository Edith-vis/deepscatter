Without requiring a priori probability of target presence, the fusion threshold bounds derived using Chebyshev's inequality ensure a higher hit rate and lower false alarm rate compared to the weighted averages of individual sensors. The Monte Carlo-based simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves target detection performance, and can also be used to guide the actual threshold selection in practical sensor network implementation under certain error rate constraints.	chebyshev polynomials;monte carlo method;sensor;simulation;social inequality	Mengxia Zhu;Song Ding;Chase Qishi Wu;Richard R.

However, WPDM suffers from severe performance degradation in the presence of high-power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities. In this paper, data predistortion using the pth-order Volterra inverse is proposed to combat the amplifier nonlinearities in a WPDM system. A 5th-order Volterra inverse with truncated memory length is designed based on the Volterra series channel model. Computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique in compensating amplifier nonlinearities even under system parameter discrepancy. Guidelines are also proposed for designing wavelet filter which leads to better predistortion with the truncated Volterra inverse.	audio power amplifier;basis function;channel (communications);discrepancy function;division by zero;elegant degradation;multiplexing;network packet;simulation;waveform;wavelet	Kin-Fai To;Pak-Chung Ching;Kon Max Wong	2001		10.1109/ICASSP.2001.940551	computer simulation;nonlinear distortion;transform coding;digital filter;degradation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;packet switching;wavelength-division multiplexing;robustness;wavelet transform	Networks	47.38792589808147	82.39321790000626	145914

To improve the accuracy of feature based AMC, a novel multi-cumulant based modulation classification scheme using uniform linear array is proposed in this paper. Moreover, two methods are formulated to combine the signal from different antenna branches, i.e., DOAC (Direction of arrival estimation based Combination) and CC (Cooperative Combination). With an estimate of the incident angle of the signal, DOAC combines signals from different branches using maximum ratio combining. CC calculates the feature value of each branch independently and utilizes the average feature value of all branches for classification. Simulation results prove that using multiple cumulants yields performance gain over traditional methods using a single cumulant. Moreover, the influence of antenna number and sample length on performance is also explored.	advanced mezzanine card;cellular automaton;charge-coupled device;computational complexity theory;direction of arrival;modulation;resultant;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Sai Huang;Zhiyong Feng;Yifan Zhang;Kezhong Zhang;Wei Li	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7565131	speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;angle of arrival;antenna noise temperature;smart antenna;signal-to-noise ratio;sensor array;modulation	Mobile	53.32168841844644	82.70594469420142	147078

However, its performance may suffer from the noise uncertainty, which is portrayed by the SNR wall in some literatures. In this paper we analyze the spectrum sensing performance under noise uncertainty and propose a new approach to obtain the SNR wall. In addition, a suboptimal liner cooperative sensing algorithm with wavelet denoising is proposed to reduce the impact of noise uncertainty. Analysis and numberical results show that cooperative sensing and wavelet denoising can significantly improve the sensing performance under noise uncertainty condition.	algorithm;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;elegant degradation;noise reduction;numerical analysis;performance;poisson wavelet;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;the wall street journal	Haijun Wang;Yi Xu;Xin Su;Jing Wang	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5494009	spectrum;cognitive radio;electronic engineering;speech recognition;uncertainty analysis;uncertainty;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;sensor;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelet transform	Mobile	50.577581628107	85.99692731374581	148134

In order to avoid interference to licensed users, spectrum sensing has emerged as an enabling technology for DSA. The requirements for spectrum sensors are stringent, as licensed user detection must be performed reliably at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Sensing performance can be improved by exploiting signal features not present in the background noise. These approaches result in tradeoffs among performance and robustness to departures from the signal model. We consider second-order signal features and develop detectors exploiting spatial (by using multiple antennas) as well as temporal signal correlation, taking advantage of the fact that the power spectrum of the primary signal at each antenna can be known up to a complex scalar representing the unknown propagation channel. A low-SNR Generalized Likelihood Ratio approach is adopted in order to overcome this uncertainty, resulting in different tests intimately related to familiar diversity combining techniques. The performance of the proposed detectors is analyzed and tested in different scenarios.	interference (communication);mimo;requirement;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;spectral density	Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar;Roberto López-Valcarce;Josep Sala-Alvarez	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.101211.110665	statistical hypothesis testing;telecommunications;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	49.47326747462877	85.39693552516819	148431

Although spectrum sensing can be performed by a single CR, it is shown in the literature that cooperative techniques, including multiple CRs/sensors, improve the performance and reliability of spectrum sensing. Existing cooperation techniques usually assume a static communication scenario between the unknown source and sensors along with a fixed propagation environment class. In this paper, an online adaptive cooperation scheme is proposed for spectrum sensing to maintain the level of sensing reliability and performance under changing channel and environmental conditions. Each cooperating sensor analyzes second-order statistics of the received signal, which undergoes both correlated fast and slow fading. Autocorrelation estimation data from sensors are fused together by an adaptive weighted linear combination at the fusion center. Weight update operation is performed online through the use of orthogonal projection onto convex sets. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is maintained for dynamically changing characteristics of the channel between an unknown source and sensors, even under different physical propagation environments. In addition, it is shown that the proposed cooperative scheme, which is based on second-order detectors, yields better results compared with the same fusion mechanism that is based on conventional energy detectors.	autocorrelation;cognitive radio;convex set;sensor;software propagation	Serhan Yarkan;B.

b2fcfe8b5e7e1b096f1d76f3ba5e92ba260b2211	a blind equalization algorithm for biological signals transmission	transmission;telemedicine;dse cma;biological signals	Direct transmission of biological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) through mobile network provides practically unlimited movement of the patients and unlimited coverage area. However, transmission of such signals over a bandlimited channel or through a multipath propagation is subject to inter symbol interference (ISI), whereby adjacent symbols on the output of the channel smear and overlap each other causing degradation of error performance. Mitigation of such kind of distortion can be achieved through equalization filter. Recently an adaptive blind channel equalization using sinusoidally-distributed dithered signed-error constant modulus algorithm (DSE-CMA) has been proposed. In this paper we investigate the performance and the feasibility of this scheme for wireless ECG and EEG transmission. Also, this paper discusses the importance of adaptive blind equalizer for biological signals transmission over existing wireless networks such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE). The geometrical-based hyperbolically distributed scatterers (GBHDS) channel model for macrocell environments was simulated with angular spreads (AS) taken from measurement data. Simulation results show that the low complexity of implementation and the fast convergence rate are the major advantages of deploying this scheme for telemedicine applications. It is also shown that the equalizer output signal is highly correlated with the original transmitted signal in time and joint time-frequency domains.	algorithm;blind equalization;cma-es;channel (communications);dither;electroencephalography;equalization (communications);modulus of continuity;rate of convergence	Seedahmed S.

A sequential setup, in which the cognitive users estimate available channels one by one, is considered. In addition, the channel estimation for each channel is also sequential. In particular, cognitive users will determine whether to finish the estimation process of the current channel and switch to next channel for estimation based on the training symbols received so far. To balance the tradeoff between the estimation error and time spent on the channel estimation, we aim to design a switch function and an estimator that minimize a linear combination of these two factors. We obtain the optimal solution for the general case. Numerical results are provided to show the substantial gain of our solution over that of uniformly allocating training time to each channel.	channel state information;cognitive radio;loss function;numerical method	Raied Caromi;Lifeng Lai	2012	2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2012.6310850	sequential estimation;cognitive radio;bayes estimator;telecommunications;computer science;sequential analysis;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	51.29636659142408	84.95191683256121	149783

Earlier works on centralized decision fusion show the half-voting and majority rules to be optimum in many spectrum sensing scenarios in terms of minimizing the decision error (or equivalently maximizing the probability of correct decision). We consider a commonly occurring case in spectrum sensing in which the detection probability of a cognitive radio enabled sensor node is greater than its false-alarm probability. For this case, we consider five scenarios and demonstrate that the proposed method either performs better than half-voting and majority rules or exhibits a comparable performance. In this context, we also establish a criterion to make a choice between the AND and OR rules and compute the optimum number of nodes participating in cooperative spectrum sensing for these rules to maximize the correct decision probability.	multistage amplifier	Kamlesh Gupta;S.

However, many of those channels that are detected to be free are adjacent to used channels, with possibly very large power levels. As a result, the true DSA problem is not only reliable detection of free bands, but also robust operation next to used bands. In this demo we demonstrate an SDR RFIC which is robust against out-of-band interference. This robustness is achieved by improving the linearity of the SDR receiver significantly. The need for robustness is demonstrated in real time by showing the received constellation diagram of an 802.11af-like OFDM signal in the presence of a large out-of-band interferer. The wanted and interfering signal are received simultaneously by two generations of SDR RFIC's, showing both the performance degradation caused by interference from adjacent bands and the improvement enabled by the robust receiver.	diagram;etsi satellite digital radio;elegant degradation;interference (communication);noise floor;out-of-band agreement;rfic	Peter Van Wesemael;Sofie Pollin;Mattias Desmet;Antoine Dejonghe	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks	10.1109/DYSPAN.2012.6478141	interference;adjacent-channel interference;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;co-channel interference;computer network	Arch	48.407977738173784	84.1038594393225	150967

The proposed technique has flexibility of filtering single or multiple sub-bands of a wide-band input signal, which is sparse in frequency domain, without increase in additional computational cost. The filter bandwidth can also be controlled by increasing the number of channels in sensing architecture. The simulation result shown in this paper includes sub-band filtering of a frequency domain sparse multi-band input signal with or without noise. BER performance of a BPSK modulated signal after filtering and demodulation using the proposed technique is also presented to analyze the impact of sub-band filtering.	algorithmic efficiency;dft matrix;modulation;multiply-with-carry;simulation;sparse matrix;the filter;x.690	Chandra Prakash;Vijay Kr.

In order to concretize this concept, several uniform cooperative spectrum sensing techniques have been proposed in literature which suffers from a high complexity computation over the global sensing scheme. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a robust and efficient spectrum sensing technique. The proposal investigates a new alternative of Single-Pixel-Camera adaptation of the cooperative multiband spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio. Instead of using the conventional uniform band measurements, we investigate a non-uniform approach, where the time of sensing is reduced by using a hard and soft decision metric. Moreover, this approach allows to enhance the performances in terms of spectrum sensing. Simulation results are given to support our claims.	cognitive radio;computation;cyclostationary process;next-generation network;performance;pixel;programming paradigm;robustness (computer science);simulation;throughput	Mouna Sghaier;Fatma Abdelkefi;Mohamed Siala;Mohamed Ibnkahla	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146088	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications	Mobile	50.79906117745707	85.93895042503372	151580

9243115fbb5b6ff8f2cc9cfa2e882ea2bd8bad00	performance analysis of locally most powerful invariant test for sphericity of gaussian vectors in coherent mimo radar		Locally most powerful invariant test (LMPIT) for sphericity of Gaussian vectors has been derived by Ramírez et al. Nevertheless, the decision threshold of the LMPIT is not accurate and its detection performance has not yet been addressed. In this paper, the LMPIT is performed for target detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, and its theoretical decision threshold as well as detection probability are accurately determined. Utilizing asymptotic expansion approach, we calculate the asymptotic null distribution as a function of central chi-square distributions, resulting in precise closed-form formula for thresholding. On the other hand, the nonnull distribution is approximated by weighted sum of noncentral chi-square distributions and Gamma distribution for close and far hypotheses, respectively. This enables us to derive a closed-form formula to precisely evaluate the detection power of the LMPIT. Numerical results demonstrate that our theoretical computations are very accurate in determining the decision threshold and predicting the behaviors of the LMPIT. Moreover, the superiority of the LMPIT for MIMO radar target detection over state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated for spatially colored but temporarily white noise.	approximation algorithm;coherent;computation;mimo;numerical linear algebra;profiling (computer programming);thresholding (image processing);weight function;white noise	Yu-Hang Xiao;Lei Huang;Jian-Kang Zhang;Junhao Xie;Hing Cheung So	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2801802	mimo;asymptotic expansion;electronic engineering;mathematical optimization;sphericity;gamma distribution;null distribution;radar;computer science;invariant (mathematics);white noise	ML	49.936624417334585	86.86852953429393	153625

With the use of spectrum sensing algorithms, the cognitive radio is required to detect co-existing licensed primary transmissions and to protect them from interference. This paper focuses on filter-bank-based sensing and provides a solid theoretical background for the design of these detectors. Optimum detectors based on the Neyman-Pearson theorem are developed for uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and modified DFT filter banks with root-Nyquist filters. The proposed sensing framework does not require frequency alignment between the filter bank of the sensor and the primary signal. Each wideband primary channel is spanned and monitored by several sensor subchannels that analyse it in narrowband signals. Filter-bank-based sensing is proved to be robust and efficient under coloured noise. Moreover, the performance of the weighted energy detector as a sensing technique is evaluated. Finally, based on the Locally Most Powerful and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio test, real-world sensing algorithms that do not require a priori knowledge are proposed and tested.	algorithm;cognitive radio;discrete fourier transform;filter bank;interference (communication);primary channel;sensor	Konstantinos N.

However, the computational cost on obtaining efficient SDF rule becomes infeasible even with a small number of cooperative users. In this paper, the efficiency of SDF rule in inhomogeneous background is studied from the perspective of quantization theory. We formulate the calculation of sensing performance including the probabilities of detection and false alarm when regarding both i) the quantization impact and ii) the inhomogeneous background, and then conclude a condition under which the sensing performance can be calculated by the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Based on this condition, two novel quantization schemes with two optimization methods are proposed to guarantee both the quantizer and decision threshold of SDF rule can be obtained efficiently, at the same time, the SDF can achieve high sensing performance.	algorithmic efficiency;cascading style sheets;cognitive radio;fast fourier transform;inductive reasoning;mathematical optimization;quantization (signal processing);triangular function	Weijia Han;Jiandong Li;Yuquan Li;Jiangbo Si;Yan Zhang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2245659	fast fourier transform;cognitive radio;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;probability;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	49.02240465859163	86.60960784796112	154040
6122622365c8c2f95ec87c7e6866846f7c4ef5a9	maximum likelihood sequence detection receivers for nonlinear optical channels		The space-timewhitenedmatched filter (ST-WMF)maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) architecture has been recently proposed (Maggio et al., 2014). Its objective is reducing implementation complexity in transmissions over nonlinear dispersive channels. The ST-WMF-MLSD receiver (i) drastically reduces the number of states of the Viterbi decoder (VD) and (ii) offers a smooth trade-off between performance and complexity. In this work the ST-WMF-MLSD receiver is investigated in detail.We show that the space compression of the nonlinear channel is an instrumental property of the ST-WMF-MLSD which results in a major reduction of the implementation complexity in intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) fiber optic systems. Moreover, we assess the performance of ST-WMF-MLSD in IM/DD optical systems with chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD). Numerical results for a 10Gb/s, 700 km, and IM/DD fiber-optic link with 50 ps differential group delay (DGD) show that the number of states of the VD in ST-WMF-MLSD can be reduced ∼4 times compared to an oversampledMLSD. Finally, we analyze the impact of the imperfect channel estimation on the performance of the ST-WMF-MLSD. Our results show that the performance degradation caused by channel estimation inaccuracies is low and similar to that achieved by existingMLSD schemes (∼0.2 dB).		Gabriel N.

One of the most important challenge of a cognitive radio system is to identify the presence of primary (licensed) users over a wide range of frequency spectrum at a particular time and specific geographic location. In this paper, a spectrum sensing technique for cognitive radios based on discriminant analysis, called spectrum discriminator is studied. It is a blind detection technique where no prior knowledge about the measured signal is needed. In this paper, this spectrum sensing technique is extended to a cooperative environment using an adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing scheme based on the optimal data fusion rule. In the proposed method, secondary users efficiently cooperate to achieve superior detection accuracy with minimum cooperation overhead. The algorithm is able to detect the presence or absence of signals in any kind of spectrum. Hence, this method becomes a strong basis for a high quality operation mode of cognitive radios. Simulation results show that the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme outperforms the conventional methods even under low SNR conditions.	algorithm;cognitive radio;discriminator;display resolution;geographic coordinate system;informatics;linear discriminant analysis;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density	Bini Mathew;Ebin M.

At first, in the case of noise variance uncertainty, the effectiveness of the conventional GLRT is compared to eigenvalue grads method (EGM) and energy detection (ED) method. Then, the challenge of spectrum sensing for GLRT algorithm under unknown-variance colored-noise is solved by optimization problem on CVX (MATLAB-based modeling system for convex optimization). It is approved that likelihood ratio (LLR) under colored noise can be converted to the white noise problem using the correction factor on the eigenvalues. This approach implemented on a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system such that only one of K transmitting antennas which causes the largest eigenvalue is active. Simulation results in white as well as colored noises show higher performance for the modified GLRT respect to the conventional GLRT. Moreover, the required number of samples for the modified GLRT is sufficiently lower than that for the conventional GLRT. Finally, ergodic capacities for conventional and modified versions of GLRT are compared.	algorithm;cognitive radio;colors of noise;convex optimization;ergodicity;input/output;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;matlab;mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;transmitter;white noise	Ameneh Habibzadeh;Shahriar Shirvani Moghaddam	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)	10.1109/ISSPIT.2015.7394322	colors of noise;telecommunications;sensor;mathematical model;mathematics;white noise;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Arch	47.16677098951508	86.15964304878999	158325

(study of widely linear receivers for fbmc-oqam modulations)		During the last two decades, the increase of wireless communications throughput has necessitated more and more complex equalization techniques. To solve this issue, multicarrier modulations have been massively adopted in high data rates wireless communications standards. A typical example of the wide use of these waveforms is the adoption of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) for the downlink of 4G mobile networks. However, for nextgeneration 5G networks, the expected increase of M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications prevents the use of OFDM because of the tight time and frequency synchronization constraints imposed by this waveform. Additionally, efficient spectrum occupation through cognitive radio strategies are incompatible with the poor spectral localization of OFDM. In this context, FBMC-OQAM (Filter Bank Multi-Carrier Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) waveforms appeared as a potential solution to these issues. However, equalization of FBMC-OQAM in frequency selective channels and/or MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) channels is not straightforward because of residual intrinsic interferences between FBMC-OQAM subcarriers. Thus, this thesis considers equalization techniques for these links. In particular, the study of WL (Widely Linear) receivers allowing the mitigation of interferences, with only a single antenna, among networks using second-order noncircular waveforms (e.g. ASK, GMSK, OQAM signals) is privileged. This work studied this technique, named SAIC (Single Antenna Interference Cancellation) and applied for the suppression of co-channel interferences in GSM networks in order to adapt it for the cancellation of FBMC-OQAM intercarrier interferences. SAIC, which was further extended to multiple receive antennas (MAIC Multiple Antenna Interference Cancellation) benefits of its low complexity and does not generate error propagation at low SNR contrary to successive interference cancellation based solutions. A progressive approach is adopted, from SAIC/MAIC for the suppression of co-channel interferences where we emphasize the importance of considering the cyclostationary nature of OQAM communication signals. Based on this, the proposal of a new WL-FRESH (FREquencySHift) filter based receiver for OQAM-like signals is made and its performance is characterized analytically and by numerical simulations asserting its superior performance with respect to the standard WL receiver. The extension of SAIC/MAIC for the mitigation of a frequency-shifted interference is then considered and reception structures are proposed and analyzed in detail. The capacity of WL-FRESH filter based SAIC receivers to perform the suppression of multiple frequency-shifted interferences is assessed. In the context of FBMC-OQAM signals which frequently utilize the PHYDYAS pulse-shaping prototype filter, each subcarrier is polluted only by its adjacent subcarriers. However, to evaluate SAIC processing without having to consider neighboring subcarriers of the adjacent ones, a filtering operation prior to the SAIC processing is needed. For this reason, the impact of a reception filter on the performance gain provided by the SAIC processing was analysed. In a last step, an alternative equalization approach for FBMC-OQAM is investigated. This proposed technique consists in the per-subcarrier joint demodulation of the subcarrier of interest and its interfering adjacent ones after a filtering step. This proposal is considered in the context of MIMO Alamouti FBMC-OQAM links.		Rémi Chauvat	2017				Mobile	49.68594397043104	82.99173230866558	161245

a39b24806e4f72daeaedfc6a3893296ae165b3c9	improved ultra-wideband pulse shaping technique based on spectrum shifted gaussian waveforms		In the ultra-wideband (UWB) communication system, Gaussian monocycle is the most frequently used due to its simplicity. However, in a Gaussian monocycle, the most of signal energy is concentrated in low frequency band, in which direct current components exist. Therefore, it cannot fully meet the U.S. Federal Communication Commission (FCC) on radiation template requirements. Meanwhile, in order to avoid the interference with other wireless systems, good pulse design is particularly important. Accordingly, several pulses were proposed, such as Scholtz’s pulse, Hermite pulse, and spectrum shifted Gaussian waveforms (SSGW) pulse. However, it was shown that coefficient adjustment of SSGW pulse requires too many computations or iterations. In this paper, in order to overcome this drawback, random selection (RS) and Least Square Error (LSE) algorithms are introduced to the SSGW pulse design. Correspondingly, an improved SSGW waveform design is presented. Our analysis and results show that the improved approach has significant flexibility in designing and therefore it can meet the requirements of FCC spectrum mask better.	algorithm;coefficient;computation;frequency band;gaussian (software);interference (communication);iteration;noise shaping;pulse shaping;reed–solomon error correction;requirement;spectral mask;ultra-wideband;waveform	Danli Liu;Zhonghua Liang;Laning Ma;Huansheng Song	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-78130-3_15	communications system;radiation;pulse shaping;interference (wave propagation);electronic engineering;ultra-wideband;waveform;gaussian;pulse (signal processing);computer science	EDA	49.219703669592	83.01523840852845	165270

Spectrum sensing (SS) constitutes the most critical part in CR systems since the CR needs to detect the presence of primary signals reliably and quickly. Energy detection (ED) based SS is considered as the most preferable SS technique due to its simplicity and applicability. However, it is influenced by the effect of noise uncertainty which highly degrades its sensing performance. Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is also introduced to mitigate some sensing problems such as multipath fading, shadowing, and hidden node problems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fusion center (FC) rule for soft decision CSS using ED, which highly alleviates the noise uncertainty effect and enhances the sensing performance of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In the proposed fusion rule, to increase the probability of detection and decrease the probability of false alarm, two dynamic thresholds are utilized by the FC. These thresholds are toggled based on predicting the current activity of the primary user (PU), and their values are dynamically changed based on estimating the noise uncertainty factor of the collected energy measurements from the CRs. To effectively predict (estimate) the current PU activity (the noise uncertainty factor), simple successive averaging processes over the collected energy measurements (the estimated noise variances) are performed by the FC, respectively. Theoretical analysis is performed on the proposed fusion rule for soft decision CSS to evaluate its enhanced false alarm and detection probabilities using different data combining schemes. Performance evaluations are also investigated to confirm the theoretical claims and to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme over the conventional ED based soft decision CSS.		Hossam M.

Several schemes are proposed that employ cooperative decision rules based on local sensor decisions transmitted to the fusion center by the cooperating nodes over an orthogonal multiple access channel. First, fusion rules are derived under perfect CSI at the fusion center for both antipodal and nonantipodal signaling. Then, a robust detector, termed the uncertainty statistics-based likelihood ratio test, which optimally combines the decisions of different secondary users, is obtained for scenarios with CSI uncertainty. A generalized likelihood ratio test based robust detector is also derived for this scenario.

This paper proposes a robust decision fusion scheme that can perform well when interference caused by other sources is present. Specifically, the proposed detection scheme is based on fusing the local decisions from energy detectors and cyclostationarity-based detectors. The proposed fusion scheme is different from other power spectrum-sensing technology developed so far in that other fusion technologies are based on fusing the local decisions from the same type of detectors instead of the different types of detectors as considered here. The proposed scheme was compared with schemes fusing the same type of detectors, and the results show that the proposed scheme is more robust against possible interference.	cognitive radio;cyclostationary process;interference (communication);national supercomputer centre in sweden;sensor;simulation;spectral density;stationary process;telecommunications network	Tsang-Yi Wang;Ming-Fong Hsu;Jwo-Yuh Wu;Jian-Lang Gao	2013	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2013.056415	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;interference;spectral density;computer network	Mobile	49.04890678340627	85.7943832543534	168809

To optimize the pilot tones, upper bound of MSE is used as the objective function of PSO. The effects of Doppler shifts on designing pilot tones are also investigated.

This makes the receiver design particularly easy since it eliminates the need for equalizers and produces robustness to fading and other channel artifacts.

Based on the detection of primary users’ signals, a CR can fully exploit wireless radio resources, thus to increase spectrum efficiency and allow opportunistic transmissions for secondary users. This work presents a spectrum sensing approach for its applications in a wireless regional area network (WRAN) based on features detection of advanced television systems committee (ATSC) digital TV and WRAN signals over a Rayleigh fading channel. The scheme aims at detecting and identifying both ATSC and WRAN signals. To improve spectrum sensing performance in low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, the characteristics of both ATSC and WRAN signals are exploited in spectrum sensing algorithms based on a correlation-based feature identification approach. In this study, real working scenarios of a WRAN CR network are considered. The effectiveness of the proposed detector has been verified by simulations.	cognitive radio	W.-L. Chin;H.-C. Kuo;H.-H.

In this paper, we analyze the Cognitive Radio decision engine based on OFDM system, and introduce a binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm (BQPSO), which has stronger optimal searching ability and faster convergence speed. Because quantum effect has the excellent characteristics of nonlinearity and uncertainty, it can reach better optimize performance than other optimization algorithms. Based on OFDM system, the simulation results show that BQPSO algorithm has a good performance in convergence, speed, and average fitness value.

Most backscatter protocols operate in a sequential TDMA-like manner due to the fact that most nodes cannot overhear each other's transmissions, which is detrimental for throughout and energy consumption. Recent efforts to separate concurrent signals by inverting a system of linear equations is also problematic due to varying channel coefficients caused by system and environmental dynamics. In this paper, we introduce BST, a novel physical layer for backscatter communication that enables concurrent transmission by leveraging intra-bit multiplexing of OOK signals from multiple tags. The key idea underlying BST is that the reader can sample at considerably higher rates than the tags, hence it can extract time-domain signal edges that result from interleaved transmissions of several tags. Our preliminary experiment results show that BST can achieve 5× the throughput of Buzz and 10× the throughput of TDMA-based solutions, such as EPC Gen 2.	backscatter (email);coefficient;denial-of-service attack;electronic product code;linear equation;multiplexing;radio-frequency identification;system of linear equations;throughput	Pan Hu;Pengyu Zhang;Deepak Ganesan	2014		10.1145/2643614.2643617	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Networks	50.461254118753224	82.14433287702657	176324
df3102ece3217ef8d37d40c8d139347e98f596ec	self-correction phase noise compensation based on decision feedback in sc-fde satellite systems		Single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) occupies a concise transmitting structure and a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). These advantages are conducive to the miniaturization of the satellite systems and increase the robustness to the non-linear distortion of amplifiers. Nowadays, satellite communication systems set out to work at Ka or higher frequency bands to support the high data rate links. With the continuously rising level of the frequency in satellite communications, the effect of phase noise (PHN) also keeps increasing. So it is important to estimate and compensate the PHN in the SC-FDE satellite systems. In this paper, we design a novel self-correction phase noise compensation (SC-PNC) algorithm which is based on decision feedback in SC-FDE satellite systems. In the initial stage of our algorithm, with the aid of the receiver, the rough estimation of PHN is calculated by using the pilot signal, then the pilot rough compensation (PRC) is implemented. In the following self-correction stage, the feedback PHN is computed by the received and feedback signals. The inappropriate values are replaced according to the proposed self-correction threshold afterwards. Finally, the revised PHN compensates the received signal and we execute the front processes iteratively. The DVB-S2 and Wiener PHN models are considered in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the bit error rate (BER) performance.	adobe framemaker;algorithm;amplifier;analysis of algorithms;bit error rate;carrier frequency;communications satellite;computational complexity theory;dvb-s2;data rate units;digital video broadcasting;distortion;feedback;frequency band;iteration;iterative method;ka band;nonlinear system;phase noise;power architecture platform reference;rough set;simulation;transmitter;wiener connector;x.690	Xu Chen;Cheng Wang;Gaofeng Cui;Weidong Wang;Xiuhua Li	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170879	phase noise;real-time computing;bit error rate;frequency domain;computer science;pilot signal;sc-fde;equalization (audio);distortion;amplifier;control theory	Robotics	47.66802328990457	81.90244530288903	176842
83af1ecc730d6208216c4e212fc79f2aae70269d	sub-nyquist sampling receiver for overlay cognitive radio users		The secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio (CR) networks exploit the underutilized radio spectrum of the primary networks. In overlay CR systems, transmit waveforms can be designed either in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing or in multicarrier code division multiple access modulation formats by deactivating subcarriers corresponding to primary users’ frequency bands to avoid interference. Transmissions of these overlay CR waveforms are expected to be extremely wideband, occupying up to 1 GHz of bandwidth. As reception of such wideband signals requires very high Nyquist sampling rates, we propose to employ a sub-Nyquist sampling front end. The proposed sub-Nyquist sampling receiver collects as coherently as possible all the SU signals spread across the entire frequency span of interest. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed receiver performs very close to the Nyquist rate receiver with significantly reduced complexity.	cognitive radio;frequency band;interference (communication);modulation;multiplexing;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);simulation;subcarrier	Murat Torlak;Won Namgoong	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2839611	code division multiple access;cognitive radio;nyquist rate;modulation;control theory;mathematics;wideband;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;electronic engineering;bandwidth (signal processing);multiplexing	Mobile	47.97705842430708	82.97854350625653	177441
cb08d5a70370dd0acf9633ccdd3a05c7d6d5c31c	particle swarm optimization based noncoherent detector for ultra-wideband radio in intensive multipath environments	signal image and speech processing;ultra wideband;quantum information technology spintronics;particle swarm optimizer	Given the dense multipath propagation in typical ultra-wideband channels, traditional coherent receivers may become computationally complex and impractical. Recently, noncoherent UWB architectures have been motivated with simple implementations. Nevertheless, the rudimentary statistical assumption and practical information uncertainty inevitably results in a hardly optimistic receiving performance. Inspired by the nature processes, in this paper we suggest a noncoherent UWB demodulator based on the particle swarm intelligence which can be realized in two steps. Firstly, a characteristic spectrum is developed from the received samples. From a novel pattern recognition perspective, four distinguishing features are extracted from this characteristic waveform to thoroughly reveal the discriminant properties of UWB multipath signals and channel noise. Subsequently, this established multidimensional feature space is compressed to a two-dimension plane by the optimal features combination technique, and UWB signal detection is consequently formulated to assign these pattern points into two classes at the minimum errors criterion. The optimal combination coefficients and the decision bound are then numerically derived by using the particle swarm optimization. Our biological noncoherent UWB receiver is independent of any explicit channel parameters, and hence is essentially robust to noise uncertainty. Numerical simulations further validate the advantages of our algorithm over the other noncoherent techniques.	algorithm;coefficient;coherence (physics);computation;detection theory;discriminant;feature vector;loop variant;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;particle swarm optimization;pattern recognition;requirement;signal processing;simulation;software propagation;swarm intelligence;ultra-wideband;waveform;whole earth 'lectronic link	Bin Li;Zheng Zhou;Weixia Zou;Wanxin Gao	2011	EURASIP J.

An alternative to further enhance data rate is to apply cognitive radio concepts, where a system is able to exploit unused spectrum on existing licensed bands by sensing the spectrum and opportunistically access unused portions. Techniques like Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) could help or be vital for such scenarios. Usually, AMC implementations rely on some form of signal pre-processing, which may introduce a high computational cost or make assumptions about the received signal which may not hold (e.g. Gaussianity of noise). This work proposes a new method to perform AMC which uses a similarity measure from the Information Theoretic Learning (ITL) framework, known as correntropy coefficient. It is capable of extracting similarity measurements over a pair of random processes using higher order statistics, yielding in better similarity estimations than by using e.g. correlation coefficient. Experiments with binary modulations show that in the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), a 97% success rate in classification is achieved at a Signal-to-Noise Rate (SNR) of 5dB without requiring any pre-processing at all.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;advanced mezzanine card;algorithmic efficiency;automatic differentiation;cognitive radio;correlation dimension;experiment;inferential theory of learning;jaccard index;matthews correlation coefficient;modulation;multipath propagation;preprocessor;quality of service;signal-to-noise ratio;similarity measure;simulation;stochastic process;throughput;uncompressed video	Aluisio I.

The system under study employs features extraction based on higher order statistics (HOS) of the received signal. Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, our study shows that J48 classifier is more efficient than the multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained with resilient backpropagation training algorithm (RPROP) where it achieves close to perfect detection rate (over 99%) with reasonable training time in acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. We also show that the performance of the MIMO relaying broadcast network is remarkably better than the traditional MIMO one.	algorithm;backpropagation;compaq lte;cooperative mimo;decision tree;inline linking;interoperability;key (cryptography);mimo;memory-level parallelism;microwave;modulation;multi-user mimo;multilayer perceptron;naive bayes classifier;pattern recognition;receiver operating characteristic;rprop;signal-to-noise ratio	Wassim Ben Chikha;Iyad Dayoub;Walaa Hamouda;Rabah Attia	2014	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2013.111113.130655	telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;decision tree	Mobile	53.58376453287082	83.21118160273595	180329

One significant problem associated with OFDM is the possibility of large side-lobes in its spectrum. In this paper, we consider the so-called N-continuous method for reducing the side-lobes. We first consider one implementation approach, whereby certain sub-carriers are reserved for the purpose of adjusting the spectrum of an OFDM symbol. We find that significant side-lobe reduction is possible, although at the cost of injecting very large power in the reserved sub-carriers that results in unacceptable spectrum overshoot. In order to achieve reasonable power levels, at least 20% of all sub-carriers must be reserved for weighting. As a solution to the problem of spectrum overshoot, we propose an alternative approach whereby the power of the reserved sub-carriers is constrained. Numerical results show that reasonable power levels are achieved at the cost of significant performance loss in the N-continuous OFDM technique for side-lobe reduction. We thus find that the performance cost of eliminating the spectrum overshoot reduces the side-lobes reduction to less than 5 dB in cases of interest.	acoustic lobing;eisenstein's criterion;frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing;numerical method;overshoot (signal);scott continuity;simulation;subcarrier;uncompressed video	Jesse Haber-Kucharsky;Ehsan Haj Mirza Alian;Patrick Mitran	2013	2013 13th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory	10.1109/CWIT.2013.6621622	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;control theory;mathematics	EDA	48.742260193745054	81.96636290484646	181140

As a result, spectrum sensing has gained increasing interest from governments, industry and regulators. In this paper, a novel approach for cooperative spectrum sensing is proposed based on a modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). This approach is to fuse the perceived results of multiple nodes, and to improve the detection reliability. Simulations are used to compare the performance of the modified SFLA to the conventional one. The performance of the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing method based on the modified SFLA and that of the cooperative spectrum sensing method using modified deflection coefficient (MDC) are also compared. Results show that the proposed SFLA outperforms the traditional SFLA, and the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing method based on the modified SFLA gives higher miss detection probability than the MDC-based method, which validates the effectiveness of the modified SFLA-based cooperative sensing method.	algorithm;coefficient;computer simulation;full-spectrum light;list of metaphor-based metaheuristics;spectrum analyzer;tau-leaping	Xunqian Tong;Yanju Ji;Jun Lin;Jinbao Zhu;Feng Sun;Yi Zhong;Yang Yang;Xi Zhu	2017	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2017.08.014	fuse (electrical);real-time computing;computer science;wireless;shuffled frog leaping algorithm	Mobile	50.730091015054306	86.22581334505462	182446

However, the presence of long multipaths in ultra-wideband channels usually gives rise to severe interference at the receiver end. Hence, the performance of the received signals cannot be improved further because the conventional Rake receivers do not take into account the long multipath effect. In this paper, we propose to shorten the long multipath propagation by minimizing the variance of the distribution of the received signals. The new proposed statistical selection Rake receiver is capable of selecting the most significant combining paths in order to achieve a minimum variance distribution. Further improvement has been done to reduce the computational complexity by introducing two different type of adaptive windowed statistical selection schemes. The performance of all proposed schemes has been simulated under ultra-wideband IEEE P802.15.3a standard channel models. From the results, the proposed Rake receivers are able to minimize the long multipath effect significantly by achieving more than 50% reduction of the variance distribution as compared to the other Rake receivers.	multipath propagation;rake;ultra-wideband;window function	Gwo C.

We propose a group testing-based spectrum hole search algorithm that exploits sparsity in the primary spectral occupancy by testing a group of adjacent subbands in a single test. This is enabled by a simple and easily implementable sub-Nyquist sampling scheme for signal acquisition by the cognitive radios (CRs). The sampling scheme deliberately introduces aliasing during signal acquisition, resulting in a signal that is the sum of signals from adjacent subbands. Energy-based hypothesis tests are used to provide an occupancy decision over the group of subbands, and this forms the basis of the proposed algorithm to find contiguous spectrum holes of a specified bandwidth. We extend this framework to a multistage sensing algorithm that can be employed in a variety of spectrum sensing scenarios, including noncontiguous spectrum hole search. Furthermore, we provide the analytical means to optimize the group tests with respect to the detection thresholds, number of samples, group size, and number of stages to minimize the detection delay under a given error probability constraint. Our analysis allows one to identify the sparsity and SNR regimes where group testing can lead to significantly lower detection delays compared with a conventional bin-by-bin energy detection scheme; the latter is, in fact, a special case of the group test when the group size is set to 1 bin. We validate our analytical results via Monte Carlo simulations.	aliasing;cognitive radio;monte carlo method;multistage amplifier;sampling (signal processing);search algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix	Abhay Sharma;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy	2014	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2305978	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;mathematics	Mobile	51.16797257329811	84.73444194754457	189483

The improved energy detector uses the pth power of the absolute value of samples of primary user's (PU's) signals. We replace the conventional energy detector by an improved energy detector to enhance the performance of CR. Analytical expressions of the probability of false alarm and missed detection in each CR are derived. Furthermore, we extend our study to a multihop cooperative diversity system containing multiple multihop secondary transmission paths between the PU and the fusion center. Performance analysis of multihop cooperative diversity is discussed using an improved energy detector. We introduce a framework to derive a closed-form expression of the optimal number of multihop cooperative diversity branches by minimizing the total error rate. An efficient quick spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed, which requires fewer than the total number of cooperative multihop diversity branches. It is shown, through various numerical examples, that by using the optimal number of secondary transmission paths, it is possible to perform quick spectrum sensing while satisfying an upper bound on the total error rate.	algorithm;binary symmetric channel;cognitive radio;hp 48 series;markov chain;numerical analysis;one-class classification;quality of service;singular value decomposition;stochastic matrix;the matrix	Ajay Singh;Manav R.

Under these assumptions, the problem of identifying the active users reduces to that of recovering a sparse binary vector from noisy random linear measurements. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is proposed in this paper to recover the set of active users. A fast approximate Bayesian inference based on Variational Bayes (VB) is then developed. Extensive simulation results are then provided to compare the performance of the proposed VB based Bayesian MUD approach to sparse estimation techniques such as OMP and LASSO. It is observed that the proposed approach is robust to variations in noise as well as sparsity levels. Further, for a given BER performance, the proposed approach requires substantially smaller dimensional codes as compared to OMP and LASSO, thus improving the spectral efficiency.	random access;variational principle	Rituraj Singh Jodha;Priyadip Ray	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-018-5356-7	computer science;multiuser detection;real-time computing;lasso (statistics);bayes' theorem;spectral efficiency;pattern recognition;bayesian probability;communication channel;random access;artificial intelligence;bayesian inference	Mobile	49.95745886209577	87.39619221957776	190948

Noise uncertainty poses a significant challenge to the development of such schemes, requiring some degree of diversity (spatial, temporal, or in distribution) for identifiability of the noise level. Multiantenna detectors exploit spatial independence of receiver thermal noise. We review this class of schemes and propose a novel detector trading off performance and complexity. However, most of these methods assume that the noise power, though unknown, is the same at all antennas. As it turns out, calibration errors have a substantial impact on these detectors. Another novel detector is proposed, based on an approximation to the Generalized Likelihood Ratio, outperforming previous schemes for uncalibrated multiantenna receivers.	approximation;cognitive radio;johnson–nyquist noise;mimo;monte carlo method;noise (electronics);noise power;programming paradigm;sensor;simulation	Roberto López-Valcarce;Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar;Josep Sala-Alvarez	2010	2010 2nd International Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing	10.1109/CIP.2010.5604095	electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	49.62652912832431	86.42212305641284	192668

We focus on the target detection problem in passive multistatic radar consisting of a non-cooperative illuminator of opportunity, and several spatially separated surveillance receivers. Two F -test based detectors are proposed for target detection in this passive multistatic radar. They both exhibit a constant false alarm rate with respect to noise power. We drive closed-form expressions for the probability of false alarm of the proposed detector for the case of equal noise power in each receivers.

What is worse, that will add computational complexity of the following signal reconstruction. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel wideband spectrum sensing approach based on time-domain coprime sampling. Our approach first estimates the power spectrum of the wideband signal by employing the coprime sampling scheme, then performs detection via a subband-bin energy detector. The cornerstone of our approach is that we can generate a Nyquist space sampled autocorrelation from the sub-Nyquist samples by implementing the coprime sampling scheme. Demonstrated by the simulations, our proposed wideband sensing approach has a better performance under high compression ratio and a better robustness against noise compared with the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Also it is illustrated that our approach has the advantage over computational complexity by analyzing. Considering the merits synthetically, the novel wideband sensing approach adapts better to a higher bandwidth by comparision.	algorithm;autocorrelation;bandwidth (signal processing);compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;list of fourier-related transforms;matching pursuit;openmp;requirement;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;simulation;spectral density	Shiyu Ren;Zhimin Zeng;Caili Guo;Xuekang Sun	2015	2015 22nd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2015.7124709	estimation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;sensor;noise;control theory;mathematics;computational complexity theory;correlation;statistics	EDA	51.54261601480484	84.12351777161676	196672

The performance of detecting the existence of primary signals will be more crucial for the EH node. However, to the best of our knowledge, no dynamic threshold-setting method to achieve target detection performance, particularly in the practical non-Gaussian noise, is reported in the literature. Traditional assumption of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) fails to model the behavior of certain types of noise found in practice. In this paper we give a dynamic threshold-setting method to detect the existence of primary signals for the energy harvesting node in non-Gaussian noise background. Combined with the fractional lower order statistics (FLOS), we propose a weighting factor for dynamic threshold-setting to exploit the existence of the PU to harvest RF energy, namely weighting factor based fractional lower order moment (WF-FLOM) detector. Numerical simulation results verify that the proposed method is effective for the EH node, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low or the back ground noise varies.

When the conversion factor is (N ±α)/N, the number of possible patterns of insertion/deletion points and the number of combinations for multiple set inserters/deleters grow as α increases. The proposed algorithm minimizes the distortion due to SRC by selecting the patterns and the combinations.	conversion marketing;distortion;sample rate conversion;selection algorithm	Akira Tanaka;Yukitoshi Sanada	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449752	mathematical optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;software-defined radio;mathematics;phase distortion;wireless	Arch	47.26365981688818	81.90477931392101	197946

In contrast to classical schemes, which calibrate nonlinear distortions in transmitters, we suggest a nonlinear equalization algorithm, with which the multipath channel and unknown symbols contaminated by nonlinear distortions and multipath interferences are estimated in receiver-ends. Attributed to the nonlinearity and marginal integration, the involved posterior density is analytically intractable and, unfortunately, most existing linear equalization schemes may become invalid. To solve this problem, the Monte-Carlo sequential importance sampling based particle filtering is suggested, and the non-analytical distribution is approximated numerically by a group of random measures with the evolving probability-mass. By applying the Taylor's series expansion technique, a local-linearization observation model is further constructed to facilitate the practical design of a sequential detector. Thus, the unknown symbols are detected recursively as new observations arrive. Simulation results validate the proposed joint detection scheme. By excluding transmitting pre-distortion of high complexity, the presented algorithm is specially designed for the receiver-end, which provides a promising framework to nonlinear equalization and signal detection in millimeter-wave communications.	amplifier;approximation algorithm;baseband;detection theory;distortion;exptime;embedded system;importance sampling;marginal model;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;particle filter;programming paradigm;radio frequency;recursion;sampling (signal processing);sensor;series expansion;simulation;state transition table;transmitter;uninterruptible power supply;upwind scheme	Bin Li;Chenglin Zhao;Mengwei Sun;Haijun Zhang;Zheng Zhou;Arumugam Nallanathan	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2412119	nonlinear distortion;estimation;particle filter;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;wireless;statistics;detection theory	EDA	52.0568824603302	83.74102118708339	199546
