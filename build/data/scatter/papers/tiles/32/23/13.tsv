In this paper, a global motion/local motion (GM/LM) based error concealment technique is proposed for transporting MPEG-4 advanced simple profile (ASP) coded video over high lossy and noisy networks. Different from the conversional error concealment methods, which make full use of the temporal spatial information to recover the error macro-blocks, the proposed GM/LM based method can efficiently improve the reconstructed video quality by using the redundant information which sent at encoder side. The redundant information consists of the global motion parameters and global motion compensation/local motion compensation (GMC/LMC) map information for each macro-block (MB) of P-frames. Comparison results with different error concealment methods on different video sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed GM/LM based error concealment method.	advanced audio coding;cognitive dimensions of notations;encoder;error concealment;global motion compensation;little man computer;lossy compression	Xueming Qian;Guizhong Liu;Huan Wang	2008	2008 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.268	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;transform coding;telecommunications;computer science;noise measurement;video quality;wireless network;motion estimation;spatial analysis;forward error correction;motion compensation;pixel;statistics	Robotics	48.38505019743474	-16.321764216269173	188624

As a new performance measure in statistical optimization of filter banks the norm of cross-correlation (all subbands including all delays) will be used for optimization. The obtained filters will be compared to filters having minimum reconstruction error when the highpass branches are dropped. In the paraunitary case, which is considered here, this reconstruction error is closely related to the coding gain of PCM in subbands over direct PCM. While the KL-transform combines both minimum reconstruction error and perfect decorrelation, filter banks do not. It is clear that the norm of cross-correlation becomes very important when better techniques than PCM are considered for the coding of subband signals.	coding gain;cross-correlation;decorrelation;filter bank;mathematical optimization;principal component analysis;quadrature mirror filter;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelet	Alfred Mertins	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.390077	pulse-code modulation;computer vision;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Vision	47.67216533610625	-11.718283405106197	191761

The perceptually-based image coder consists of a wavelet transformation, uniform quantizatio n, and variable-length entropy encoding. The coded data is placed in a spatially scalable stream divided into segments of varying perceptual importance and tolerance to transmis sion errors. A novel unequal error protection system is designed using turbo codes for the wireless channel, neural networks to predict decoder error and calculate erasures, and outer turbo-code concatenation of Reed-Solomon codes at different rates. A model of error tolerance is developed to minimize the added redundancy required to meet the desired throughput performance and visual quality level. The proposed system provides excellent reliability allowing t he transmission of high visual quality images at a small additional redundancy and low signal-to-noise ratio (4.5 dB).	artificial neural network;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;entropy encoding;error-tolerant design;reed–solomon error correction;scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;sion's minimax theorem;throughput;turbo code;wavelet transform	Michael Eoin Buckley;Marcia G.

Based on Shannon’s source coding theorem, a theoretical justification is provided for this linear source model. The physical meaning of the model parameter is also discussed. We show that it is directly related to the image content and is a measure of picture complexity. In video coding, we propose an adaptive estimation scheme to estimate this model parameter. Based on the linear source model and the adaptive estimation scheme, a unified rate control algorithm is proposed for various standard video coding systems, such as MPEG-2, H.263, and MPEG-4. Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed rate control outperforms other algorithms reported in the literature by providing much more accurate and robust rate control.	algorithm;coefficient;data compression;discrete cosine transform;ising model;line source;mpeg-2;open-source software;scheme;shannon (unit);shannon's source coding theorem;simulation;transform coding	Zhihai He;Sanjit K.

Noting that the performance of an arithmetic coder is as good as its estimation of the statistics of the input, we split our quantizer into two building blocks: model estimation and quantizer design. The main idea is that , as long as the model estimation manages to track down the changes in source statistics, a standard quantizer design technique which assumes that the source follows the estimated model can be used. As an example of this type of design we study an adaptive scalar quantization scheme where we impose the restriction that no side information can be sent, i.e. encoder and decoder must perform their adaptation based on the quantized information.	algorithm;arithmetic coding;encoder;lossless compression;quantization (signal processing)	Antonio Ortega;Martin Vetterli	1994		10.1109/ICIP.1994.413725	data compression;adaptive filter;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;lossless compression;statistics	EDA	49.464030186343166	-12.299463187936253	194567

Experiments on 2000 images indicate the watermarks are robust to significant valumetric distortions, including additive noise, low-pass filtering, changes in contrast, and lossy compression. Our system encodes watermark messages with a modified trellis code in which a given message may be represented by a variety of different signals, with the embedded signal selected according to the cover image. The signal is embedded by an iterative method that seeks to ensure the message will not be confused with other messages, even after addition of noise. Fidelity is improved by the incorporation of perceptual shaping into the embedding process.

INTRODUCTION One of the objectives of communication systems designers is the delivering of multimedia data in a fast, reliable,and low cost way. Unfortunately, network congestions, channel variability, attacks, software errors, hardwarefaults, and other factors, are increasing the probability that the transmitted stream will be received partiallyimpaired. Strongest channel coding techniques and retransmission based transport protocols, can improve theexisting performances. When we are dealing with real time communication, such as video conferences or livestreaming, the data becomes useless if it is received with delay. This is especially true when many independentusers, equipped with low power consumption terminals (as new generation of cellular phones equipped alsowith WIFI), send real time MJPEG2000 video to an access point (AP) in case, for example, of emergencysituations as ooding or trac congestion. The peculiarities of this scenario, low power terminals, error pronetransmission channel, and shared communication system, are perfectly tuned to the application of an advancedvideo coding technique.One promising technique for improving streaming media quality is the multiple description coding (MDC).Firstly developed for speech communication over the telephone network, it is now applied for delivering in-formation over noisy and unreliable channels. The basic idea is to split and to encode the source messageinto two (or more) complementary descriptions, which are independently transmitted to the receiver by usingseparate channels or paths. The decoder can reconstruct the original message also from a single descriptorbut with lower quality, such as the baseline quality video. The more descriptors are received, the higher thereconstruction quality. To this aim, a certain amount of redundancy is added to each descriptor, increasing theoverall bit rate. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of MDC when two descriptions of the source are adopted.MDC works dierently than conventional (SDC) Single Description Coders (MPEG, H.261, H.264, ...)which produce a single data stream. As already stated, the cost of this resiliency is in the increased amountof data to be delivered and in increased computational complexity. The more redundancy in each descriptor,the higher the quality when a subset of delivered descriptors is received. The trade-o between complexity andeciency is strictly depending on the application scenario.Starting from the early works on speech communications, many researcher have approached the MDC frame-work.

Having observed in experiments the uncertainty of the source and the channel coding rate, we model them as random variables via offline training, estimate the decoding failure probability and calculate the mean end-to-end distortion. Adaptive quantization is performed for each slice to minimize its mean end-to-end distortion. With this joint source-channel rate allocation, we compare the robustness of two coding prototypes, namely distributed video coding and distributed video coding with forward error correction. According to our experimental results, under same total bit budget, the distributed video coding only scheme proves more robust than the latter one and the gain is up to 1 dB in PSNR.	data compression;decibel;distortion;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;online and offline;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pixel;quantization (signal processing);streaming media	Hu Chen;Eckehard G.

However, for the frames change from one scene to another temporal correlation may be destroyed by temporal sampling extremely, which results in the false estimation when the related frames are lost at the side decoder. Therefore, in this article the frames containing scene change are detected and duplicated before temporal sampling, which maintains better temporal correlation in each description. Furthermore, for better rate distortion performance temporal sampling is employed adaptively, that is, frame skipping or up-sampling according to the motion characteristics in original video. The experimental results exhibit better performance of the proposed scheme than other schemes whether in the on–off MDC environment or packet lossy network, especially about 15 dB improvements for the frames with scene change. Therefore, it may be a promising choice for video transmission over error-prone channels, especially over wireless networks.		Mengmeng Zhang;Huihui Bai	2012	EURASIP J.

The SVQ is a fixed rate encoder and its rate-distortion performance is close to that of optimal entropy-constrained scalar quantizers (ECSQs) for memoryless sources. The use of a fixed-rate quantizer is expected to eliminate some of the complexity of using variable-length scalar quantizers. When transmission of images over noisy channels is considered, our coding scheme does not suffer from error propagation that is typical of coding schemes using variable-length codes. For a set of magnetic resonance (MR) images, coding results obtained from SVQ and ECSQ at low bit rates are indistinguishable. Furthermore, our encoded images are perceptually indistinguishable from the original when displayed on a monitor. This makes our SVQ-based coder an attractive compression scheme for picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). PACS are currently under study for use in an all-digital radiology environment in hospitals, where reliable transmission, storage, and high fidelity reconstruction of images are desired.

In general, the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) is an important concept in image coding. However, predictors which are optimized on the basis of the MSE criterion are not necessarily optimum from a viewpoint of coding efficiency. Thereupon our method optimizes a predictor so that a cost function which represents the amount of information on prediction errors can have a minimum. Simulation results indicate that the proposed coding scheme is superior to the coding scheme which utilizes the conventional MMSE predictors in terms of coding efficiency.	algorithmic efficiency;kerrison predictor;loss function;lossless compression;simulation	Ichiro Matsuda;Hirofumi Mori;Susumu Itoh	2000		10.1109/ICIP.2000.900912	data compression;medical simulation;minimum mean square error;mathematical optimization;shannon–fano coding;design methods;computer science;entropy encoding;context-adaptive variable-length coding;machine learning;mean squared prediction error;coding tree unit;mathematics;predictive modelling;algorithmic efficiency;context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding;digital image;statistics	AI	47.86648670378599	-13.094210446901888	199774
