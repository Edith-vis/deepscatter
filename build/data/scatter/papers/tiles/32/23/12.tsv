f9d40e9807e8c627ff49c8ccaba5fd3fccbc821e	cooperative multi-robot patrol in an indoor infrastructure		Multi-robot patrol (MRP) is essentially a collective decision-makingproblem, where mobile robotic units must coordinate their actions effectively in order to schedule visits to every critical point of the environment. The problem is commonly addressed using centralized planners with global knowledge and/or calculating a priori routes for all robots before the beginning of the mission. However, distributed strategies for MRP have very interesting advantages, such as allowing the team to adapt to changes in the system, the possibility to add or remove patrol units during the mission, and leading to trajectories that are much harder to predict by an external observer. In this work, we present a distributed strategy to solve the patrolling problem in a real world indoor environment, where each autonomous agent decides its actions locally and adapts to the system’s needs using distributed communication. Experimental results show the ability of the team to coordinate so as to visit every important point of the environment. Furthermore, the approach is able to scale to an arbitrary number of robots as well as overcome communication failures and robot faults.	autonomous robot;centralized computing;critical point (network science);experiment;interference (communication);media redundancy protocol;minimal recursion semantics;precomputation;robustness (computer science);scalability;semantics (computer science);sensor	David Portugal;Rui Pedro Rocha	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-10807-0_16	autonomous agent;patrolling;robot;observer (quantum physics);distributed computing;computer science	Robotics	53.72419417807822	-23.008441864442478	188714

To increase the compression accuracy, HEVC employs the coding unit (CU) ranging from 8 × 8 to 64 × 64. However, the encoding complexity of HEVC increase a lot since the manifold partition sizes. A lot of works are focused on reducing the complexity but didn't considered the feasibility of hardware implementation. This paper proposes a hardware friendly fast depth range definition algorithm based on multiple features. Block texture feature, quantization feature and block motion feature are utilized. Block texture feature is based on the texture similarity in consecutive frames. Quantization feature is based on the compression regularity of HEVC. Block motion feature is for compensate the difference caused by the moving object. Comparing with the original HEVC, the proposed method can saved about 33.72% of the processing time with 0.76% of BD-bitrate increase on average.	algorithm;blu-ray;cuda;data compression;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;high efficiency video coding;very-large-scale integration;video coding format	Gaoxing Chen;Zhenyu Liu;Tetsunori Kobayashi;Takeshi Ikenaga	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852694	computer vision;quantization;quarter-pixel motion;computer science;theoretical computer science;pattern recognition;mathematics;very-large-scale integration;correlation;encoding	Robotics	46.99176872573617	-19.575790030347022	189375

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of the concept of data-rate PSNR information table (DRPIT), which facilitates for very fast packet scheduling during video streaming. Rate-distortion characteristic of the compressed video is extracted during preprocessing and is stored as DRPIT. The second contribution is an efficient algorithm to compute DRPIT during preprocessing, which decreases the computation time drastically. The algorithm exploits the acyclic dependency of the independently decodable units of the compressed packetized media. The third contribution consists of the application of DRPIT in variable rate video streaming systems. Two different types of systems are explained using two specific implementations which are also used for performance validation of the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the systems using DRPIT provide 6-10 dB gain, relative to the systems that do not distinguish between individual packets and treat them equally.	algorithm;attribute-value system;baseline (configuration management);computation;data compression;directed acyclic graph;disk space;distortion;enumerated type;experiment;network packet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;preprocessor;scheduling (computing);streaming media;time complexity	Harendra Narayan;Dilip Sarkar;James W.

Wyner-Ziv video coding, a lossy compression with receiver side information, enables low-complexity video encoding at the expense of a complex decoder. Most of the existing distributed video coding techniques require a feedback channel to determine the number of parity bits for decoding Wyner-Ziv frames at the decoder. However, a feedback channel is not available for some applications or a feedback channel-based decoder rate control may not be used due to delay constraints in wireless video sensor network applications. In this paper, an encoder-based rate control method for distributed video coding is proposed. The proposed solution consists of a low complexity side information generation method at the encoder and a rate estimation algorithm that determines the number of parity bits to be transmitted to the decoder. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing encoder-based rate control methods and a decoder-based rate control algorithm based on a feedback channel.	algorithm;bit plane;computational complexity theory;data compression;discrete cosine transform;distortion;encoder;lossy compression;parity bit;programming paradigm;rate–distortion theory;simulation;video;visual sensor network;winzip	Chen Fu;Joohee Kim	2010	2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662042	distributed source coding;wireless sensor network;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;coding tree unit;adaptive coding;context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding;motion compensation;h.261;statistics;multiview video coding	Mobile	49.111318972246565	-17.017777899611456	190275

However, the resources (energy, memory etc.) on mobile devices are limited, thus how to achieve a high coding performance in these devices becomes a big challenge. The recent standards such as H.264, HEVC and audio video coding standard (AVS) employ Rate distortion optimization (RDO) to select the best coding modes, however it results in extremely high computational complexity. This work presents a hardware friendly mode decision (MD) scheme. First, hardware-oriented RDcost estimation method is proposed by using least squares technique to reduce computational burden of RDO-based MD. Second, reconstructed-original (REC-ORG) united intra prediction scheme is presented to break the data dependency, while maintaining high coding performance. Third, highly efficient MD pipeline architecture is put forward to enhance MD processing capacity. The coding efficiency of our adopted MD scheme far outperforms (0.402 dB PSNR gain in average) the traditional SAD methods and the throughput of our designed pipeline is increased by 29%, 23% and 23% for I, P and B frames, respectively, compared with the existed RDO-based architecture.	algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;data compression;data dependency;distortion;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;high efficiency video coding;intra-frame coding;least squares;mathematical optimization;mobile app;mobile device;molecular dynamics;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pipeline (computing);raster document object;rate–distortion optimization;remote data objects;throughput;video coding format	Meng Li;Chuang Zhu;Yuan Li;Xiaofeng Huang;Huizhu Jia;Xiaodong Xie;Wen Gao	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops (ICMEW)	10.1109/ICMEW.2014.6890671	estimation;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;mobile device;pipeline;encoding;statistics	HPC	46.60253346889091	-18.841999965876035	191377

Though the coding efficiency is high, the computational complexity is expensive. This paper presents a proposed algorithm to reduce the encoding time of enhancement layer through probability analysis. Firstly two classes are defined, and the Bayes Classifier decides whether the current macroblock belongs to Big Block class or Small Block class. Then an early termination strategy is checked for ignoring some inter modes. When inter-layer residual prediction is used, the optimal inter mode is set as the best inter mode of co-located macroblock in base layer. For the intra modes, the INTRA_16×16 is skipped based on statistical data. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity with negligible video quality loss and bit rate increment when compared with reference software and other methods.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;data compression;macroblock;requirement;scalability;scalable video coding	Yuan Chun;Fan Min;Zhang Yan	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2011.6011846	scalable video coding;bayes classifier;real-time computing;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;theoretical computer science;machine learning;coding tree unit;computational complexity theory	Robotics	46.72816653753354	-19.403489364210795	192344

In our scheme, we propose an enhancement method of the target frame rate based H.264/AVC bit allocation. The enhancement uses a frame complexity estimation to improve the existing mean absolute difference (MAD) complexity measurement. Bit allocation to each frame is not just computed by target frame rate but also adjusted by a combined frame complexity measure. Using the statistical characteristic, we obtain change of occurrence bit about QP to apply the bit amount by QP from the video characteristic and applied in the estimated bit amount of the current frame. Simulation results show that the proposed rate control scheme achieves time saving of more than 99% over existing rate control algorithm. Nevertheless, PSNR and bit rate were almost same as the performances.	algorithm;blum axioms;computational complexity theory;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;mad;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance;real-time transcription;simulation	Myoung-Jin Kim;Min-Cheol Hong	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.134	residual frame;transmission time;real-time computing;peak signal-to-noise ratio;computer science;theoretical computer science;mean difference;computational complexity theory;encoding;statistics	Mobile	47.38936875842051	-17.927372214256277	192551

Nearly all of these algorithms rely on the assumption: the distortion function increases monotonically as the search location moves away from the global minimum. Obviously, this assumption essentially requires that the error surface be unimodal over the search window. Unfortunately, this is usually not true in real-world video signals. In this paper, we formulate a criterion to check the confidence of unimodal error surface over the search window. The proposed Confidence Measure of Error Surface, CMES, would be a good measure for identifying whether the searching should continue or not. It is found that this proposed measure is able to strengthen the conventional fast search algorithms for block matching motion estimation. Experimental results show that, as compared to the conventional approach, the new algorithm through the CMES is more robust, produces smaller motion compensation errors, and requires simple computational complexity.	computational complexity theory;distortion;maxima and minima;motion compensation;motion estimation;search algorithm;window function	Yui-Lam Chan;Wan-Chi Siu	1999		10.1109/ICASSP.1999.757567	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;motion estimation;mathematics;computational complexity theory;motion compensation;search algorithm	Vision	49.137405998964745	-19.498557962134523	192568

Existing constrained dynamic programming approaches cannot handle a joint chance constraint since their application is limited to constraints in the same form as the cost function, that is, an expectation over a sum of one-stage costs. We overcome this challenge by reformulating the joint chance constraint into a constraint on an expectation over a sum of indicator functions, which can be incorporated into the cost function by dualizing the optimization problem. As a result, the primal variables can be optimized by a standard dynamic programming, while the dual variable is optimized by a root-finding algorithm that converges exponentially. Error bounds on the primal and dual objective values are rigorously derived. We demonstrate the algorithm on a path planning problem, as well as an optimal control problem for Mars entry, descent and landing. The simulations are conducted using a real terrain data of Mars, with four million discrete states at each time step.	dynamic programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;motion planning;optimal control;optimization problem;root-finding algorithm;simulation	Masahiro Ono;Yoshiaki Kuwata;J.

In this paper, we introduce a method that achieves motion estimation in the extremely insufficient computation power. We proposed a low-distortion based PCDB list to achieve better visual quality. To decrease the computation-power requirement, sub sampling technique is coupled with the proposed algorithm. The proposed method significantly reduces the requirement of computation power in computing motion vectors. Satisfactory visual quality can be obtained under the extreme condition.	chroma subsampling;computation;computational resource;distortion;motion estimation;pcdb;peak signal-to-noise ratio;sampling (signal processing);search algorithm	Chi-Kao Chang;Min-Yuan Fang;I-Chang Jou;Nai-Chung Yang;Chung Ming Kuo	2013	2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies	10.1109/ISBAST.2013.30	mathematical optimization;quarter-pixel motion;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning	EDA	47.25706601527487	-19.010049946896608	192810

A dynamic navigation mesh can represent the traversable space of such environments. The A* algorithm computes optimal paths through the dual graph of this mesh. When an obstacle is inserted or deleted, the mesh changes and agents should re-plan their paths. Many existing re-planning algorithms are too memory-intensive for crowds, or they cannot easily be used on graphs where vertices and edges are added or removed. In this paper, we present Dynamically Pruned A* (DPA*), an extension of A* for re-planning optimal paths in dynamic navigation meshes. DPA* has similarities to adaptive algorithms that make the A* heuristic more informed based on previous queries. However, DPA* prunes the search using only the previous path and its relation to the dynamic event. We describe the four re-planning scenarios that can occur; DPA* uses different rules in each scenario. Our algorithm is memory-friendly and robust against structural changes in the graph, which makes it suitable for crowds in dynamic navigation meshes. Experiments show that DPA* performs particularly well in complex environments and when the dynamic event is visible to the agent. We integrate the algorithm into crowd simulation software to model large crowds in dynamic environments in real-time.	a* search algorithm;adaptive algorithm;admissible heuristic;automated planning and scheduling;crowd simulation;dual graph;heuristic (computer science);list of interactive geometry software;navigation mesh;real-time transcription;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation software	Wouter van Toll;Roland Geraerts	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353649	planning;computer vision;navigation;vehicle dynamics;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computational model;memory management	Robotics	52.5984913760849	-23.26288385208156	194105

2c3b509f84731e32ed1526b7a9b1d6452d6c1ed9	motion planning with discrete abstractions and physics-based game engines		To increase automation in game design, this paper proposes a sampling-based motion-planning approach that works in conjunction with physics-based game engines. The approach automatically computes a sequence of motions that enables a virtual agent to reach a desired destination while avoiding collisions. The use of physics-based engines as the underlying simulator results in physically-realistic motions that take into account the motion dynamics, friction, gravity, and other forces interacting with the virtual agent. To account for the increased complexity and achieve computational efficiency, the approach expands a motion tree from the initial state to the goal using discrete abstractions as a guide in a best-first search fashion. Parametrized motion controllers are combined with randomized sampling to enable the motion planner to expand the motion tree along different directions. Comparisons to related work show significant computational speedups.	best-first search;game engine;interaction;motion controller;motion planning;randomized algorithm;sampling (signal processing);simulation;video game developer	Erion Plaku	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34710-8_27	real-time computing;simulation	Robotics	52.159428316640955	-23.153078518610354	194986

76465f58a31860beace27004ad4e5c97be20cd2f	a simplex architecture for hybrid systems using barrier certificates		This paper shows how to use Barrier Certificates (BaCs) to design Simplex Architectures for hybrid systems. The Simplex architecture entails switching control of a plant over to a provably safe Baseline Controller when a safety violation is imminent under the control of an unverified Advanced Controller. A key step of determining the switching condition is identifying a recoverable region, where the Baseline Controller guarantees recovery and keeps the plant invariably safe. BaCs, which are Lyapunov-like proofs of safety, are used to identify a recoverable region. At each time step, the switching logic samples the state of the plant and uses bounded-time reachability analysis to conservatively check whether any states outside the zero-level set of the BaCs, which therefore might be non-recoverable, are reachable in one decision period under control of the Advanced Controller. If so, failover is initiated. Our approach of using BaCs to identify recoverable states is computationally cheaper and potentially more accurate (less conservative) than existing approaches based on state-space exploration. We apply our technique to two hybrid systems: a water tank pump and a stop-sign-obeying controller for a car.	barrier function;baseline (configuration management);computation;failover;hybrid system;lyapunov fractal;obedience (human behavior);reachability;schedule (computer science);state space;two-hybrid screening	Junxing Yang;Md.

One approach is to leverage automatic software verification techniques to establish a performance guarantee. The addition of an environment model and uncertainty in both program and environment, however, means that the state space of a model-checking solution to the problem can be prohibitively large. An approach based on behavior-based controllers in a process-algebra framework that avoids state-space combinatorics is presented here. In this approach, verification of the robot program in the uncertain environment is reduced to a filtering problem for a Bayesian network. Validation results are presented for the verification of a multiple-waypoint and an autonomous exploration robot mission.	autonomous robot;bayesian network;model checking;process calculus;software verification;state space;waypoint	Damian M.

In this topic, bit allocation is crucial since it is directly related with actual bit generation and the coding quality. Meanwhile, the rate-distortion-optimization (RDO) based mode-decision technique also affects performance a lot for the strong relation among mode, bits, and quality. This paper presents a multi-stage rate control scheme for R-D optimized H.264/AVC encoders under CBR video transmission. To enhance the precision of the complexity estimation and bit allocation, a frequency-domain parameter named mean-absolute-transform-difference (MATD) is adopted to represent frame and macroblock (MB) residual complexity. Second, the MATD ratio is utilized to enhance the accuracy of frame layer bit prediction. Then, by considering the bit usage status of whole sequence, a measurement combining forward and backward bit analysis is proposed to adjust the Lagrange multiplier λMODE on frame layer to optimize the mode decision for all MBs within the current frame. On the next stage, bits are allocated on MB layer by proposed remaining complexity analysis. Computed QP is further adjusted according to predicted MB texture bits. Simulation results show the PSNR improvement is up to 1.13dB by using our algorithm, and the stress of output buffer control is also largely released compared with the recommended rate control in H.264/AVC reference software JM13.2.	distortion;encoder;h.264/mpeg-4 avc	Shuijiong Wu;Peilin Liu;Yiqing Huang;Qin Liu;Takeshi Ikenaga	2010	IEICE Transactions		transmission time;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;constant bitrate;rate–distortion optimization;lagrange multiplier;frequency domain	HCI	47.584015498583256	-17.40983225820646	196851
