b1c4d6fca6961435b93cc85432ecd981c750df9d	efficient near-mmse detector for large-scale mimo systems		In this paper, an improved and low-complexity signal detection approach for large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has been proposed. This approach utilizes the preconditioning technique to accelerate the conventional detection algorithm based on Gauss-Seidel (GS) iterative method, and achieves a detection performance close to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection algorithm with relatively small iteration counts. It also outperforms the counterparts based on the Neumann series (NS) expansion and the conjugate gradient (CG) method in poor propagation environments, such as MIMO systems with large loading or correlated factors. The corresponding architecture is also proposed with both novelty and scalability. It takes advantage of the cyclic-shift property of the GS method, and therefore facilitates the hardware implementation. Both numerical results and complexity analysis demonstrate that the proposed detector is efficient and suitable for large-scale MIMO systems.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;circular shift;conjugate gradient method;detection theory;gauss–seidel method;iteration;iterative method;mimo;mean squared error;numerical analysis;preconditioner;roland gs;scalability;software propagation	Zhizhen Wu;Lulu Ge;Xiaohu You;Chuan Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)	10.1109/SiPS.2017.8109988	parallel computing;iterative method;mimo;scalability;detection theory;3g mimo;algorithm;minimum mean square error;detector;conjugate gradient method;computer science	HPC	51.092441120174726	80.83810440362255	145314

RS-OFDM is a combination of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), in which part of the RS code operates as an OFDM front-end. Apart from other advantages such as low peak to average power ratio (PAPR), this scheme benefits mainly from the fact that the overall code is an RS code, leading to optimal performance. This result was obtained previously under the constraint of impulse noise and a fixed integer valued channel. This paper shows that these constraints can be removed by splitting the equalization in two stages: the first stage encompasses a partial equalization in the complex field, which avoids noise amplification. This complex field equalizer also ensures that the residual channel response has integer coefficients. It is calculated using a minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. The residual ISI is removed by a Galois field equalizer in the second stage, posterior to the RS decoding removing the noise. Finally, the performance of the RS-OFDM system is further evaluated by simulations showing the performance gain of the RS-OFDM system compared to a traditional coded OFDM or single carrier with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) scheme.	rayleigh fading;reed–solomon error correction	Geert Van Meerbergen;Marc Moonen;Hugo De Man	2006		10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.48	additive white gaussian noise;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;reed–solomon error correction	Theory	47.153311604747714	77.03617387292002	145362

A nondata-aided(NDA) scheme is considered for the joint timing and phase synchronizer which maximizes the low SNR limit of the likelihood function averaged over the MPSK signal constellation. For this, an EM algorithm is derived which estimates the timing offset and the phase rotations of each subcarrier iteratively and which converges to the true ML estimation of the unknown timing and phase. It is shown that the algorithm becomes independent of the signal-to-noise ratio for both low and high SNR cases. The algorithm is applied to the QPSK modulated OFDM s y s tems and‘it is concluded that for SNR values greater than 10 dB the convergence is achieved in first iteration and for SNR values less than 10 dB, at most in three iterations. It is also concluded that the convergence is independent of the initial starting points.	advanced intrusion detection environment;algorithmic efficiency;decibel;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;modulation;pre-shared key;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;synchronizer (algorithm);utility functions on indivisible goods	Erdal Panayirci	2000		10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881536	expectation–maximization algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Metrics	48.55107143816771	75.33291304585687	145571

Crosstalk cancellation techniques show great potential for enabling the next leap in DSL transmission rates. An important issue is the effect of finite world length on performance. In this paper we provide an analysis of the performance of linear zero-forcing precoders, used for crosstalk compensation, in the presence of quantization noise. We quantify analytically the trade off between quantization level and transmission rate degradation. We demonstrate, through simulations on real lines, the accuracy of our estimates. Finally, we show how to use these estimates as a design tool for DSL linear crosstalk precoders.	crosstalk;design tool;digital subscriber line;elegant degradation;error analysis (mathematics);fixed point (mathematics);interference (communication);nyquist rate;quantization (signal processing);simulation	Amir Leshem;Eitan Sayag;Nikos D.

The distance estimator in the proposed DS-UWB radar accumulates the correlator outputs to average out the noise, and thus, reduces the correlation processing time by shortening the required length of the DS-UWB signal. Numerical results confirm that the proposed DS-UWB radar estimates a distance with a reduced correlation processing time while providing a better estimation performance compared with the conventional DS-UWB radar systems with a distance estimator exploiting the correlations individually.	radar;ultra-wideband	Youngpo Lee;Jaewoo Lee;Youngseok Lee;Jeongyoon Shim;Seokho Yoon	2013	Wireless VITAE 2013	10.1109/VITAE.2013.6617064	continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;telecommunications;passive radar;pulse-doppler radar	HPC	51.08980974616362	77.12878751818084	145866

The basic idea behind this method is a linear precoding scheme applied to data in predefined subcarriers before the inverse discrete Fourier transform to deploy a correlation structure, thus the integer part of the carrier frequency offset can be estimated after the discrete Fourier transform via cross correlation operations among these subcarriers. Performance analysis is carried out to gain insight into the relationship between the false estimation probability and system parameters. Allocation of these predefined subcarriers is optimized to avoid false estimation. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and the performance comparison with the existing estimators.	frequency ambiguity resolution	Weiyang Xu;Xiaolin Fu	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0829-6	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	49.14533393864715	79.59953649402787	146115

By applying spectrum reuse, femtocells can improve the efficiency of spectrum usage. However, since femtocells are deployed by end-users, insufficient coordination between base stations leads to the reuse of the same frequency resources and results in CCI (co-channel interference), which seriously complicates the synchronization problem, particularly in OFDM based systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. In this paper, we investigate the timing synchronization problem in the presence of CCI of an OFDMA macro/femto uplink scenario. We consider the cross-correlation based timing synchronization and propose a pre-filter to mitigate the CCI effect. The simulation results show that this method effectively eliminates the effect of CCI on the cross-correlation based timing synchronization and provides a performance close to that of no CCI case.	coefficient;compaq lte;cross-correlation;interference (communication);kalman filter;lu decomposition;linear algebra;simulation;synchronizer (algorithm);telecommunications link	Jinlin Peng;Pengfei Sun;Li X.

Synchronization is achieved by minimizing the entropy estimated from the eye diagram and the constellation diagram. Key implementation details are addressed toward the realization of entropy-based synchronization algorithms. In addition, the performance is evaluated in controlled conditions. It is shown that, as an alternative to the maximum likelihood criterion, entropy minimization has great potential and offers certain advantages for synchronization in wireless communication, particularly for pulse shaping filters with small excess bandwidth, as well as in multipath fading channels.	algorithm;carrier frequency;diagram;entropy (information theory);multipath propagation;noise shaping;offset binary;pulse shaping	Xiao Liu;Laura Johnson Faherty	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871358	multipath propagation;pulse shaping;minification;synchronization;symbol;distributed computing;carrier signal;computer science;control theory;communication channel;bandwidth (signal processing)	Mobile	47.05260097689212	76.11065932752275	146787

A decision-feedback or a linear equalizer is employed, followed by the differentially coherent detector. The equalizer coefficients are adjusted to minimize the post-detection mean squared error. The error, which is a quadratic function of the equalizer vector, is used to design an adaptive algorithm of stochastic gradient type. The approach differs from those proposed previously, which linearize the post-detection error to enable the use of least mean squares (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive equalizers. The proposed quadratic-error (Q) algorithm has complexity comparable to that of LMS, and equal convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate performance improvement over methods based on linearized-error (L) algorithm. The main advantages of the technique proposed are its simplicity of implementation and robustness to carrier frequency offset, which is maintained for varying modulation level.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive equalizer;carrier frequency offset;carrier recovery;coefficient;coherence (physics);differential phase;equalization (communications);gradient;information sciences institute;interference (communication);key (cryptography);least mean squares filter;mean squared error;modulation;quadratic function;recursion;recursive least squares filter;simulation	M.

However, the partial cancellation tries to reduce the cancellation error in parallel interference cancellation schemes due to the wrong interference estimations in the early stages. Thus, in order to reduce the computational complexity and improve the performacne of the CDMA system, particle swarm optimization (PSO), which has the ability of solution to complex combinatorial optimization problem, is employed in searching the optimal weight for multiple access interference cancellation. Experiments have been carried out on the method can improved on the multiuser detection in CDMA system, the simulation results show that APSO detector can achieve the global optimization in fast convergence rate, and also show that the proposed detector is obviously superior to convenentional receiver and multiuser detectors based on some optimum algorithm in terms of the multiple access interfere and the mitigation of near-far effect.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;computational complexity theory;global optimization;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;rate of convergence;sensor;simulation	Chia-Hsin Cheng;Hsi-Chou Hsu;Yung-Fa Huang;Jyh-Horng Wen;Ling-Cheng Hsu	2010	2010 The 5th Annual ICST Wireless Internet Conference (WICON)		code division multiple access;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;global optimization	EDA	46.80244815014916	76.43856178714913	147642

However, the QS decorrelator is orthogonal to the inflated subspace spanned by the undesired users with arbitrary delays in the QS uncertainty interval and, hence, does not perform as well as a decorrelator with a priori knowledge of the delays. Here, we consider a constrained adaptive linear suppression filter which implicitly estimates the delays of the QS undesired signals, and thus approaches the ideal decorrelator of Lupas and Verdu (1990). For QS-CDMA, it is shown through analysis and simulations that the constrained recursive least-squares (C-RLS) algorithm converges faster than an unconstrained RLS adaptive filter, and generally outperforms the nonadaptive QS decorrelator. A cellular quasi-synchronous system is discussed in the present paper.	multi-user;sensor	Ronald A. Iltis	1998	IEEE Trans.

The proposed algorithm is based on the MBDD algorithm with the introduction of a mechanism for the estimation of the frequency offset. The algorithm is checking N c frequency offsets around zero offset and chooses the one that is the most likely. The analysis shows that the receiver with the proposed algorithm provides signal reception with almost equal quality in a wide range of carrier frequency offsets around zero frequency offset.	carrier frequency;frequency offset	Zorica B.

The key challenge in practical full-duplex systems is uncancelled self-interference signal, which is caused by a combination of hardware and implementation imperfections. Thus, we first present a signal model which captures the effect of significant impairments such as oscillator phase noise, low-noise amplifier noise figure, mixer noise, and analog-to-digital converter quantization noise. Using the detailed signal model, we study the rate gain region, which is defined as the region of received signal-of-interest strength where full-duplex systems outperform half-duplex systems in terms of achievable rate. The rate gain region is derived as a piecewise linear approximation in log-domain, and numerical results show that the approximation closely matches the exact region. Our analysis shows that when phase noise dominates mixer and quantization noise, full-duplex systems can use either active analog cancellation or baseband digital cancellation to achieve near-identical rate gain regions. Finally, as a design example, we numerically investigate the full-duplex system performance and rate gain region in typical indoor environments for practical wireless applications.	analog-to-digital converter;baseband;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);linear approximation;low-noise amplifier;noise figure;numerical analysis;oscillator phase noise;piecewise linear continuation;quantization (signal processing);requirement;systems design;transmitter;zero suppression	Elsayed Ahmed;Ahmed M.

We assume a DLOS multipath MIMO channel with independent CFOs for both the transmitters and receivers. The proposed method consists of two stages. Firstly, with the assumption that only the target transmitter has CFO, while other transmitters don't have CFOs, the multi-dimensional estimation problem is reduced into one dimensional, based on which the new receiver model is deduced and the coarse CFO (CCFO) estimation algorithm is proposed. The residual CFOs are estimated after the equalizer with a multi-stages phase locked loop (MSPLL) approach. Simulation results show that the proposed method works well in the DLOS millimeter wave MIMO systems. There is nearly no performance loss due to the CFO impairments compared with Cramer-Rao bound at high signal to noise ratio (SNR).	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;equalization (communications);mimo;multipath propagation;phase-locked loop;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter	Meng Cai;Rui Lv;Dafeng Tian;Qiao Liu;Kun Li	2014	2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6965821	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory	EDA	50.62543410074225	78.27682896874052	148978

These impairments are unavoidable in any practical implementation and severely degrade the obtainable link performance. In this contribution, we study the joint impact of frequency-selective I/Q imbalance at both transmitter and receiver together with channel distortions and CFO error. Two estimation and compensation structures based on different pilot patterns are proposed for coping with such impairments. The first structure is based on preamble pilot pattern while the second one assumes a sparse pilot pattern. The proposed estimation/compensation structures are able to separate the individual impairments, which are then compensated in the reverse order of their appearance at the receiver. We present time-domain estimation and compensation algorithms for receiver I/Q imbalance and CFO and propose low-complexity algorithms for the compensation of channel distortions and transmitter IQ imbalance. The performance of the compensation algorithms is investigated with computer simulations as well as with practical radio frequency (RF) measurements. The performance results indicate that the proposed techniques provide close to the ideal performance both in simulations and measurements.

In the proposed scheme, a weight is imposed on each discrete OFDM signal via a certain kind of a bandlimited signal, and an OFDM signal formed with the weighted discrete data is then considered before a high power amplifier (HPA), whereas the original signal can be recovered completely at the receiver side. Meanwhile, the time duration needed to transmit the weighted OFDM signal is the same as the time duration for the original OFDM signal. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated with computer simulations. According to numerical results, the PAPR of the weighted OFDM signal is smaller than that of the clipping and filtering (C&F) method, and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the weighted OFDM system is improved compared with the C&F method. Here, the proposed method is simpler than the C&F method.	audio power amplifier;bandlimiting;bit error rate;computer simulation;discrete mathematics;distortion;finite element method;multiplexing;numerical analysis;power architecture platform reference;x.690	Chang Eon Shin;Kyung Soo Rim;Youngok Kim	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2232949	fourier transform;electronic engineering;pascal;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;convolution;wireless	Visualization	47.53725457425436	80.73995262795938	149546

Using only the spreading code of the user of interest and the received data, adaptive techniques are proposed that blindly identify the impulse response of the multipath channel. In particular, we develop RLS and LMS implementations that exhibit rapid convergence combined with low computational complexity. Both versions were inspired by the iterative power method used in numerical analysis to compute the singular vector corresponding to the largest singular value of a matrix. This is the reason why our schemes exhibit performance comparable to SVD off-line techniques while outperforming, significantly, existing adaptive methods proposed in the literature.	algorithm;channel state information;computational complexity theory;download;iterative method;least mean squares filter;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;online and offline;power iteration;recursive least squares filter;simulation;singular value decomposition	Xenofon G.

Crosstalk originates from signals transmitted on nearby pairs in a telephone cable, and couples over unknown pair-to-pair crosstalk coupling channels into the pair carrying the signal. While crosstalk is generally the dominant impairment for current DSL systems, only recently have papers appeared addressing the problem of multiuser crosstalk channel estimation [1], [2]. In [2], it was proposed to identify crosstalk sources by finding the maximum correlation with a “basis set” (dictionary) of representative measured coupling functions. It is shown here that this can be considered equivalent to finding an optimal sparse representation of a vector from an overcomplete set of vectors. A well-known algorithm that solves this problem is the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm [4], a greedy algorithm for choosing a subset of vectors from an overcomplete dictionary and finding a linear combination of that subset which approximates a given signal vector. A method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for reducing the size of the dictionary is also discussed.	basis set (chemistry);channel state information;crosstalk;dictionary;digital subscriber line;greedy algorithm;matching pursuit;multi-user;singular value decomposition;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;telephone line	Stefano Galli;Robert Hausman;Kenneth J.

When parametric designs are employed, elements of an impairment or data covariance matrix must be computed as part of equalizer weight calculation. The conventional approach is to express these elements in terms of path delays and path coefficients. This approach requires a significant amount of computation, and performance is sensitive to errors in the path delay estimates. In this paper, an alternative approach is developed, based on directly estimating net channel coefficients corresponding to an extended set of delays that includes the tap or finger delays of the equalizer. This avoids the need for path delay estimates, improving robustness. Also, the elements of the impairment or data covariance can be expressed in terms of efficiently computed convolutions of these net channel coefficients, even though these elements correspond to correlations of cyclostationary interference. Complexity estimates are used to show computational savings, and performance simulations are used to show gains in robustness.	computation;convolution;cyclostationary process;dispersive partial differential equation;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;hamiltonian path;interference (communication);path coefficient;r language;simulation	Douglas A.

The proposed method sets a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detection result to the starting point. From this point, MSCS searches for signal candidates in multi-dimensions of the noise enhancement from which the MMSE detection suffers. In the search, some streams of the signal candidates are fixed at constellation points. Among the obtained signal candidates, the detected signal is selected as the one that minimizes the log likelihood function. Furthermore, this paper proposes stream selection-MSCS (S-MSCS) that selects the constrained streams under the criterion of small equivalent amplitudes of channels caused by the MMSE detection. Setting the number of patterns of constrained streams to just one can reduce complexity, and selecting the constrained streams on the basis of the equivalent amplitude can maintain excellent BER performance. Computer simulations under 8 × 8 MIMO channel conditions with 16QAM demonstrate that S-MSCS can maintain only 0.5 dB degradation of the average BER performance from the maximum likelihood detection (MLD), while reducing the computational complexity to about one third of that of QR decomposition with M algorithm (QRM)-MLD.	algorithm;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;detection theory;elegant degradation;mimo;mean squared error;microsoft cluster server;qr decomposition;x.690	Katsuya Kato;Kazuhiko Fukawa;Ryota Yamada;Hiroshi Suzuki;Naoki Okamoto	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6884016	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Robotics	48.78481218588077	78.28528042855515	150722

The proposed method exploits the training symbols in VDSL initialization using an eigen approach. Unlike earlier eigen based TEQ designs, the proposed method does not require the channel impulse response. The TEQ can be obtained by computing an eigenvector of a positive definite matrix that depends only on the averaged received VDSL symbols. Examples are given to demonstrate that the proposed TEQ design method can effectively shorten the channel impulse response, and achieve very good bit rates with only a small number of training symbols.	eigen (c++ library);equalization (communications);interference (communication);semiconductor industry	Yuan-Pei Lin;Li-Han Liang;Pei-Ju Chung;See-May Phoong	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465299	electronic engineering;speech recognition;digital subscriber line;design methods;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;frequency domain	Embedded	48.1659930047894	78.6778182533386	151322
2d591b164ec73163ac1933944014e787064d0cfb	robust clock timing recovery for performance improvement in digital self-synchronous ofdm receivers		Due to constraints of cost and size for mobile devices, a digital self-synchronous OFDM receiver is preferable in mobile applications since it only requires economical crystal oscillators plus free-running analog front-end circuits. However, there are more stringent requirements for clock timing recovery tasks in such a self-synchronous receiver. This paper presents an efficient and robust clock timing recovery scheme for the digital self-synchronous OFDM receiver. It is based on the canonical Gardner structure, but new techniques are devised for performance improvement. A joint iterative estimation algorithm is used for error detection, which can not only improve the detection precision, but also maintain the loop’s dynamic performance. A direct control method based on a simple dynamic delay technique instead of the numerical-controlled oscillator mechanism is adopted to smoothly adjust the timing recovery by adaptively performing asynchronous resampling on the discrete sequence of the received signal. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results are also presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed clock timing recovery scheme and conduct performance analysis and evaluation.	algorithm;analog front-end;carrier recovery;computer simulation;crystal oscillator;error detection and correction;iterative method;mobile app;mobile device;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;real-time clock;requirement;resampling (statistics);sampling (signal processing);smoothing	Xingbo Hu;Weiyang Xu;Yinghong Tian	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3792-9	clock synchronization;real-time computing;asynchronous communication;computer simulation;computer science;error detection and correction;timing failure;digital clock manager;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;static timing analysis	EDA	51.53972635879683	77.84833656060538	151708

The study analyzes first the mean square error for the estimation of the covariance matrix of the received symbols. We prove that, for high and medium signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the estimation error in the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix exhibits a lower error than that in the off-diagonal elements. This behavior holds for SNR values in digital communication. Contrary to general belief, we prove that the diagonal of this matrix can be used for channel estimation. Hence, we develop a novel algorithm that utilizes this result. We also develop a low-complexity version that provides acceptable results with reduced computational requirements. Finally, we analyze the covariance matrix and propose another new algorithm with noise suppression capabilities. Some experimental results for Rayleigh channels are included to support these conclusions. In addition, they illustrate better performance of the new methods, compared with previous proposals and with the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB).	algorithm;channel state information;computation;mean squared error;multiplexing;rayleigh–ritz method;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;zero suppression	Francisco J.

To estimate and control a threshold level in the noncoherent IR-UWB receiver, it uses binary output of the 1-bit ADC instead of energy level of received signals using a high resolution ADC, which reduces hardware complexity of the receiver. Theoretical performance evaluation and computer simulation demonstrates that the performance of the proposed algorithm is similar to that of theoretically optimum one.

c451e1b995bcaad02b8f68ed566ac2b106696faf	a low-complexity algorithm for ofdm phase noise estimation		Phase noise compensation plays an indispensable role in realizing the potential of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for high-data-rate communications. Due to various heuristics employed to deal with the particular properties of phase noise, the existing approaches are still performance-limited in terms of accuracy and computational cost. In this paper, we focus on channel estimation stage and formulate the problem of phase noise compensation in the time domain. An efficient algorithm is devised using the majorization-minimization technique with guaranteed convergence. Numerical results with phase noise generated as a Wiener process demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is able to provide substantially improved phase noise and channel estimates with lower mean squared error especially for moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The computational complexity is also much lower than that of the benchmark.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;benchmark (computing);channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;frequency divider;heuristic (computer science);mean squared error;multiplexing;numerical analysis;numerical method;phase noise;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;wiener filter	Zhongju Wang;Prabhu Babu;Daniel Pérez Palomar	2017	2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227809	phase noise;mathematical optimization;algorithm;wiener process;computer science;computational complexity theory;time domain;heuristics;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mean squared error;communication channel	EDA	50.894749201459724	81.3181834259695	154028

A simple and low-complex method is proposed to suppress ICI by windowing the received signal using Franks window coefficients in time domain and combining the extended signal interval which was not interfered by multipath to the corresponding information part of the cyclic-prefix (cp) based OFDM system. The ICI are suppressed by equivalently reducing the channel time-variation according to the useful extended signal interval. If the channel time-variation is linear in one OFDM symbol and the useful extended signal interval period as long as the information part period, the equivalent channel time-variation of information part will turn into a constant which means no ICI occurs. And then, a N-point fast Fourier-transform (FFT) and one-tap equalizer is used for demodulation and channel equalization. The complexity of the proposed method is only N log N. The analysis of Franks window coefficients for equivalent channel mitigation in linear time-varying channel are investigated and simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed method.	coefficient;doppler effect;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;ici (programming language);multipath propagation;simulation;time complexity;variation of information	Kun-Yi Lin;Hsin-Piao Lin;Ming-Chien Tseng;Chorng-Ren Sheu	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394500	fast fourier transform;telecommunications;computer science;control theory	Embedded	48.67854629861396	78.82604083795756	154122

To mitigate the CFO problems in multiuser environment, an inter-carrier-interference- cancellation-based (ICI-cancellation-based) CFO estimator is proposed. The proposed CFO estimator measures energy dispersion of data compensated by ICI cancellation and channel equalization. With measured energy dispersion, correct CFOs can be obtained by running an iterative search. Compared with other designs, the proposed CFO estimator is more robust in transmission conditions and types of subcarrier allocations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transceiver outperforms others in mean-square-error (MSE) and bit-error- rate (BER) performance.	baseband;bit error rate;carrier frequency offset;download;frequency divider;ici (programming language);iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multi-user;multipath propagation;performance evaluation;simulation;subcarrier;systems design;telecommunications link;transceiver;uncompressed video;x.690	Jung-Mao Lin;Hsi-Pin Ma;Pangan Ting	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.816	wimax;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;equalization;mean squared error;computer network;transceiver;broadband networks	Visualization	49.01017589584406	78.05940860015889	154505

1e0bfe7a73ed9c1ed51f1793a677fb0858d5b477	joint aod, aoa, and channel estimation for mimo-ofdm systems		Beamforming with antenna arrays has been considered as an enabling technology in future wireless communication systems. To conduct beamforming, one has to know the angle-of-departure (AoD) or angle-of-arrival (AoA). For data detection, the receiver also has to know channel response. In this paper, we propose a new joint AoD, AoA, and channel estimation scheme for pilot-assisted multiple-input-multiple-output–orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. First, a compressive-sensing technique is employed to estimate the channel impulse response, exploiting the sparsity property of wireless channels. Then, AoA and AoD are jointly estimated for each detected path by the maximum likelihood method. The Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) is also derived and a transmit beamforming scheme is proposed accordingly. In the scenario of available prior information, a maximum a posteriori estimation is proposed. The Bayesian CRLB (BCRLB) for the problem is also derived and a transmit beamforming scheme is further proposed. It turns out that only two training OFDM symbols are required for the estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can approach the CRLB/BCRLB in both scenarios and achieve the same spectral efficiency as that obtained with the ideal channel in millimeter-wave communications.	angle of arrival;beamforming;channel state information;compressed sensing;estimation theory;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;simulation;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency	Chih-Yu Chen;Wen-Rong Wu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2798360	electronic engineering;impulse response;maximum a posteriori estimation;beamforming;mimo-ofdm;cramér–rao bound;computer science;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;communication channel;spectral efficiency	Mobile	50.55769381782535	80.00075348112183	155044

We evaluate the receiver complexities of the PIC receivers employing the advanced removal scheme. The proposed structure has significantly lower complexity as compared with that of the existing schemes. We analyze the effects of timing error, oversampling rate, unsynchronized users and/or outer-cell interference, and quantization error on the PIC performance through extensive computer simulations.

Multipath propagation significantly influences the ToA estimate, resulting in position errors. To mitigate these errors, the multipath channel needs to be accurately estimated, usually with a large number of known pilot symbols. A tradeoff between the data rate and the multipath channel estimation performance must be made for joint communication and positioning applications. This paper proposes a semiblind range tracking algorithm, which allows the reduction of the required number of pilot symbols significantly. For moving receivers, the algorithm needs, only in the beginning, an OFDM symbol with known pilot symbols, which increases the data rate dramatically. Instead of tracking the complex amplitude of individual subcarriers, the proposed algorithm directly tracks the multipath channel parameters, including the complex amplitude, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA) of individual multipath components. The estimated delay of the first arrived path, i.e., its ToA, is used to calculate the range between the transmitter and receiver antennas. Evaluations of the algorithm are provided by simulations in an artificial scenario and using channel sounder measurement data. The results show that the proposed tracking algorithm can effectively track the range between transmitter and receiver and detect the data.	algorithm;angle of arrival;channel state information;data rate units;fisher information;formation matrix;in the beginning... was the command line;iteration;iterative method;kalman filter;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;multiplexing;phasor;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;subcarrier;time of arrival;transmitter	Wei Wang;Thomas Jost;Christian Gentner;Siwei Zhang;Armin Dammann	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2468079	estimation;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;noise;delay spread;mathematics;multiplexing;statistics	Mobile	50.908012437498485	79.64820766970371	155169

It is known that when the cyclic prefix is no shorter than the channel impulse response (CIR), the DMT system is IS1 free. For channels with very long CIR such as DSL loops, a time-domain equalizer (TEQ) is typically added at the receiver to shorten the effective impulse response. This paper proposes a filterbank approach to the design of TEQ for maximizing the bit rate. Moreover we introduce a structure of DMT system with multiple TEQs. The optimal solution for multiple TEQs is given in closed form and it can serve as a theoretical upper bound for all other TEQs. From the multiple TEQ structure, we propose a DMT system with a pair of complex conjugating TEQs. Simulation examples are given to verify the merit of the proposed TEQ.	committed information rate;digital monetary trust;digital subscriber line;equalization (communications);filter bank;hmg infosec standard no.1;simulation;transceiver	Chun-Yang Chen;See-May Phoong	2003		10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1205767	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;impulse response;time domain;computer science;engineering;upper and lower bounds;transient response;data transmission;transceiver	Mobile	48.2350623793663	77.76231074649152	155309

In this paper, we describe the transfer functions (including all temporal and spatial interference terms) by polynomial matrices. The equalisation of this system can then be performed by a proposed polynomial matrix pseudo-inverse. Some numerical examples for this approach are presented.		Amr A. A.

OFDM channel estimation with simultaneous phase noise compensation has therefore drawn much attention and stimulated continuing efforts. Existing methods, however, either have not taken into account the fundamental properties of phase noise or are only able to provide estimates of limited applicability owing to considerable computational complexity. In this paper, we have reformulated the joint phase noise and channel estimation problem in the time domain as opposed to existing frequency-domain approaches, which enables us to develop much more efficient algorithms using the majorization–minimization technique. In addition, we propose two methods based on dimensionality reduction and regularization, respectively, that can adapt to various phase noise levels and signal-to-noise ratio and achieve much lower estimation errors than the benchmarks without incurring much additional computational cost. Several numerical examples with phase noise generated by free-running oscillators or phase-locked loops demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform existing methods with respect to both computational efficiency and mean squared error within a large range of SNRs.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;dimensionality reduction;mean squared error;multiplexing;numerical analysis;phase noise;phase-locked loop;signal-to-noise ratio	Zhongju Wang;Prabhu Babu;Daniel Pérez Palomar	2017	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2017.2691672	phase noise;frequency domain;mathematical optimization;dimensionality reduction;noise measurement;time domain;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science;multiplexing;communication channel	EDA	50.973152017097135	81.31582042956582	155840

The performance of OFDM is severely degraded by the presence of impulsive noise caused due to different nonlinear devices and power amplifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel automated framework to detect and remove impulse noise in OFDM system. The proposed method is based on sparse decomposition and \(l_1\)-norm optimization algorithm of the received signal over an over-complete matrix composed of both sine and cosine waveforms and time-shifted impulse waveforms. By proper construction of the over-complete matrix, the impulse removal and symbol decoding have been performed simultaneously. Thus, it can reduce the computational complexity. Our method does not require any assumption about the location and magnitude of the impulse and does not demand pilot symbols or null subcarriers unlike other existing methods. Thus, the proposed method is blind in nature. The method is evaluated using different levels of impulse noise and signal-to-noise ratios varying from 0 to 20 dB. Preliminary evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparse representation with the proposed dictionaries in effectively removing the impulse noise and improving the bit error rate under different noise levels.	sparse	Titir Dutta;Udit Satija;Barathram Ramkumar;M.

Our contributions are in designing an optimal preamble, and the corresponding estimator, to closely achieve the minimum Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the CFO. This optimality is asserted with respect to a novel class of preambles, referred to as block-rotated preambles (BRPs). This class includes the periodic preamble that is used widely in practice, yet this class provides an additional degree of design freedom via a block rotation angle. We first identify the catastrophic scenario of an arbitrarily large CRB when a conventional periodic preamble is used. We next resolve this problem by using a BRP with a non-zero block rotation angle. This angle creates, in effect, an artificial frequency offset that separates the desired relayed signal from the self-interference that is introduced in the AF protocol. With appropriate optimization, the CRB incurs only marginal loss from one-way relaying under practical channel conditions. To facilitate implementation, a specific low-complexity class of estimators is examined, and conditions for the estimators to achieve the optimized CRB are established. Numerical results corroborate with theoretical findings.	anisotropic filtering;carrier frequency offset;complexity class;interference (communication);marginal model;mathematical optimization;numerical method;one-way function	Chin Keong Ho;Patrick Ho Wang Fung;Sumei Sun	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.121208	telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Mobile	49.84529318584958	77.42263571042845	156685

The main advantage of the proposed scheme is that it uses directly the spreading codes instead of the cross-correlation matrix and thus does not require the calculation of the crosscorrelation matrix (requires 2NK2 floating point operations (flops), where N is the processing gain and K is the number of users) which reduces significantly the overall computational complexity. Thus it is suitable for long-code CDMA systems such as IS-95 and UMTS where the cross-correlation matrix is changing every symbol. We study the convergence behavior of the proposed scheme using two approaches and prove that it converges to the decorrelator detector if the over-relaxation factor is in the interval ]0, 2[. Simulation results are in excellent agreement with theory.	code;computational complexity theory;cross-correlation;flops;interference (communication);iteration;linear programming relaxation;multi-user;process gain;simulation;successive over-relaxation	Abdelouahab Bentrcia;Azzedine Zerguine;Moussa Benyoucef	2007	EURASIP J.

This results in higher spectral efficiency relative to an equivalent optical-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM) delivering the same data rate. O-SEFDM technique can save spectrums in both the electrical and optical domains. However, due to the loss of orthogonality, detection of O-SEFDM signals becomes more complicated. In this work, we employ a hybrid soft Iterative Detection (ID) together with fixed sphere decoder (FSD), concurrently optimizing performance and complexity. We show that for Bandwidth Compression Factor (BCF) of up to 25 percent, we can achieve the same performance as O-OFDM. This verifies Mazo's rates of transmission 25 percent faster than the Nyquist rate. We report a 4QAM system occupying approximately the same bandwidth as that of an 8QAM with 1.6 dB improved error performance for the same transmission rate. The same system shows only minor power penalty (1 dB) relative to its 4QAM OFDM bit rate equivalent but with the advantage of 30% bandwidth saving. This study reports1 optical and electrical bandwidth saving with minor error performance degradation and paves the way for practical.	data rate units;elegant degradation;finite difference method;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;nyquist rate;spectral efficiency	Izzat Darwazeh;Tongyang Xu;Tao Gui;Yuan Bao;Zhaohui Li	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883852	telecommunications;optical performance monitoring	Mobile	47.782146805911154	80.44669523009082	158543

In addition, a novel null steering scheme for large arrays by perturbing only a few elements is presented. To achieve this goal, compressed sensing (CS) is used to exploit the sparsity of the perturbed elements. The advantages of the proposed scheme are a significant reduction in hardware cost and lower power consumption, as well as less aging of the elements and faster response. Simulation results show that the CS-based method could be efficiently used to generate wide nulls using at least two elements. The interference rejection ratio achieved by the proposed method is 10-20 dB better than the existing solutions. The performance of different null generation methods in terms of peak-to-sidelobe ratio, pointing error, and beam-width is compared as well. The proposed algorithm is a prominent solution for the future 5G base stations, where a fast and low-cost beam shaping algorithm is required.	algorithm;compressed sensing;interference (communication);noise shaping;rejection sampling;simulation;sparse matrix	Mahdi Khosravi;Mohammad Fakharzadeh;Mohammad Hassan Bastani	2016	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2016.2580587	telecommunications;computer science;interference;compressed sensing;beamforming	EDA	49.343340542194355	81.46918383917351	158751

However, similar to SISO-OFDM, MIMO-OFDM suffers significant performance degradation due to the presence of phase noise. Many methods have been developed to mitigate phase noise for a single antenna system with perfect channel estimation, whereas none has been proposed for correlated MIMO-OFDM scenarios. Therefore, in this letter, by using the phase noise correlation function, a new phase noise mitigation scheme is proposed for the general M/sub T//spl times/M/sub R/ MIMO WLANs system with channel estimation errors. Numerical results show that, compared with conventional approaches, the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gain with high spectral efficiency, requiring few pilots, and is robust to spatial correlation and channel estimation errors, which makes it very attractive for practical applications.	channel state information;elegant degradation;mimo;mimo-ofdm;phase noise;soft-in soft-out decoder;spectral efficiency	Pan Liu;Songping Wu;Yeheskel Bar-Ness	2006	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2006.1603364	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;statistics	Mobile	48.58291611856864	79.48489783407362	158828

At each symbol interval, a decision algorithm first makes a primary data estimate based on the constrained linear MMSE criterion. Then the new primary data estimate along with the few previous ones is used by subsequent MMSE channel estimation. Finally a linear equalizer is adapted to recover the data on a symbol-by-symbol basis, which is therefore suitable for wireless relay systems. The error performance is evaluated by simulation using the estimated signal MMSE and BER as metrics, and is very promising.	algorithm;channel state information;data recovery;equalization (communications);relay;simulation;x.690	S.

In this paper, we firstly propose to use a Gaussian model based MMSE detection algorithm to implement MMSE-PIC with low complexity. This algorithm, which can detect a length-Nr received data block by a single Hermitian matrix (sized Nt × Nt) inversion, is especially preferable in Massive MIMO up-link applications where the number of transmit antennas Nt from each end terminal is much less than the number of receive antennas Nr in the Base Station. Then we derive a new method to calculate the matrix inversion by a linear combination of two matrices, which reduces the complexity from O(Nt3) to O(Nt2). At last, in order to improve the system performance for the first pass when there is no a priori information available, a self-iteration method is proposed and thus a system performance gain of 1dB to 2dB is achieved at the cost of modest complexity increase.	algorithm;bit error rate;download;interference (communication);iteration;mimo;mean squared error;soft-in soft-out decoder;telecommunications link;the matrix;x.690	Licai Fang;Lu Xu;Qinghua Guo;Defeng Huang;Sven Nordholm	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178509	complexity;iteration;computer science;theoretical computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;silicon;low;mimo;modulation	Robotics	47.35284881351257	77.18432025833735	159104

Hence, the algorithm can be considered as asymptotically optimal for the employed feature vector when the channel matrix and noise variance are known. Both the case with perfect channel knowledge and the practically more relevant case with blind channel estimation are considered. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides a good classification performance while exhibiting a significantly lower computational complexity when compared with conventional algorithms.	advanced mezzanine card;asymptotically optimal algorithm;channel state information;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;feature vector;long-running transaction;mimo;modulation;spatial multiplexing;window of opportunity	Michael S.

Channel estimation in time domain is considered in this paper because it has earlier been confirmed that if the number of OFDM subcarriers exceed the number of channel taps, as the case is in most practical OFDM based systems, the time domain channel estimate is more accurate than the channel estimation in frequency domain. The performance of the proposed adaptive algorithms based-time domain iterative channel estimators are validated in comparison with the LMS-based channel estimator proposed earlier in literature.	adaptive algorithm;channel state information;interleaving (disk storage);iterative method;least mean squares filter;methods of computing square roots;subcarrier	Olutayo Oyeyemi Oyerinde;Stanley H.

It is based on the modification of Tone Reservation method and suits for big number of subcarriers: 1024-32768. It is proposed to use a small part of the frequency band gain obtained by SEFDM signals to reduce PAPR with no need to send side information to receiver. In the proposed algorithm additional subcarriers for PAPR reduction are equally spaced over the signal bandwidth with randomly generated different combinations of manipulation symbols. The PAPR reduction in average is of 1.8 dB for 840 subcarriers, and 1.2 dB for 27841 subcarriers. The degree of reduction of the PAPR depends on the amount of additional subcarrier channel alphabet and on the number of attempts of generation of additional subcarrier symbol combinations. Complexity issues for the proposed PAPR reduction algorithm are also considered: simple low additional resource approach based on reduced size IFFT blocks is recommended.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);computational complexity theory;decibel;fast fourier transform;frequency band;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;procedural generation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier	Evgeny O.

By reduction of error propagation, our scheme significantly improves BER performance, especially under mobile channel conditions whilst keeping the computational complexity low for efficient implementation. The latter is achieved by explicitly excluding channel decoding in the IIC loop and applying the equalization step completely in the frequency domain. We evaluate the enhanced IIC for fast Rayleigh fading channels and use the FFT block size as a design factor to reduce Doppler induced inter-carrier interference. The above considerations allow for a competitive trade-off between performance and computational complexity.	adobe framemaker;block size (cryptography);carrier frequency;committed information rate;computation;computational complexity theory;doppler effect;fast fourier transform;fault tolerance;hybrid drive;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;matthews correlation coefficient;overhead (computing);propagation of uncertainty;radio resource management;rayleigh fading;software propagation;while;x.690	Martin Fritz;Rana H.

However, this is not true in most practical situations and, in order to avoid the serious performance degradation that occurs when the CIR length is underestimated, a channel with """"more than enough"""" taps is usually considered. This very frequently leads to overestimating the channel order, which increases the computational complexity of any maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) algorithm, while degrading its performance at the same time. The problem of estimating a single channel order for a time and frequency selective MIMO channel has recently been tackled. However, this is an idealized approach, since a MIMO channel comprises multiple subchannels (as many as the number of inputs times that of the outputs), each of them possibly with its own order. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for MLSD that incorporates the full estimation of the MIMO CIR parameters, including one channel order per output. The proposed technique is based on the per survivor processing (PSP) methodology, it admits both blind and semiblind implementations, depending on the availability of pilot data, and it is designed to work with time-selective channels. Besides the analytical derivation of the algorithm, we provide computer simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the resulting receiver."""	algorithm;committed information rate;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;digital subchannel;elegant degradation;error floor;mimo;trellis quantization;x.690	Manuel A.

However, the original LLL algorithm has variable complexity, which is not desirable in hardware implementation. To solve this problem, some fixed-complexity LLL (fcLLL) algorithms have recently been proposed by using the fixed-column traverse strategy with limited number of LLL iterations. The existing fcLLL algorithms are designed to process each column with equal priority, which is not optimized in terms of error performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fcLLL algorithm with a novel column traverse strategy by allocating priorities to columns based on the characteristics of LLL and MIMO detection. In addition, we propose an improved termination criterion without sacrificing the error performance in the proposed fcLLL algorithm. Simulations show that our proposed fcLLL algorithm converges faster than LLL and existing fcLLL algorithms, and yields better error performance than the LLL and existing fcLLL algorithms when the maximum number of LLL iterations is fixed. Furthermore, in large MIMO systems, our proposed fcLLL algorithm exhibits significant complexity advantage, saving about 90% LLL iterations in average compared to the existing fcLLL algorithms for a 128× 128 MIMO system with 64-QAM.	arjen lenstra;column (database);computer simulation;iteration;lr parser;lattice reduction;lenstra–lenstra–lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm;mimo;sensor;simplified instructional computer;traverse	Qingsong Wen;Qi Zhou;Xiaoli Ma	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037304	database index;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;detector;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;mimo	EDA	47.64636777677847	77.5609129112948	160718

In subspace-based algorithms, construction of the signal or noise subspace is an important issue. Different to other subspace-based approaches exploiting the signal or noise subspace from cyclic prefix, virtual subcarriers, or oversampling techniques, we develop a blind channel estimation algorithm by establishing noise subspace from time-domain real symbols, which can be obtained by using the conjugate-symmetric property of OFDM symbols in frequency-domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional subspace-based channel estimation algorithms in mean-squared error.	algorithm;channel state information;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;imaginary time;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;modulation;oversampling;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;stacking;subcarrier	Shih-Hao Fang;Ju-Ya Chen;Ming-Der Shieh;Jing-Shiun Lin	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493810	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;frequency domain	EDA	49.05816839367955	78.76097355762329	160949

Simple detectors have low complexity and power consumption, but the performance is worse than with more complex detectors. Therefore the detector can be adapted to suit the channel conditions to minimize the power consumption while satisfying the quality of service requirements. The performances of the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detector and the K-best list sphere detector (LSD) in a long term evolution (LTE) system are compared. We also investigate least squares (LS) channel estimation performance with different mobile speeds and correlation scenarios. Theoretical complexities of the detectors are also given. In the 4 × 4 system, high order modulation and bad channel estimate impacts the performance of the K-best detector, resulting it to be outperformed by the LMMSE detector. In the 8 × 8 case, the K-best LSD outperforms the LMMSE detector, since the channel conditions are more challenging for the LMMSE detector.	channel state information;compaq lte;frequency divider;least squares;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;non-functional requirement;performance;sensor;uncompressed video	Essi Suikkanen;Johanna Ketonen;Markku J.

The multiple CFOs result from independent local oscillators at each basestation (BS), and cause accumulation of phase errors that compromise beamforming accuracy. Using previously devised multiple CFO estimation techniques for simultaneously transmitted training sequences in a non-fading channel, we begin by examining the effects of fading on a linear channel state estimate. An example illustrates that a fade rate threshold can be defined after which linear channel estimation is infeasible. Because of the dependence of the CFO estimators on the CSI estimate, this threshold applies to the CFO estimates as well. As a way to combat the channel variation, the maximum likelihood metric is modified to accommodate a parameterized fading channel estimate.	autocorrelation matrix;beamforming;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;instability;mimo;telecommunications link;tree accumulation	Brad W.

Because the orthogonality between subcarriers is destroyed, the conventional way to combat the inter-carrier interference (ICI) is employing the banded minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer, which can save computational efforts introduced by a large number of subcarriers. However, the width of the banded channel matrix is mainly determined by the normalized Doppler frequency in the sense that with the high Doppler frequency the complexity of equalization for one OFDM block will significantly increase with the band width D. In order to reduce the equalization complexity, the authors proposedmulti-segmental OFDM signal equalization method with piecewise linear model (PLM) to approximate the time variations and mitigate the corresponding ICI. Its complexity is significantly reduced with the small segments. Furthermore, an alternative MMSE method with the iterative rank-1 matrix updates is proposed to further reduce the complexity. We also derive the theoretical pre-equalized and equalized signal to interference ratio (SIR) for different normalized Doppler frequencies and segment numbers, which implies that the larger segment number can achieve the better performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional banded MMSE equalizer and the partial fast Fourier transform (FFT) method in terms of bit error rate (BER) with almost the same complexity.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;channel (communications);equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;linear model;mean squared error;multiplexing;piecewise linear continuation;simulation;subcarrier;x.690	Li Alex Li;Hua Wei;Yao Yao;Gong Chen;Weiwei Ling;Jiang Du;Yao Huang	2017	EURASIP J.

In this paper, a new synchronization algorithm for STBC MIMO-OFDM system at low SNR is proposed. Firstly, a set of imaginary orthogonal complementary sequences with a set of imaginary complementary sequence sets and orthogonal matrix is constructed, and the proper length of the imaginary orthogonal complementary sequences is obtained by extending the sequences through transforming orthogonal matrix. Secondly, in order to improve the sequences’ auto-correlation and cross-correlation, the training sequences are constructed with their minus conjugates, and then superimposed on data signals. Finally, good synchronization is obtained by cross-correlation operation between the training sequences and data signals at the receiver. The integer frequency offset is estimated to be e 2 1⁄2 N=4;N=4 . Theoretical analysis and simulation prove that this synchronization algorithm achieves precise timing synchronization, wider frequency offset range and lower computational complexity at low SNR than conventional algorithm.	algorithm;autocorrelation;code;complementary sequences;computational complexity theory;cross-correlation;frequency offset;imaginary time;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;quaternions and spatial rotation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Ren-Ze Luo;Jiao Yang;Guolin He;Wenchang Cao	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3457-8	real-time computing;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	48.44054780297794	78.73062930947968	163246

The paper proposes a time reversal UWA communication method combined with a symbol-based Doppler compensation (SBDC) technique to solve those problems. A single element time reversal mirror (TRM) is used to realize channel equalization and mitigate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) resulting from multipath propagation. The SBDC technique is subsequently used to compensate Doppler effects in the received signal, thereby reducing the bit error rate (BER) and improving the communication performance. In order to verify the performance of the proposed communication method, some simulations with real sounding channels were performed. Moreover, a field UWA communication experiment was conducted in the Songhua River (Harbin, China). The UWA communication experiment achieves nearly error-free performance with a communication rate of 100 bit/s in the bandwidth of 2 kHz. The results of the experiment demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed UWA communication method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;ant venoms;automatic sounding;bit error rate;broadcast delay;conflict (psychology);doppler echocardiography;doppler effect;experiment;federal enterprise architecture;information sciences institute;interference (communication);kilohertz;manuscripts;multipath propagation;name;natural science disciplines;neurofibromatosis 2;pressure sensor device component;pressure ulcer;pulse-doppler radar;real-time clock;simulation;software propagation;t-symmetry;time reversal signal processing;transplant-related mortality;x.690	AnBang Zhao;Caigao Zeng;Juan Hui;Lin Ma;Xuejie Bi	2018		10.3390/s18103279	electronic engineering;doppler effect;symbol;underwater;engineering;sound pressure	Mobile	53.75201470803926	79.65863240445573	163690

Unlike the conventional maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method which needs the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, NMLD method has no need of CSI at either the transmitter or receiver. After repartitioning the observation block of multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) and following a decision feedback process, the decision metric of NMLD is derived by reforming that of MSDD. Since the maximum Doppler frequency and noise power are included in the derived decision metric, estimations of both maximum Doppler frequency and noise power are needed at the receiver for NMLD. A fast calculation algorithm (FCA) is applied to reduce the computational complexity of NMLD. The feasibility of the proposed NMLD is demonstrated by computer simulations in both slow and fast fading environments. Simulation results show that the proposed NMLD has good bit error rate (BER) performance, approaching that of the conventional coherent MLD with the extension of reference symbols interval. It is also proved that the BER performance is not sensitive to the estimation errors in maximum Doppler frequency and noise power. key words: noncoherent maximum likelihood detection, spatial multiplexing, MIMO, multiple-symbol differential detection, fast calculation algorithm	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;coherence (physics);computational complexity theory;computer simulation;fast fourier transform;formal concept analysis;mimo;noise power;spatial multiplexing;transmitter;x.690	Ziyan Jia;Katsunobu Yoshii;Shiro Handa;Fumihito Sasamori;Shinjiro Oshita	2010	IEICE Transactions		computer simulation;transmitter;bit error rate;metric;telecommunications;mathematics;maximum likelihood;channel state information;estimation theory;computational complexity theory;spatial multiplexing;fading;statistics;mimo	Metrics	48.67487817146299	77.88026181430226	163907

The effects of ICI canceling windows on the capacity lower bounds are examined through numerical simulations and the results indicate that considerable performance improvement can be achieved by employing the proposed windows, as compared with the conventional systems with/ without windowing when the channel varies very rapidly.	computer simulation;emoticon;ici (programming language);interference (communication);ku band;matrix representation;microsoft windows;numerical analysis;spectral efficiency	Jae Yeun Yun;Sae-Young Chung;Yong Hoon Lee	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255375	computer simulation;single antenna interference cancellation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;maximum likelihood;upper and lower bounds;fading;channel capacity;statistics;mimo	Robotics	47.422262888089996	76.01692583905091	164343

The scheme makes use of the time-correlation of the channel response to reduce the number of times of singular-value-decomposition of channel matrix for zero-forcing coordinated beamforming. We also analyze the specific rate loss resulting from null space perturbation theoretically and present the method to set up the perturbation step length of different base stations according to the interference strength of a specific user. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the algorithm complexity and obtain a significant performance enhancement compared to the algorithm with fixed perturbation step length.	algorithm;beamforming;computational complexity theory;first-order logic;interference (communication);kernel (linear algebra);mimo;perturbation theory;simulation;singular value decomposition	Guochen Liu;Gang Wu;Xiuhong Su;Shaoqian Li	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542935	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;precoding	Mobile	48.80917991821481	81.3067227007482	165319

Our developed LCIB MAP SISO detector uses novel low-complexity integration algorithms to efficiently compute the extrinsic information of the conventional optimal MAP SISO detector. As the simulation results, the iterative detection and decoding (IDD) receiver with our develop SISO detector shows almost the same BER performance and convergence behavior as compared to the IDD receiver with the conventional optimal MAP SISO detector.

The perpendicular magnetic recording provides significant aerial density gain compared to the conventional longitudinal magnetic recording. This gain comes at the cost of adding a baseline wander noise which degrades the system performance and affects the data integrity. In this article, we propose a model for the baseline wander noise. The parameters of the proposed model are computed by posing the problem as minimizing the mean square error. We demonstrate that this problem can be appropriately simplified and posed as finding a least squares problem. The proposed model on the baseline wander noise requires the knowledge of information bits to estimate the noise but this information is unavailable at the time of decoding. We propose a novel technique to cancel the baseline wander effect on the Viterbi trellis. This cancellation is done on the fly in the trellis and obviates the need of the information bits yet provides the performance gain close to the genie performance. Simulation and experimental results corroborate the analysis of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides the performance gain.	aerial photography;baseline (configuration management);data integrity;genie;least squares;magnetic storage;mean squared error;norm (social);on the fly;perpendicular recording;simulation;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm	Naveen Kumar	2015	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2461672	soft output viterbi algorithm;electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;viterbi algorithm;computer science;noise;iterative viterbi decoding	ML	52.448718544653964	79.40620016028988	166064

Linear RLS estimation error function is proposed to estimate CFO, SFO, and Channel's Impulse Response (CIR). Improved ML estimate scheme for the initial value of CFO and SFO is presented, enhancing the performance and convergence of RLS algorithm.

In this study, a maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation-based channel response differential correlation method is used to estimate a bilinear Doppler frequency offset. Specifically, reference symbols and ML estimation are used to obtain the channel response and to separate the two paths. Then, for each path, the ML frequency offset estimation is performed via a differential correlation operation. In the absence of interference, ordinary least square (LS) channel estimation and ML channel estimation demonstrate similar performance in frequency offset estimation, but the accuracy of LS channel estimation decreases dramatically in the presence of narrow-band interference, whereas ML channel estimation continues to demonstrate good accuracy, even under strong narrow-band interference, indicating high robustness. We also present a frequency offset compensation method for a two-path channel based on obtaining a maximum signal to interference ratio. The performance of the proposed methods for frequency offset estimation and compensation are validated via simulation.	bilinear filtering;channel state information;frequency offset;interference (communication);ordinary least squares;simulation	Xin Wang;Xiaolin Zhang;Yuan Yang	2016	MILCOM 2016 - 2016 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795407	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	EDA	50.64558849198659	78.49297720978582	166449

Simulation studies confirm that the analytic bounds are close to the true performance. A new decision delay adaption rule is proposed, based on the bit error rate analysis. With this new rule, the fully adaptive MLSE equalizer is shown to outperform existing fixed-delay equalizers when channel statistics are unknown.	equalization (communications);maximum likelihood sequence estimation	Iain B.

In this paper we propose a Viterbi-based algorithm to detect the data sequence of the RFID systems using the EPC-Global Generation-2 standard. By decomposing the associated data-encoded waveform on a half-cycle basis, the proposed approach first transfer the representation of the data-encoding scheme to a trellis diagram and thus leads to the application of the Viterbi algorithm for data sequence estimation. Also, different from the traditional Viterbi algorithm using correlation coefficient as the branch metrics, the proposed algorithm uses the absolute correlation coefficient as our branch metric which can exactly save the computational complexity of the Viterbi algorithm up to 50 percent. As compared to conventional approaches, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the system performance due to its full exploitation of the baseband signal structure.	electronic product code;maximum likelihood sequence estimation	Yung-Yi Wang	2010	IEICE Transactions		forward algorithm;soft output viterbi algorithm;real-time computing;telecommunications;viterbi algorithm;computer science;computer performance;iterative viterbi decoding	Visualization	50.67605660656703	77.20109829417608	167005

Then, a hybrid domain compensation scheme consisting of the time-domain and frequency-domain compensation is proposed. For the purpose of practical implementation, we also propose a comparable preamble, with which the compensation coefficients can be obtained by a low- complexity acquisition algorithm.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;coefficient;device configuration overlay;frequency divider;multiplexing;simulation;the matrix;transceiver;transmitter	Hai Lin;Xu Zhu;Katsumi Yamashita	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.615	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;frequency domain	Robotics	51.2123809346554	79.15746647751139	167177

This equalization scheme is appropriate whenever conventional equalizers are not capable of tracking phase variations in selective fading channels. The received signal is first converted to a baseband signal and then sent through a differential detector. A nonlinear processor before the equalizer generates the needed nonlinear terms that are weighted and summed in the equalizer. Nonlinear intersymbol interference at the output of the differential detector is dealt with by minimizing an error signal between the output of the equalizer and the detected data. The adaptation algorithm can be any algorithm currently used for conventional equalizers. Our simulation results confirm that for channels with spectral nulls, equalization is achieved successfully with the proposed scheme, whereas, linear equalizers, either with coherent or noncoherent detection. fail.	adaptive equalizer;algorithm;baseband;catastrophic interference;coherence (physics);equalization (communications);interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;pre-shared key;simulation	Ali Masoomzadeh-Fard;Subbarayan Pasupathy	1996	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.490236	telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science;control theory;fading	Vision	51.15048270795588	77.15493615034183	167558
04ff1d5e00b5d7a40c66c3456a40fd90e7228097	leveraging the restricted isometry property: improved low-rank subspace decomposition for hybrid millimeter-wave systems		Communication at millimeter wave frequencies will be one of the essential new technologies in 5G. Acquiring an accurate channel estimate is the key to facilitate advanced millimeter wave hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding techniques. Millimeter wave MIMO channel estimation, however, suffers from a considerably increased channel use overhead. This happens due to the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains that prevent the digital baseband from directly accessing the signal at each antenna. To address this issue, recent research has focused on adaptive closed-loop and two-way channel estimation techniques. In this paper, unlike the prior approaches, we study a non-adaptive, hence rather simple, open-loop millimeter wave MIMO channel estimation technique. We present a random phase rotation design of channel subspace sampling signals and show that they obey the restricted isometry property (RIP) with high probability. We then formulate the channel estimation as a low-rank subspace decomposition problem and, based on the RIP, show that the proposed framework reveals resilience to a low signal-to-noise ratio. It is revealed that the required number of channel uses ensuring a bounded estimation error is linearly proportional to the degrees of freedom of the channel, whereas it converges to a constant value if the number of RF chains can grow proportionally to the channel dimension while keeping the channel rank fixed. In particular, we show that the tighter the RIP characterization the lower the channel estimation error is. We also devise an iterative technique that effectively finds a suboptimal, but stationary, solution to the formulated problem. The proposed technique is shown to have improved channel estimation accuracy with a substantially low channel use overhead as compared to that of previous closed-loop and two-way adaptation techniques.	baseband;channel state information;channel use;iterative method;mimo;overhead (computing);radio frequency;restricted isometry property;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;with high probability	Wei Zhang;Taejoon Kim;David James Love;Erik Perrins	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2854779	control theory;restricted isometry property;algorithm;mimo;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;channel use;subspace topology;baseband;communication channel	Mobile	50.84809185755144	81.01930861835412	167980

Contrary to the conventional SLM which rotates the phases of QAM symbols in the frequency domain, the proposed schemes change the magnitudes as well as the phases of QAM symbols by applying binary phase sequences to the binary data sequence before mapped to QAM symbols. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have better PAPR reduction performance with shaping gain than the conventional SLM scheme for the QAM modulated OFDM signals, especially for the small number of subcarriers.	alphabet (formal languages);binary data;bitwise operation;computational complexity theory;converge;frequency divider;itil;modulation;multiplexing;noise shaping;power architecture platform reference;simulation;spatial light modulator;subcarrier;x.690	Hyun-Bae Jeon;Kyu Hong Kim;Jong-Seon No;Dong-Joon Shin	2009	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2009.2025977	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain	Arch	46.79451264038804	80.93048445739875	169137

Equalization then becomes more challenging and requires an accurate estimate of the time-variant channel. In this paper, we propose a novel Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimation of the sampled time-variant transfer function. Based on such channel estimation, we propose an iterative three step ICI mitigation technique whereby each step increases the channel estimation accuracy and, consequently, the performance of our MMSE equalization. In Step 1, we consider ICI as an additional noise term. In Step 2, we reduce the ICI at pilot positions and finally, in Step 3, we treat all estimated data symbols, obtained from Step 2, as if they were pilot symbols. We evaluate the Bit Error Ratio (BER) of our ICI mitigation technique by means of simulation and testbed measurements (up to 400 km/h). In both cases, we achieve a BER close to perfect channel knowledge and zero ICI.	bit error rate;channel state information;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;mean squared error;multiplexing;simulation;subcarrier;testbed;transfer function;x.690	Ronald Nissel;Markus Rupp	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249064	telecommunications	EDA	49.79086798565355	79.19258716914895	169516

This system has an effective function of canceling the interference noise components in the received symbol frames. For a target symbol frame to be detected, the differential frames are produced, each of which is made by subtracting one of the neighboring symbol frames from the target frame. The interference noise being left in some of the differential frames is much less than that in the target frame. By demodulating only such noise cancelled differential frames that have been estimated with cffective analyzing sequences, the information conveyed on the target frame with a heavy interference can be detected. The simulation indicates powerful canceling performance for all the possible interference disturbance is achieved.	interference (communication);simulation	Mitsuhiro Tomita;Noriyoshi Kuroyanagi;Naoki Suehiro;Shinya Matsufuji;Hironori Ishikawa	2000		10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881512	computer simulation;multipath propagation;code division multiple access;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;frequency;active noise control;high frequency;baseband;feedback;demodulation;radio receiver;data analysis;spread spectrum	Vision	48.238423308493225	76.71328618481657	169519

Since SDMA suffers from multiple access interference (MAI) and B-IFDMA from intersymbol interference (ISI), a multi-user detector that can counteract both MAI and ISI is needed for SD/B-IFDMA. We propose three low complexity linear multi-user detectors for SD/B-IFDMA, namely, Zero Forcing (ZF), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) and Non-Iterative Constrained Least Squares (NICLS). The NICLS is a heuristic multi-user detector that tries to improve the performance of ZF without the necessity of having to estimate the noise variance. Additionally, we also address the channel estimation procedure for SD/B-IFDMA by applying orthogonal time multiplexing training and using Chu sequence as the training sequence. Two estimators are considered for channel estimation for SD/B-IFDMA, namely, frequency domain Least Squares (LS) and time domain low complexity Maximum Likelihood (lcML). From bit error performance, it is shown that the MMSE multiuser detector performs best followed by NICLS and ZF. For performance assessment of the channel estimators, ZF multiuser detection is used. It is shown that the lcML outperforms LS with the penalty of having higher computational complexity.	bit error rate;channel state information;computational complexity theory;heuristic;information sciences institute;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);least squares;mean squared error;multi-user;multiplexing;sensor;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Aditya Umbu Tana Amah;Tobias Frank;Anja Klein	2010	2010 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas (WSA)	10.1109/WSA.2010.5456392	electronic engineering;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Vision	47.61764789348586	76.86477089417566	170188

We solve this problem under the assumption that the autocorrelation matrix of the pilot signal can be approximated by a diagonal matrix, the fading of different path amplitudes are independent from each other, and the additive noise is white and Gaussian. The ML frequency estimator is shown to be based on combining nonlinearly transformed path periodograms. We have derived the nonlinear function for the two cases: known and unknown fading variances. The new frequency estimators lead, in particular cases, to known ML frequency estimators for nonsparse multipath fading channels. The use of a priori information about the mean number of paths in the channel allows a significant improvement of the accuracy performance. Exploiting the sparseness of the channel impulse response is shown to significantly reduce the threshold signal-to-noise ratio at which the frequency error departs from the Cramer-Rao lower bound. However, precise knowledge of the channel sparseness is not required in order to realize this improvement.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;autocorrelation matrix;multipath propagation;neural coding;nonlinear system;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;spectral density estimation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yuriy V.

In this paper, we propose a modified V-BLAST algorithm to decrease the computational complexity by reducing the number of detection iterations required in MIMO communication systems. We begin by showing the existence of a maximum number of iterations, beyond which, no significant improvement is obtained. We establish a criterion for the number of maximum effective iterations. We propose a modified algorithm that uses the measured SNR to dynamically set the number of iterations to achieve an acceptable bit-error rate. Then, we replace the feedback algorithm with an approximate linear function to reduce the complexity. Simulations show that significant reduction in computational complexity is achieved compared to the ordinary V-BLAST, while maintaining a good BER performance.	approximation algorithm;blast;bit error rate;cs-blast;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;elegant degradation;iteration;linear function;mimo;mimo-ofdm;reduction (complexity);signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Karam Ahmed;Sherif M.

And in DPCCH there are connection dedicated pilot sequences. This paper introduces two new adaptive algorithms for smart antenna processing in such CDMA systems, which can efficiently exploit the special signal transmitting structure. The main feature is that they only force the imaginary or real part of smart antenna output close to the desired responses corresponding to pilot sequences. So we call them Partially Directing Algorithms. To improve convergence properties both of them use variable and optimal step size in weight updating. Simulations show that they have very fast convergence rate and very good steady state performance.	algorithm;channel (communications);computer simulation;imaginary time;multiplexing;rate of convergence;smart antenna;steady state;telecommunications link;transmitter	Peng Wan;Zhimin Du;Weiling Wu	2002	2002 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2002.5745664	aperture;code division multiple access;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;smart antenna;rate of convergence;steady state;multiplexing;statistics	Robotics	48.43314860468881	78.08977914991634	171659

Inspired by Slimane's work, we propose a class of complex-valued spreading sequences, which are mathematically derivable from the Kronecker product of some basic matrices. The good algebraic structure in the proposed spreading sequences, when applied in a BPSK based MC-CDMA system, can be exploited for multiple access interference (MAI) suppression, for order-2 diversity combining, and for the reduction of peak-to-average power ratio. The new spreading sequences outperform the Slimane's quadrature sequences, as evidenced by various numerical results.	audio power amplifier;bit error rate;channel (communications);hadamard transform;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);linear algebra;modulation;nonlinear system;norm (social);numerical analysis;power architecture platform reference;telecommunications link;x.690;zero suppression	Qinghua Shi;Keith Q.

Instead of eigenvalue decomposition, our method is based on a series of beamforming using simple beam patterns to reduce computational complexity.

While conventional techniques reduce noise and interference of OFDM data symbols on the CUR estimates by simple mean value calculation, the new proposal uses soft decoder outputs in order to perform iterative OFDM data symbol interference cancellation. In a typical example for 64QAM constellations, the mean-square-error (MSE) of the CIR estimates is improved by approx. 12 dB after three iterations. Based on PRP-OFDM postfixes only, it is thus possible to perform channel estimation for higher order constellations (64QAM and higher) with an initial CIR estimation over a small observation window (for 64QAM typically 30 to 40 OFDM symbols). Any loss in throughput due to additional redundancy for CIR estimation purposes, e.g. pilot tones, learning symbols, etc. is avoided at the cost of an increase in decoding complexity.	approximation;channel state information;committed information rate;decibel;interference (communication);iteration;mean squared error;modulation;parallel redundancy protocol;pseudorandomness;throughput;zero suppression	Markus Muck;Marc de Courville;Xavier Miet;Pierre Duhamel	2005	Proceedings.

The optimum TEQ is the one that results in maximum bit allocation to each block of DMT. However, the optimum design of TEQs turns out to be a very difficult task. In this paper, we give the general guidelines that one should follow in the design of TEQ to achieve a good performance. Based on the suggested guidelines, we first propose an eigenapproach design method which results in TEQs with comparable performance to those of a previously reported method, but at a much lower computational cost. Further study of the proposed guidelines reveals that the choice of target-impulse response in the design of TEQ only weakly depends on the channel response. Noting this, we propose a second design method that is even simpler than our first method, but still results in comparable designs to those of our first method and also those obtained from the much more complex methods of the present literature.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;digital monetary trust;optimal design;transceiver	Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny;Ming Ding	2001	IEEE Trans.

Two iterative estimators for rotation angle and center frequencies are derived from the analytical formulations of the OFDM-LFM signal. Both estimators are designed by measuring the residual terms between the quasi peak and the real peak in the fractional spectrum, which were obtained from the finite sampling data. Successful elimination of spectral leakage caused by multiple components of the OFDM-LFM signal is also proposed by a sequential removal of the strong coefficient in the fractional spectrum through an iterative process. The method flow is given and its superior performance is demonstrated by the simulation results.	autocorrelation;coefficient;estimation theory;excretory function;fractional fourier transform;hearing loss, high-frequency;interpolation imputation technique;iteration;iterative method;mimo-ofdm;modulation;population parameter;radar;sampling (signal processing);simulation;spectral leakage	Claire Deleglise;Yuan Zhao;Jun Zhu;Ying Xiong;Bin Tang	2018		10.3390/s18103550	electronic engineering;interpolation;mathematical optimization;autocorrelation;radar;engineering;estimation theory;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	Robotics	50.13174715193993	80.30120640279956	173192
d9bf1f3a27551184e5500213df18213db2312460	a dynamic tap allocation for concurrent cma-dd equalizers	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	This paper proposes a dynamic tap allocation for the concurrent CMA-DD equalizer as a low complexity solution for the blind channel deconvolution problem. The number of taps is a crucial factor which affects the performance and the complexity of most adaptive equalizers. Generally an equalizer requires a large number of taps in order to cope with long delays in the channel multipath profile. Simulations show that the proposed new blind equalizer is able to solve the blind channel deconvolution problem with a specified and reduced number of active taps. As a result, it minimizes the output excess mean square error due to inactive taps during and after the equalizer convergence and the hardware complexity as well.	blind equalization;cma-es;computer simulation;deconvolution;equalization (communications);mean squared error;multipath propagation;offset binary	Diego von Brixen Montzel Trindade;Vitor Halmenschlager;Leonardo Ortolan;Maria Cristina Felippetto de Castro;Fernando Comparsi de Castro;Fabrício Ourique	2010	EURASIP J.

In order to combat ISI one commonly uses equalizers that need a training sequence to adjust the equalizer tap weights. When sending a training sequence is not appropriate, blind equalization has to be used. A new blind linear equalizer is proposed. The equalizer has a recursive structure. To avoid stability problems, a soft limiter is used in the feedback loop. The weights are controlled by means of the decorrelation algorithm. For channels without precursors, the equalizer converges to the desired weights in around 500 iterations, depending on the amount of distortion. The novel blind equalization technique is globally convergent for minimum and non-minimum phase channels.	algorithm;decorrelation;equalization (communications);recursion	T. S.

Next, the data block size can be chosen to be large enough to minimize the CP overhead, yet small enough to make the channel variation over the block negligible. This paper considers the possibility of reducing the overall CP assistance, when transmitting sequences of SC blocks, while avoiding an excessively long FFT block for FDE purposes and keeping good performances through a moderate increase of the FDE receiver complexity. Firstly, we present an algorithm for a Decision-Directed Correction (DDC) of the FDE inputs when the CP is not long enough to cope with the time-dispersive channel effects. The resulting FDE performance is then evaluated in worst-case (CP-free) conditions, and the impact of previous decisions which are not error-free is shown to be rather small. In the following, we present and evaluate a novel class of reduced-CP SC/FDE schemes, which takes advantage of the DDC algorithm for replacing """"useless"""" CP redundancy by fully useful channel coding redundancy: highly power/bandwidth efficient block transmission schemes, especially recommendable for both strongly time-dispersive and time-varying channel conditions, are then achieved."""	adobe framemaker;algorithm;best, worst and average case;block size (cryptography);dispersive partial differential equation;fast fourier transform;forward error correction;multiplexing;overhead (computing);performance;run-length encoding;transmitter	António Gusmão;Paulo Torres;Rui Dinis;Nelson L.

Unlike the conventional MMSE-SIC SISO detector which performs matrix inverse operations, the LCBIS performs butterfly integration operations with low complexity. To develop the LCBIS SISO detector, we derive an integral expression for the extrinsic information of the conventional MMSE-SIC SISO detector, and then propose a butterfly integration structure to compute the integral expression efficiently. Without matrix inverse operations, LCBIS significantly reduces the complexity of the MMSE-SIC SISO detector. In addition, simulation results show that LCBIS can offer much better BER than the other SISO detectors which do not perform matrix inverse operations.	interference (communication);mimo;mean squared error;sensor;simplified instructional computer;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;x.690	Huan-Chun Wang;De-Jhen Huang;Hernan Garron Leon;Jyh-Horng Wen	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1073-4	control theory;mathematics;statistics;mimo	Robotics	47.27700336880649	78.03285378202438	175195

For Code Division Multiple Access systems, high spectral efficiencies can only be achieved by the application of multi-user detection schemes combatting the inherent multi-user interference. This paper analyzes the system performance of a quasi-synchronous OFDM-CDMA uplink for nonlinear successive interference cancellation (SIC). Realizing that channel estimation is crucial for the performance of interference cancellation schemes, their iterative structure is exploited for improving channel estimation as well as SIC significantly. First, it is shown that convolutional codes with low memory perform much better for extremely high system loads than codes with large memory. Furthermore, correlative, maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation as well as iteratively improved ML estimation are compared. Simulation results demonstrate that the loss compared to the single-user bound with perfect channel knowledge amounts only 0.7 dB even for loads of β = 2, QPSK modulation and real channel estimation.	bell laboratories layered space-time;channel state information;convolutional code;decibel;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;load (computing);modulation;multi-user;nonlinear system;precondition;simplified instructional computer;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Volker Kühn	2003		10.1109/ICC.2003.1204390	convolutional code;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	47.23436669306646	77.25534783194894	175578

Based on a recently proposed transmitted reference pulse cluster (TRPC) structure, each pulse cluster is broken into reference pulse clusters (RPCs) and data pulse clusters (DPCs). It is observed that by inserting a number of zeros at the end of each RPC and each DPC, inter pulse interference can be dramatically reduced. This also results in more multi-path delayed power being captured for data detection. The performance of the proposed iTRPC scheme is analysed and compared with that of traditional TR and the original TRPC (oTRPC) system. Simulations verify that this iTRPC scheme, with quite low-complexity and not extra energy requirements, achieves more than 7 dB performance improvement over the oTRPC scheme.	ultra-wideband	Yongnu Jin;Bin Shen;Kyung Sup Kwak	2012	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2011.0502	real-time computing;telecommunications	OS	47.698877516880955	80.62342015072497	176095

The design relies on the assumptions that the channel response can be characterized by a few nonnegligible separable multipath components and that the temporal variation of each component gain can be well characterized with a basis expansion model (BEM) using a small number of terms. As a result, the channel estimation problem is posed as that of estimating a vector of complex coefficients that exhibits a block-sparse structure, which we solve with tools from block-sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL). Using variational Bayesian inference, we embed the channel estimator in a receiver structure that performs iterative channel and noise precision estimation, intercarrier interference (ICI) cancelation, detection, and decoding. Simulation results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed receiver over state-of-the-art receivers.	algorithm;bessel filter;boundary element method;channel state information;cobham's thesis;coefficient;dictionary;emoticon;estimation theory;final fantasy xi;ici (programming language);init;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;modulation;multipath propagation;multiplexing;naive bayes classifier;sandy bridge;simulation;sparse matrix;variational principle	Oana-Elena Barbu;Carles Navarro i Manchon;Christian Rom;Tommaso Balercia;Bernard Henri Fleury	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2554611	electronic engineering;computer science;machine learning;statistics	ML	50.53969802230492	80.1405484036402	176793

The cyclic-SLM reduces a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) on an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. This scheme combines the original OFDM signal and its cyclic shifted ones. However, it needs side information (SI) of the cyclic shifts to recover the original signal that decreases the throughput of a wireless OFDM system. The DC-MF estimates the amount of a shift in a receiver side by multipling a recieved signal with its conjugates of the guard interval (GI) sequence in the time domain. Numerical results obtained through computer simulation show that the cyclic-SLM with the DC-MF significantly reduces the PAPR by around 2.5 dB as compared to the original signal. It also achieves the accuracy rate of the amount of the shift close to 100 % and the BER of 10-4 at Eb/N0 = 8.8 dB that is close to the perfect shift estimation.	computational complexity theory;computer simulation;eb/n0;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;itil;matched filter;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;spatial light modulator;throughput;transmitter;x.690	Panca Dewi Pamungkasari;Yukitoshi Sanada	2015	2015 22nd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2015.7124714	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;silicon;matched filter;correlation	Mobile	47.76335091991117	80.26403962417616	177016

On the other hand, in cognitive radio (CR) system, the secondary users that use MC-MCDA technique must deactivate the subcarriers used by the primary users. This leads to loss of orthogonality of the conventional spreading codes such as Hadamard Walsh codes. In this paper, we have modified two recently proposed linear receivers to be deployed in MIMO MC-CDMA based CR downlink transmission where some of the subcarriers are turned off. To solve the resultant non-orthogonality problem, the complex carrier interferometry (CI) codes are utilized that exist for any length. The first method, called total interference cancellation (CI-TIC), is able to completely eliminate the CSI and the MUI. The other method is called CI symbol-chip level minimum mean square error (CI-SC-MMSE) that shows superior bit error performance with respect to CI-TIC. For different scenarios, simulation results show that the proposed CI based receivers are able to effectively mitigate the MUI and the CSI in comparison with the case where Hadamard Walsh codes are utilized.	bit error rate;cognitive radio;equalization (communications);error floor;fast walsh–hadamard transform;hadamard code;hadamard transform;interference (communication);mimo;magic user interface;mean squared error;noise power;resultant;simulation;singular value decomposition;subcarrier;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Morteza Rajabzadeh;Hossein Khoshbin	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671966	chip;nickel;minimum mean square error;code division multiple access;transmitter;cognitive radio;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications link;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;interference;radio receiver;singular value decomposition;mimo	Embedded	47.48996667813951	79.91710771603307	177482

In this paper we account for all these impairments and propose a new transceiver structure at the relays and a novel receiver design at the destination in distributed space-time block code (DSTBC) based amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative networks. The Cramér-Rao lower bounds and a least squares (LS) estimator for the multi-parameter estimation problem are derived. In order to significantly reduce the receiver complexity at the destination, a differential evolution (DE) based estimation algorithm is applied and the initialization and constraints for the convergence of the proposed DE algorithm are investigated. In order to detect the signal from multiple relays in the presence of unknown channels, MTOs, and MCFOs, novel optimal and sub-optimal minimum mean-square error receiver designs at the destination node are proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed estimation and compensation methods achieve full diversity gain in the presence of channel and synchronization impairments in multi-relay AF cooperative networks.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;block code;carrier frequency;consensus dynamics;cooperative multitasking;differential evolution;estimation theory;least squares;relay;simulation;transceiver	Ali Arshad Nasir;Hani Mehrpouyan;Salman Durrani;Steven D.

This paper proposes an efficient PAPR reduction technique by taking the benefit of the classification capability of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) network. The symbols are classified in different classes and are multiplied by different phase sequences; to achieve minimum PAPR before they are transmitted. By this technique a significant reduction in number of computations is achieved.	learning vector quantization;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference	Seema Khalid;Syed Ismail Shah;Jamil Ahmad	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73554-0_11	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;mathematics	HPC	46.60886978443251	81.1939936002204	178428

The equalizer is used as a part of the receiver when the QPSK modulation is used in underwater acoustic communications. The purpose of the equalizer is to remove the inter-symbol interference which is caused by the multipath propagation of the underwater acoustic signals. Anlaboratorysimulationswas conducted basedonProakis'B channel model. To verify the validity of the equalizer, a lake experiment is then carried out in June, 2015. During the experiment, QPSK signals were transmitted at the rate of 6000sps, and the range of the communication is from 700 meters to 2200 meters. The results of the experiment shows that the equalizer can effectively remove the ISI when the multipath propagation is not severe.	acoustic cryptanalysis;channel (communications);equalization (communications);interference (communication);modulation;multipath propagation;software propagation;turbo equalizer	Lijun Xu;Shefeng Yan	2015		10.1145/2831296.2831308	turbo equalizer;electronic engineering;telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	53.66577348222242	79.56778972661478	178978

We present an EM-based iterative algorithm for combined channel estimation and decoding that makes collective use of the available data and system constraints. Minimum number of pilots are sent only in the first symbol of the packet to acquire the channel; then the iterative algorithm is used to track the channel time variation, which is assumed to follow a state-space model, using an EM-based Kalman filter. Data recovery can be achieved within a single OFDM symbol. We also propose the use of an optional outer LDPC code in serial concatenation to offer a trade-off between latency and performance, especially for multi-amplitude modulations, without affecting the complexity of the core iterative algorithm.

The conventional least-squares (LS) channel estimator performs poorly when narrowband interfering signals contaminate the multicarrier systems. A new weighted recursive least M-estimate (WRLM) channel estimator is hence developed to estimate multipath fading channels in the presence of NBI. The new robust channel estimator resorts to M-estimate and weighted least-squares (WLS) techniques. Simulations show that the WRLM channel estimator offers substantial performance gain over conventional recursive least-squares (RLS), recursive least M-estimate (RLM) and weighted RLS (WRLS) channel estimators under NBI. With the estimated channel coefficients, a robust multiuser detector is proposed to jointly suppress multiple access interference (MAI) and NBI. The performance of the linear decorrelator will degrade substantially in the presence of NBI. A weighted least M-estimate (WLM) algorithm is therefore developed to combat the NBI. The WLM multiuser detector is also based on the weighted M-estimate concept. Numerical results show that the proposed WLM multiuser detector significantly outperforms over the conventional linear decorrelator, the robust decorrelator with M-estimate and the WLS detector under NBI.	channel state information;interference (communication)	Hao Cheng;Shing-Chow Chan;Zhiguo Zhang	2008	Signal Processing Systems	10.1007/s11265-007-0145-7	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;wireless	Arch	50.34796505546255	79.41415815260032	179219

The search space for the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate is therefore (complex) (N-1)-dimensional, and maximum-likelihood MSDD (ML-MSDD) quickly becomes computationally intractable as N grows. Mackenthun's low-complexity MSDD algorithm finds the ML estimate only for Rayleigh fading channels that are time-invariant over an N symbol period. For the general time-varying fading case, however, low-complexity ML-MSDD is an unsolved problem. In this letter, we solve this problem by applying sphere decoding (SD) to ML-MSDD for time-varying Rayleigh fading channels. The resulting technique is referred to as multiple-symbol differential sphere decoding (MSDSD).	algorithm;brute-force search;channel state information;computational complexity theory;performance per watt;rayleigh fading;sensor;time-invariant system	Lutz H.-J.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a new code discriminator based on barycenter algorithm. By calculating the barycenter of code phase by multiple PN code branches’ correlation results, PN code phase error can be obtained. Theoretical analysis of new discriminator’s performance is given, and it is indicated that the code tracking loop using this algorithm can also solve the problems of low ranging precision and large mean deviation caused by multi-access interference. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation and measurements and the new discriminator is used in an aerospace engineering project successfully.	algorithm;discriminator;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);pseudorandom noise;simulation	Yongqing Wang;Cong Li;Duo Xu;Na Yang	2013	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-013-4925-3	real-time computing;constant-weight code;telecommunications;computer science	SE	52.220878832439254	76.82332447520031	180057

Two of them coincide with previously proposed algorithms and the third is shown to be best suited for implementation at a base station. The work here also improves these SA-based adaptation algorithms in the context of cellular radio networks, in terms of convergence properties by using the more recent results on the SA technique with averaging. Convergence issues of the different adaptations are investigated and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance improvement due to averaging.	algorithm;error detection and correction;mean squared error;mobile phone;multi-user;numerical analysis;stochastic approximation;waveform	Deepak Das;Mahesh K.

However, coherent FDE needs channel estimation. Pilot-assisted channel estimation is not reliable in a fast fading environment. In this paper, we apply joint frequency- domain differential detection and equalization (FDDDE) that requires no channel estimation to 2D spread/chip- interleaved DS-CDMA in a multiuser/multipath environment. The filter coefficient used in FDDDE is updated by estimating the normalized Doppler frequency. Computer simulation results show that 2D spread/chip- interleaved DS-CDMA using FDDDE is robust against fast fading.	adobe framemaker;channel state information;coefficient;coherence (physics);computer simulation;forward error correction;infinite impulse response;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mud;multi-user;multipath propagation;rayleigh fading;telecommunications link;x.690	Le Liu;Fumiyuki Adachi	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.369	computer simulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;frequency domain;computer network	Visualization	48.04230350000033	78.19472849833149	181134

The proposed investigation is based on the array manifold concept and thus, the space-time properties of the channel can be fully exploited, playing a crucial role in the operation of blind channel estimation and interference suppression techniques. The beamforming weights are designed to minimise the overall mean-squared-error (MSE) of the system. An iterative solution to the optimisation problem is firstly proposed under the system framework. A closed-form solution based on channel eigendecomposition is then proposed. The convergence of the iterative method to the closed-form solution and the equivalence of the two methods are verified through numerical simulations. The performance of the proposed approach is also supported by some illustrative examples.	beamforming;channel state information;computer simulation;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;star height;telecommunications link;transmitter;turing completeness;zero suppression	Tingting Zhang;Athanassios Manikas	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.811	telecommunications;control theory;iterative method;statistics	Robotics	48.539025360896844	77.42059205160848	181373

The traditional Bahl – Cocke – Jelineu – Raviv (BCJR) method is capable of solving the two-dimensional (2D) symbol influence problem with extremely high cost. By analysing the complexity in terms of branch, state and path in the 2D trellis-based ISI detection, the authors verify that the system complexity is mainly dominated by the window size. To reduce the detection complexity, the conventional simplifications are applied in the 2D stripwise ISI detection. In addition, a two-phase strip-wise detection is proposed to achieve a lower complexity than that of the conventional simplifications. In this system, the first detector can be realised by a low-complexity method (like the hard detection or Viterbi algorithm) to provide the mask shrinking with predicted data. After reducing the mask size, the second detector can detect the main portion of ISI by the trellis-based detection (like BCJR algorithm) with a small mask. Under the similar detection performance, the proposed scheme can achieve more than 91.76% saving in the metric computation compared with the 5 × 3window IRCSDFA (iterative row–column soft-decision feedback algorithm) simplified by the M-algorithm with M = 8.	bcjr algorithm;cyk algorithm;channel (communications);complexity;computation;information sciences institute;interference (communication);iterative method;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;text simplification;trellis quantization;two-phase locking;viterbi algorithm	Chang-Ming Lee;Tsung-Che Wu;Jian-Ren Lin	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.0184	nyquist isi criterion;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;iterative method;intersymbol interference	Mobile	47.18885799821762	76.69471576061359	181459

These receivers have a common MMSE prefilter and are followed by one of three phase-independent decision rules. The simplest decision rule selects the maximum magnitude of the MMSE filter outputs, and the other two account for the second-order statistics of the residual multiple-access interference that remains after MMSE filtering. Blind adaptive algorithms are then proposed for the three noncoherent MMSE receivers. The common adaptive algorithm for the MMSE prefilter, which is based on the stochastic approximation method, is shown to converge in the mean-squared error sense to the nonblind MMSE prefilter. Our convergence analysis yields new insight into the tradeoff between the rate of convergence and the residual mean-squared error. The noncoherent blind receivers obtained here do not require the knowledge of the received signals of any of the interfering users, and are hence well-suited for distributed implementation in cellular wireless networks or in communication systems that must operate in noncooperative environments.	adaptive algorithm;converge;interference (communication);mean squared error;modulation;multi-user;rate of convergence;stochastic approximation	Ateet Kapur;Mahesh K.

The double-block zero-padding (DBZP) algorithm can use long PIT without any assisting information to acquire weak GPS signals. Modified double-block zero-padding (MDBZP) algorithm accounts for the Doppler effect on the code duration. It also develops the Doppler frequency bin elimination method during the noncoherent integration steps. The fast modified double-block zero-padding (FMDBZP) algorithm based on MDBZP algorithm eliminates the redundant FFT computations by considering possible data bit combinations and bit edge positions. Although the computation burden of FMDBZP is lower than that of MDBZP, it may still be very heavy. This paper aims to reduce the computation complexity and save memory space further. Three methods are introduced to improve the FMD-BZP algorithm. One consists of unlikely data bit combination path elimination during coherent integration steps. The second one perform unlikely code phase elimination during noncoherent integration steps. The third one perform unlikely bit edge elimination also during noncoherent integration steps. The good performance of the proposed improved FMDBZP algorithm is illustrated using both simulation and real data.	algorithm;coherence (physics);computation;dspace;doppler effect;fast fourier transform;gps signals;global positioning system;simulation	Wen Zhang;Mounir Ghogho	2010	2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science		53.74659162266767	77.63912905561513	181733

Generalised frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) which is the focus of this work has been suggested in the literature as one of the possible solutions to meet 5G requirements. In this study, the analytical performance evaluation of minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver for GFDM is presented. The authors also proposed precoding techniques to enhance the performance of GFDM. A simplified expression of signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) for MMSE receiver of GFDM is derived using special properties related to the modulation matrix of GFDM, which are described in this study. This SINR is used to evaluate the bit error rate performance. Precoding schemes are proposed to reduce complexity of GFDM–MMSE receiver without compromising on the performance. Block inverse discrete Fourier transform (BIDFT) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based precoding schemes are found to outperform GFDM–MMSE receiver due to frequency diversity gain while having complexity similar to zeroforcing receiver of GFDM. It is shown that both BIDFTand DFT-based precoding schemes reduce peak-to-average power ratio significantly. Computational complexities of different transmitters and receivers of precoded and uncoded GFDM are also presented.	bit error rate;computation;discrete fourier transform;frequency divider;interference (communication);mean squared error;modulation;multiplexing;performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter	Shashank Tiwari;Suvra Sekhar Das;Kalyan Kumar Bandyopadhyay	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.0081	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;reduction;statistics	Networks	47.75522351253829	80.5187859852072	181751

To take advantage of soft information provided by the decoder, we combine this the Kalman filter with Turbo equalizer, so we needn't many pilot symbols in practice, still can ensure the algorithm performance and reduce the time delay and complexity of this algorithm, and apply it to the basis expansion channel model (BECM), changing the variable channel parameters in the period of one OFDM symbol into invariable ones.	algorithm;broadcast delay;channel (communications);channel state information;equalization (communications);kalman filter;mimo-ofdm;relay;simulation;turbo equalizer	Wei Wu;Xin Jia;Yueming Cai;Huachao Hu	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096912	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Robotics	49.80691770039016	75.4903869222745	181823
96eef9ffc9c513399dcc8a8f4b72ac1d56df47c4	iterative mmse detection with interference cancellation for up-link harq using frequency-domain filtered sc-fdma mimo multiplexing	interference cancellation;harq;mimo	In this paper, we propose an iterative minimum mean square error detection with interference cancellation (MMSED-IC) for frequency-domain filtered single carrier (SC)-frequency-division multipleaccess (FDMA) uplink transmission. The use of a square-root Nyquist transmit filter reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) while increases the frequency-diversity gain. However, if carrier-frequency separation among multiple-access users is kept the same as the one used for the case of roll-off factor α=0 (i.e., brick-wall filter), then the adjacent users’ spectra will overlap and multi-user interference (MUI) occurs. The proposed MMSED-IC can sufficiently suppress the MUI from adjacent users while achieving the maximum frequency-diversity gain. We apply the proposed MMSED-IC to a packet access using filtered SC-FDMA, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiplexing, and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). It is shown by computer simulation that filtered SC-FDMA with α = 1 can achieve higher throughput than orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). key words: SC-FDMA, MMSED, interference cancellation, frequencydomain filter, MIMO, HARQ	computer simulation;error detection and correction;frequency divider;hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;magic user interface;mean squared error;multi-user;multiplexing;network packet;power architecture platform reference;roll-off;sinc filter;statistical interference;telecommunications link;throughput	Suguru Okuyama;Tetsuya Yamamoto;Kazuaki Takeda;Fumiyuki Adachi	2011	IEICE Transactions		hybrid automatic repeat request;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;statistics;mimo	Mobile	47.65675803584842	80.59068496390334	182012

A method to generate a prime number N of perfect sequences with length N is presented. Moreover, these new sets have one more perfect sequence than Chu polyphase sets with the same maximum absolute value of periodic cross-correlation, and are slightly better for asynchronous direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA). The new sequences are more robust than Chu sequences when used with M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The reason for this improvement is that the new sequences are designed to be orthogonal to the M-ary QAM carriers. Other sequence transformations are also suggested and may be used to obtain many other perfect sequences with the same correlation properties. For example, the new sequences can be transformed into quadriphase sequences, also with good correlation properties.	autocorrelation;coefficient;cross-correlation;discrete fourier transform;interference (communication);modulation;multi-user;polyphase quadrature filter;rayleigh–ritz method;whole earth 'lectronic link;x.690	João da Silva Pereira;Henrique J.

This paper addresses the design of optimal training sequences for efficient estimation of MTOs and multiple channel parameters. A new hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRB) for joint estimation of MTOs and channels is derived. Subsequently, by minimizing the derived HCRB as a function of training sequences, three training sequence design guidelines are derived and according to these guidelines, two training sequences are proposed. In order to show that the proposed design guidelines also improve estimation accuracy, the conditional Cramer-Rao lower bound (ECRB), which is a tighter lower bound on the estimation accuracy compared to the HCRB, is also derived. Numerical results show that the proposed training sequence design guidelines not only lower the HCRB, but they also lower the ECRB and the mean-square error of the proposed maximum a posteriori estimator. Moreover, extensive simulations demonstrate that application of the proposed training sequences significantly lowers the bit-error rate performance of multi-relay cooperative networks when compared to training sequences that violate these design guidelines.	bit error rate;channel state information;mean squared error;multi-user;numerical method;relay;simulation	Ali Arshad Nasir;Hani Mehrpouyan;Salman Durrani;Steven D.

In previous works it has been shown for a synchronous CDMA transmission that Compressive Sensing (CS) detectors are capable of jointly detecting both activity and data in multi-user detection (MUD). However, many practical applications show some degree of asynchronicity. In order to reduce transmitter complexity, we propose an enhanced CS MUD that detects the delay in addition to activity and data. This solves synchronicity issues for scenarios with a known maximum delay, without requiring signaling or pre-compensation of asynchronicity.	algorithm;compressed sensing;mud;machine to machine;multi-user;norm (social);requirement;sensor;synchronicity;synchronous circuit;transmitter	Henning F.

Although “codes” (or training data) based algorithms can more or less solve this problem, they require unique “codes” for each user and fail when the “codes” are corrupted by unknown effects, such as Doppler shift. In this paper, based on the fact that signals always present in observations but interferences not, we propose an improved subspace intersection (SI) based on the signed URV decomposition to find the interference-free subspace. By using the proposed SI, we propose a new preprocessing method for BSS algorithms. This method takes subspace intersections on the divided received data matrices and finds the desired subspace. Simulations show that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of BSS algorithms under asynchronous interferences.	algorithm;blind signal separation;code;computer simulation;doppler effect;download;interference (communication);multi-user;preprocessor;source separation	Mu Zhou;Alle-Jan van der Veen	2011	2011 Conference Record of the Forty Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)	10.1109/ACSSC.2011.6190416	electronic engineering;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	EDA	52.11798989670998	80.48289048497912	184309

A cyclically equal-spaced, equal-energy interleaved pilot preamble is proposed by which two iterative estimators are developed. In the first estimator, we develop a modified SAGE (space alternating generalized expectation-maximization) method by incorporating multiuser interference cancellation in both time and frequency domains into the SAGE method. The proposed modified SAGE method yields a faster convergence rate, a better estimation performance, and a lower complexity than the existing conventional SAGE method from [10]. In the second method, we propose a very low complexity ad hoc method to replace the high complexity frequency offset estimator of the first method. The proposed ad hoc method is developed based on the time-domain characteristics of the pilot preamble and the frequency-domain power concentration property of OFDMA systems. It achieves almost the same estimation performance as the first proposed method but requires significantly lower complexity. Both proposed methods are not only better in estimation performance, convergence rate, and complexity, but also more robust to the number of active uplink users than the existing method while requiring only one OFDM training symbol and no restriction of the data subcarrier assignment scheme.	channel state information;complexity;cross-interleaved reed–solomon coding;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency offset;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;rate of convergence;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Xiaoyu Fu;Hlaing Minn;Cyrus D.

We consider Gaussian and Laplacian angular distributions for the incoming AoAs in the case of a Rayleigh channel model. Our estimator is based on the magnitudes and phases of the space–time correlation functions of the received signals. To this end, closed-form expressions of the required functions were derived. Two different approaches are studied using these cross-correlation functions; first at a non zero time lag and second at two different time lags. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed estimator, the two Stage approach and the improved maximum likelihood method based on the Gauss Newton algorithm are taken as benchmarks for the mean AoA and the AS estimation. For the maximum DS, the two Rays and the auto-correlation based algorithms are chosen. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator offers more accurate estimates in almost all considered scenarios. We also compare our work to a recent joint estimator which exploits the Derivatives of the cross-correlation function (DCCF). Our method outperforms the DCCF algorithm at a lower computational cost.	mimo	Nessrine Rejeb;Inès Bousnina;Mohamed Ben Salah;Abdelaziz Samet	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-018-5832-0	mimo;mathematical optimization;computer science;estimator;real-time computing;covariance matrix;gauss–newton algorithm;lag;space time;laplace operator;angle of arrival	Mobile	53.20133418696689	76.70269933824865	184818

However, an inherent drawback of OFDM, i.e., high sensitivity to frequency offset, limits the application scenarios of MIMOOFDM significantly. This paper proposes an enhanced MIMOOFDM scheme, termed double-polarized SFBC-OFDM (DPSFBC-OFDM), which can improve the robustness to frequency offset with only very low complexity increase at the receiver. Simulation results show that even for very large frequency offset, the system only has limited performance degradation (e.g., normalized frequency offset of 0.4 only lead to performance loss of smaller than 1dB for 64QAM for the proposed scheme while ordinary transmission scheme totally collapse in this case).

b9a75945f6946d0cc3223813d52d97c15fe73e03	sparse channel estimation of underwater tds-ofdm system using look-ahead backtracking orthogonal matching pursuit		Time division synchronization orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) has been attractive due to its fast synchronization and efficient spectral efficiency over conventional cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and zero padding OFDM. However, inter-block interference (IBI) affects its performance because of delay over multipath channels. To evade IBI, dual pseudo-random noise (DPN) sequences have been introduced that causes to reduce spectral and energy efficiency. But, DPN is unprepared for underwater acoustic (UWA) communication because of battery-based nature and limited bandwidth. To overcome these issues, this paper exploits compressive sensing theory algorithm for obtaining the time-varying channel state information by utilizing sparse property of UWA channels. In this paper, the IBI free region is utilized to estimate accurate UWA channel impulse response and mitigate its interference. Look-ahead backtracking orthogonal matching pursuit-based sparse channel estimation technique is proposed for underwater TDS-OFDM in a real sparse time-varying multipath channel (channel taps are randomly distributed). Furthermore, Doppler-shift of UWA channel is estimated and compensated by PN sequence in time domain. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated and demonstrated through numerical computation of bit error rate (BER) and mean square error (MSE) using Monte Carlo iterations.

The estimation algorithm uses the ranging reference portion of the preamble signal in the MB-OFDM UWB system for estimation of the time of arrival (TOA). To mitigate the effects from dense multipath interference and to reduce the computational complexity of the estimation algorithm, a modified GML algorithm is proposed. The problems of threshold settings in the modified GML algorithm, based upon the minimum root mean square error (RMSE) criteria, are discussed. Comparing with the conventional cross-correlation method and the original GML approach, the computer simulation results show that the proposed modified GML algorithm achieves better performance in estimation of the signal arrival time.	akaike information criterion;algorithm;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;cross-correlation;frequency divider;interference (communication);mean squared error;megabyte;multipath propagation;multiplexing;time of arrival;ultra-wideband	Chin-Der Wann;Shih-Wei Yang	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.720	computer simulation;telecommunications;computer science;time of arrival;mathematics;mean squared error;statistics	Metrics	49.74576165850551	77.68823564983758	186396

Due to high complexity of the optimum multiuser detector (MUD), suboptimal multiuser detectors with less complexity and reasonable performance have received considerable attention. In this contribution, a Hopfield neural network (HNN)-aided MUD is proposed for employment in DS-UWB system, which is capable of achieving a similar performance to that attained by its optimum MUD-aided counterpart at a significantly lower complexity, especially at high user loads. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed HNN-aided system can be further improved if the proposed electromagnetism-like method (EM) assisted HNN (EMHNN) MUD is employed. We demonstrate that the EMHNN aided system is capable of reducing the bit error rate (BER) by up to four orders of magnitude in comparison to the suboptimal MUDs and the MUDs based on the HNN.	artificial neural network;bit error rate;computation;expectation–maximization algorithm;hopfield network;information sciences institute;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);mud;multi-user;multipath propagation;sensor;simulation;ultra-wideband;x.690	Ho-Lung Hung;Yung-Fa Huang;Chia-Hsin Cheng	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083869	detector;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;force;intersymbol interference	Robotics	46.86773857991734	76.4186000356919	186520

Only a one-tap equalizer is needed to detect the time domain signals from the blind equalizer output with the aid of one pilot OFDM symbol. The technique is applicable irrespective of whether the cyclic prefix length is longer than, equal to, or shorter than the channel length.

In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity equaliser for inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference arising in such multicarrier transmission system. Due to a lower spreading in the FrFT-domain compared to the DFTchannel matrix as compared to the DFT domain, the equaliser can approximate the fractional-domain channel matrix by a band matrix. Further, we utilise the least squares minres (LSMR) algorithm in the calculation of the equalisation, which exhibits attractive numerical properties and low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed LSMR equaliser over benchmark schemes.	adaptive equalizer;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);coefficient;dispersive partial differential equation;equalization (communications);fast fourier transform;fractional fourier transform;interference (communication);iteration;least squares;mimo-ofdm;numerical analysis;robustness (computer science);simulation;spectral leakage;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zobel network	Ahmed A.

Unlike blind sequential detection methods designed for general channels, the proposed method exploits the channel sparsity by using estimated channel sparsity to assist in the detection of the transmitted sequence. A Gaussian mixture model is used to describe sparse channels, and two tree-search strategies are applied to estimate the channel sparsity and the transmitted sequence, respectively. To demonstrate the performance improvement achieved by the proposed blind detector, we compare it to conventional joint channel and sequence detection methods that use sparse channel estimation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed detector not only reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods but also provides superior performance, particularly when the signal to noise ratio is low.	algorithmic efficiency;channel state information;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);mixture model;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix	Weiwei Zhou;Jill K.

The proposed transform is used in a new orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( T-OFDM) system, leading to a significant improvement in bit error rate (BER) and reasonable reduction in the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Use of the proposed transform with OFDM has been found to attain high frequency diversity gain by combining all data samples resulting in the transmission over many subcarriers. Consequently, the detrimental effect arising from channel fading on the subcarrier power is minimized. Theoretical analysis of the uncoded T-OFDM performance over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), flat fading, quasi-static (fixed within the entire period of OFDM symbol transmission) frequency selective fading channel models with zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers is presented in this work. Moreover, the low superposition of the subcarriers passing through the T-transforms leads to a reduction in the high peak of the transmitted signal whilst preserving the average transmitted power and data rate. Analytical results confirmed by simulations demonstrated that the proposed T-OFDM system achieves lower PAPR and the same BER over AWGN and flat fading channels. Compared to OFDM, T-OFDM is found to have better BER when MMSE equalizer is used, but slightly worse when ZF equalizer is used.	additive white gaussian noise;bandwidth expansion;bit error rate;coexist (image);computational complexity theory;cyber resilience;data rate units;discrete fourier transform;equalization (communications);frequency divider;hadamard transform;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multipath propagation;multiplexing;power architecture platform reference;reduction (complexity);requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;uncompressed video;utility functions on indivisible goods;while;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding;zobel network	Mohammed Sh.

545c31e4a8728daca2a13f26227a5360ae406ea5	joint frequency-domain multiuser turbo equalization with successive interference cancellation for doubly-selective fading channels	multiuser detection;turbo equalization;successive interference cancellation;frequency domain	A novel multiuser separation and equalization scheme is proposed for single carrier wireless communication systems integrating frequency-domain (FD) multiuser turbo equalization (MUTE) and successive interference cancellation (SIC). The proposed iterative structure consists of multiple layers of detection, and at each layer the user with strongest power is processed by a frequency-domain multiuser equalizer to yield the soft extrinsic information on the coded bits of that user, which is delivered to a channel decoder after deinterleaving. The extrinsic information gleaned by the decoder is fed back to both the current and previous multiuser equalizers for the next iteration as a-priori information. The soft symbols of the current user are evaluated by the a-posteriori information of coded bits provided by the multiuser equalizer, and the interference reconstructed by the current user’s soft symbols is canceled out from the received signals in frequency domain. The interference-canceled signals are fed forward to subsequent layers for detection of other users. The proposed scheme effectively mitigates multiple access interference and intersymbol interference by an iterative (turbo) detection method. Numerical simulation examples demonstrate that the proposed FD MUTE with SIC outperforms the traditional MMSE multiuser equalizer over the severely doubly-selective channels, and the bit-error-rate performance tends to be better with the increase of iterations.	bell laboratories layered space-time;bit error rate;codec;equalization (communications);interference (communication);iteration;multi-user;simplified instructional computer;simulation;turbo equalizer	Jian Zhang;Yahong Rosa Zheng	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0509-6	turbo equalizer;real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	46.6141261148123	74.81963984443941	187487

Orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems have been extensively used in digital communication systems, for they are extremely efficient in terms of channel estimation and equalization. Estimation being a crucial part of digital communication systems, techniques have been developed to reduce the impact of noise on the channel estimation process, the optimal one being the LMMSE one. Until recently, non-orthogonal multicarrier modulations such as FBMC, were unable to use OFDM-like estimation techniques due to the non-orthogonality. The interference approximation method (IAM) is one of the most popular method among preamblebased estimation techniques with a limited complexity. This paper present a combination of IAM and a LMMSE-based algorithm that makes possible to achieve a LMMSE estimation in FBMC.	algorithm;approximation;channel state information;filter bank;frequency divider;identity management;interference (communication);mean squared error;modulation;multiplexing	Ludovic Caro;Vincent Savaux;Denys Boiteau;Moïse Djoko-Kouam;Yves Louët	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146025	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory	EDA	49.07476637924552	78.62292915240593	187552

05ac4b25b349e940defbdfd3787fe84c40fc91f0	an iterative mimo receiver employing virtual channels with a turbo decoder for ofdm wireless systems		This paper proposes a novel iterative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, named as an “iterative MIMO receiver employing virtual channels with a Turbo decoder.” The proposed MIMO receiver comprises a MIMO detector with virtual channel detection and a Turbo decoder, between which signals are exchanged iteratively. This paper proposes a semi hard input soft output (SHISO) iterative decoding for the iterative MIMO receiver that achieves better performance than a soft input soft output (SISO) iterative decoding. Moreover, this paper proposes a new criterion for the MIMO detector to select the most likely virtual channel. The performance of the proposed receiver is verified in a 6 × 2 MIMO-OFDM system by computer simulation. The proposed receiver achieves better performance than the SISO MAP iterative receiver by 1.5 dB at the bit error rate (BER) of 10−4, by optimizing the number of the Turbo iteration per the SHISO iteration. Moreover, the proposed detection criterion enables the proposed receiver to achieve a gain of 3.0 dB at the BER of 10−5, compared with the SISO MAP iterative receiver with the Turbo decoder. key words: multiple-input multiple-output, virtual channel, soft-input softoutput, log likelihood ratio, iterative scheme	bit error rate;computer simulation;frequency divider;iteration;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;semiconductor industry;soft-in soft-out decoder;virtual channel;x.690	Akihito Taya;Satoshi Denno;Koji Yamamoto;Masahiro Morikura;Daisuke Umehara;Hidekazu Murata;Susumu Yoshida	2015	IEICE Transactions		real-time computing;likelihood-ratio test;control theory;statistics	Networks	46.885239060601585	74.97697755158991	187768

Transmit waveform design is a topic that has received much attention recently, involving synthesis of both the signal covariance matrix, R, as well as the actual waveforms. Current methods involve a two-step process of designing R via iterative solutions and then using R to generate waveforms that fulfill practical constraints such as having a constant-envelope or drawing from a finite alphabet. In this paper, a closed-form method to design R for a uniform linear array is proposed that utilizes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients and Toeplitz matrices. The resulting covariance matrix fulfills the practical constraints such as positive semidefiniteness and the uniform elemental power constraint and provides performance similar to that of iterative methods, which require a much greater computation time. Next, a transmit architecture is presented that exploits the orthogonality of frequencies at discrete DFT values to transmit a sum of orthogonal signals from each antenna. The resulting waveforms provide a lower mean-square error than current methods at a much lower computational cost, and a simulated detection scenario demonstrates the performance advantages achieved.	algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;coefficient;computation;discrete fourier transform;elemental;expanded memory;exploit (computer security);gate array;hp 48 series;iterative method;mimo;mean squared error;phased array;r language;radar;time complexity;toeplitz hash algorithm;waveform	John Lipor;Sajid Ahmed;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2307838	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;iterative method	Graphics	53.01855735016762	81.28480981371753	187967

In this paper, we propose a jitter decomposition algorithm using least squares (LS) which simultaneously separates inter-symbol interference (ISI), random Jitter (RJ) and periodic Jitter (PJ). The algorithm includes a new time domain ISI model based on channel pulse response which is more effective than a conventional cursor convolution technique. The proposed jitter decomposition method is able to obtain the estimated individual jitter component value with great accuracy by using fewer samples of total jitter data compared with conventional methods. The simulation and hardware experiment demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

Based on the hidden pilot scheme, it is possible to estimate the channel and reduce the PAPR without bandwidth consumption. We show that the inevitable unknown data interference of the hidden pilot, which degrades the performance of channel estimation, can be successively reduced by the precoder design for each antenna with the aid of an iterative scheme. Computer simulations are presented where the proposed scheme is compared with conventional methods using channel estimation, BER, bandwidth efficiency and PAPR performance.	channel state information;frequency divider;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;polyphase quadrature filter;power architecture platform reference;simulation;spectral efficiency;x.690	Byung Wook Kim;Sung-Yoon Jung;Dong-Jo Park	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.133	computer simulation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;statistics	Mobile	47.917168631852405	79.42833609672093	188456

The conventional estimator suffers from a phase ambiguity that reduces to a sign ambiguity for the WL estimator. We derive closed-form expressions for the MSE of the two estimators under four different scenarios which vary in the amount and accuracy of the information available for ambiguity resolution. Our work demonstrates that the relative performance of WL and conventional subspace-based estimators is strongly related to the accuracy of ambiguity resolution and shows that the less information available about the actual channel for ambiguity resolution, or the lower the accuracy of this information, the more favorable the WL estimator becomes.	ampersand;channel state information;key (cryptography);mean squared error;modulation	Saeed Abdallah;Ioannis N.

Unlike the conventional DFE, this proposed equalizer considers that the channel is sparse and large number of DFE taps lead to noise accumulation problem. The new method can achieve efficient equalization by setting the active group for equalization taps and clearing the abandoned taps mechanism. As a result, it can both reduce hardware implementation complexity effectively and improve the performance compared to the conventional DFE. Brief analysis about noise accumulation effects in large-scale equalizer and working mechanism description of this effective algorithm exhibits us where the performance gain lies. Simulation results show that this modified DFE exhibits considerable computational savings, faster convergence, and better performance and improved tracking capabilities than the conventional ones. It is quite fit for applications in high-speed systems, such as high definition television (HDTV) and broadband mobile communication.	algorithm;computation;equalization (communications);simulation;sparse matrix;tree accumulation	Lingyan Fan;Chen He;Dong-Jian Wang;Ling-ge Jiang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2005.1467986	electronic engineering;real-time computing;index term;convergence;mobile telephony;telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science;reduction;wireless;broadband networks	HPC	52.500483955118575	79.86451832487177	189078

dccdc2ce9423c2348aa3ed43036469cb277bda15	hybrid-domain parallel decision feedback equalization for single-carrier block transmission		To combat intersymbol interference (ISI) in single-carrier block transmission systems, the hybrid decision feedback equalizer (HDFE) is a low-complexity, symbol-by-symbol detector that combines a frequency-domain feedforward filter and a time-domain feedback filter. To mitigate the error propagation effect of HDFE while preserving the implementation advantages of frequency-domain equalization, we propose the parallel HDFE (P-HDFE) algorithm that operates, based on the reliability of the decision variable, as an ordinary HDFE or a sequence detector that consists of multiple HDFEs running in parallel. Our study shows that, at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), P-HDFE outperforms HDFE with little increase in complexity. We analyze the symbol error rate of P-HDFE at high SNRs for the case of quaternary phase-shift keying and static ISI channels, accounting for error propagation and residual ISI. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the analysis.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;computer simulation;equalization (communications);feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;finite-state machine;information sciences institute;interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation;propagation of uncertainty;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation	Jiun-Jie Jia;Kuei-Chiang Lai;Jian-Yu Pan	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2760837	electronic engineering;equalization (audio);computer science;transmission (mechanics)	Visualization	46.50527871293501	77.47365540624997	189518

One of the major problems to withstand real application of MIMO-CEM is to estimate MIMO channel characteristics. The MIMO-CEM is based upon two contrary schemes; one is nonlinear Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE), which needs accurate channel information to replicate the received signal passing through it. The other is a low resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC), e.g., 1-bit in the default operation that removes the received signal amplitude fluctuation. This paper considers channel estimation problem in MIMO-CEM. First, we propose a MIMO-CEM adaptive channel estimator, in static and quasi-static channel conditions, based upon Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) preambles transmission, where channel parameters are iteratively estimated by observing the received MIMO preambles. Then, we extended the proposed CDM preamble method to Decision Directed Channel Estimation (DDCE) to track MIMO-CEM channel in high Doppler frequency conditions and clarify the effectiveness of MIMO-CEM in dynamic channel conditions.	analog-to-digital converter;backhaul (telecommunications);block size (cryptography);channel state information;dead code elimination;image resolution;mimo;mimo-ofdm;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;quantum fluctuation;self-replicating machine;single-sideband modulation;trionic	Ehab Mahmoud Mohamed;Osamu Muta;Hiroshi Furukawa	2011	2011 IEEE GLOBECOM Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162510	code division multiple access;binary erasure channel;image resolution;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;maximum likelihood;precoding;channel capacity;multiplexing;mimo	Mobile	50.277225507908746	78.99727817681548	189833

The estimated channel information is used to enable the coherent data detection to combat the detrimental effect of multipath propagation of the transmitted signal as well as multiple access interference (MAI). Different channel estimation schemes are evaluated and compared in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimate and the bit error rate (BER) performance. Based on our analysis and numerical results, some recommendations are made on how to choose appropriate channel estimators in practical systems.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;code;coherence (physics);intelligence amplification;interference (communication);kalman filter;mean squared error;modulation;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;rayleigh fading;smoothing;software propagation;stacking;x.690	Pei Xiao;Erik G.

Under multipath fading channels, synchronization methods proposed for the single input single output (SISO) OFDM systems may be to fail if they are directly applied to the multiple-antenna OFDM-based DVB-H receivers. In this paper, a plateau removed maximum likelihood synchronization scheme is proposed for the multiple-antenna OFDM-based DVB-H receivers. Compared to the conventional maximum likelihood multiple antenna OFDM synchronization scheme, the proposed scheme not only removes the timing ambiguity caused by the plateau problem and has better detection capability but also is robust to different multipath fading channels. System performance studies are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme for the multiple-antenna OFDM-based DVB-H receiver under different fading channel situations.	dvb-h;digital video broadcasting;frequency divider;handheld game console;mimo;multipath propagation;multiplexing;plateau's problem;soft-in soft-out decoder	Zi-Wei Zheng;Dan Huang	2007	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2007.4429213	synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;index term;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;maximum likelihood;digital video broadcasting;fading	Mobile	47.523997823640734	78.97764105242642	190331

This paper proposes an efficient blind calibration method for nonlinearity mismatches in M-channel TIADCs. A modified model for nonlinearity mismatches is established by exploiting binary Hadamard transform (BHT) and differentiator. The calibration is composed of two stages— mismatches compensation and coefficients identification. The principle of mismatches compensation is to reconstruct estimations of the mismatchesinduced spurious components and subtract them from the original TIADC’s output. The coefficients identification is performed based on filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm. By using improved model and calibration algorithm, the proposed method consumes less computational resource according to the complexity comparison. To tackle the 4-order nonlinearity mismatches in an 16-channel TIADC, the proposed method consumes 23% fewer multipliers than the previous work. Simulation results reveal that both effective resolution and dynamic range improve a lot after calibration.	algorithm;coefficient;complexity;computation;computational resource;computer simulation;differentiator;dynamic range;emoticon;erlang (unit);hadamard transform;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;nonlinear system;stemming;xfig	Xiangyu Liu;Hui Xu;Husheng Liu;Yinan Wang	2017	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.14.20170468	differentiator;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	51.63233559863981	79.03717542758098	190611

3dfa48db284cc5694b3a786223db265792cb4845	new pilot allocation design schemes for sparse channel estimation in ofdm system		In this paper, the problem of the deterministic pilot allocation for sparse channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system is investigated. This method is based on mutual coherence minimization of the measurement matrix associated with the OFDM system pilot subcarriers. It is known that if the set of pilot pattern is a Cyclic Difference Set (CDS), the mutual coherence of the measurement matrix is minimized. However, CDS in most practical OFDM system is not available. Few research efforts have tackled the problem of pilot allocation by proposing methods that lead to suboptimal solutions in order to ignore the computationally complex exhaustive search method. This contribution, however, proposes two pilot allocation design schemes for the construction of deterministic partial Fourier matrices satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) namely, the Generic Random Search (GRS) and Progressive Search (PS) based on bounding the mutual coherence between different columns of the measurement matrix. Simulation results show that the two proposed pilot allocation design schemes are effective and offer a better channel estimation performance in terms of MSE when compared to former pilot allocation design methods.	algorithm;brute-force search;channel state information;column (database);combinatorial optimization;committed information rate;dft matrix;data structure;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;mutual coherence (linear algebra);openmp;optimization problem;pilot ace;romp;random search;restricted isometry property;signal reconstruction;simulation;sparse matrix;subcarrier	Anthony Ngozichukwuka Uwaechia;Nor Muzlifah Mahyuddin	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)	10.1109/ICSIPA.2017.8120581	mathematical optimization;restricted isometry property;pattern recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;random search;mutual coherence;algorithm design;sparse matrix;brute-force search;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;matrix (mathematics)	Robotics	51.07256699384376	81.52897893962226	191845

The presented method first estimates the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the DS-signal, then performs beamforming, and finally makes synchronization decision based on the maximum output of the MF. Because the amount of data needed in DOA estimation depends on the prevailing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the proposed method operates iteratively. The method starts by collecting a piece of data for DOA estimation. Due to the inaccurate DOA estimation, the main beam of the radiation pattern may be steered to erroneous direction and code acquisition may be failed. After a fail more data is collected and the accuracy of DOA estimate improves. This process is repeated until DOA and delay estimation succeeds. The results show that it is advantageous to start by collecting only a small amount of data for DOA estimation because the shortest mean acquisition times are achieved in that case	beamforming;direction of arrival;estimation theory;iterative method;kernel density estimation;matched filter;radiation pattern;signal-to-noise ratio;smart antenna	Henri Puska;Harri Saarnisaari;Jari H.

This structure is exploited to derive a closed-form expression of the CFO. The proposed solution offers a wide acquisition range with reduced computational load.

We consider the case where the channel is quasi-static (i.e., the sampling period is several orders of magnitude smaller than the coherence time of the channel). Several training sequences can thus be used in order to produce the channel estimate. The proposed method can be classified as semiblind and exploits all channel-output samples containing contributions from the training sequences (including those containing contributions from the unknown surrounding data symbols). Experimental results show that the proposed method closely approaches the Cramer-Rao bound and outperforms existing training-based methods (which solely exploit the channel-output samples containing contributions from the training sequences only). Existing semiblind ML methods are tested as well and appear to be outperformed by the proposed method in the considered context. A major advantage of the proposed approach is its computational complexity, which is significantly lower than that of existing semiblind methods.	channel state information;computational complexity theory;exploit (computer security);sampling (signal processing)	Olivier Rousseaux;Geert Leus;Petre Stoica;Marc Moonen	2005	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2005.858353	speech recognition;signal processing;pattern recognition;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Vision	50.9872198220407	75.9754251958747	193258

The conventional least square constant modulus algorithm (LSCMA) is easy to capture the interference signals in the system that has several constant modulus signals. In order to overcome this shortage, a linearly constrained LSCMA algorithm is proposed by applying the linear constrained condition to the LSCMA, thus makes the algorithm converge to the desired user. To further enhance the performance, we apply the subspace decomposition to autocorrelation matrix of the received signal, and combine the Lagrange method and the partial Taylor-series expansion to update the weight vector. To reduce the computational complexity, an orthogonal projection approximation subspacetracking (OPAST) algorithm is employed for adaptive signal subspace estimation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has lower complexity, superior performance and is more robust in the case of random initial value.

We study a channel estimation technique where partially decoded data is used to estimate the channel. We show that there are two types of interference components in this scheme that do not vanish even when the number of antennas grows to infinity. The first type, referred to as cross-contamination, is due to the correlation among the data signals from different users. The second type, referred to as self-contamination, is due to the dependency between the channel estimate and the estimation error. Cross contamination is in principle similar to pilot contamination in a conventional pilot-based channel estimation scheme, while self-contamination is unique for the data-aided scheme. For spectral efficient, the data part in a signaling frame is typically much longer than the pilot part for a practical system. Consequently, compared with pilot signals, data signals naturally have lower cross correlation. This fact reduces the cross-contamination effect in the data-aided scheme. Furthermore, self-contamination can be effectively suppressed by iterative processing. These results are confirmed by both analyses and simulations.	channel state information;cross-correlation;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;scheme;simulation;telecommunications link	Ping Li	2014	2014 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications	10.1109/HMWC.2014.7000245	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;control theory	Mobile	49.66383338608781	80.89888937928511	193686

While the conventional null subcarrier based methods estimate the offset by a single global search, the proposed method employs a two step procedure. Firstly the integer frequency offset is estimated by means of a cost function minimization over the integer offset values. Then the fractional frequency offset is estimated through a fine search over one subcarrier spacing on either side centered on zero after correcting the integer offset. Performance of the frequency offset estimator is mathematically analyzed by deriving the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Our algorithm is shown to outperform some of the methods reported in literature in terms of BER performance and receiver complexity.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;computational complexity theory;finite element method;loss function;overhead (computing);reduction (complexity);simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;x.690	S.

This new form of OFDM uses asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) on the odd frequency subcarriers and DC biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) on the even subcarriers. By using a form of interference cancellation both the ACO-OFDM and the DCO-OFDM signals can be recovered at the receiver. It is shown that the DCO-OFDM component causes no interference on the odd frequency subcarriers so the receiver processing for the ACO-OFDM signal is identical to a conventional ACO-OFDM system. The ACO-OFDM signal causes clipping noise which falls on the even subcarriers. However, this interference can be estimated and cancelled at the receiver. The cancellation process results in a 3 dB noise penalty in the DCO-OFDM component. Simulation results are presented for an additive white Gaussian noise channel and it is shown that the new technique can achieve better optical power performance than the conventional schemes.	additive white gaussian noise;device configuration overlay;frequency divider;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;power gain;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter;uncompressed video;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sarangi D.

The technique uses a preamble and is thus particularly suitable for burst-mode communications. The preamble consists of orthogonal training sequences that are simultaneously transmitted from the various transmit antennas. The proposed system exploits all subcarriers in the frequency domain, which provides a remarkable performance improvement, and reaches the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) at a high signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed method is compared with three known CFO estimators in the literature: Cyclic-Prefix-based (CP), Moose, and Classen techniques that show clear advantages.	adaptive scalable texture compression;carrier frequency offset;code;mimo;mimo-ofdm;moose;multiplexing;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier	Ahmed Bannour;Yichuang Sun;Mohamed Lassaad Ammari;Fabien Delestre;Ridha Bouallegue	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2199143	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics	Visualization	48.34932385034366	78.59225697576059	194808

The SISO decoder and the channel estimator work in an iterative way and no training sequence is used in the estimation. Compared with the non data-aided channel estimation without using the soft information output from the SISO decoder, the performance of this iterative channel estimation is better. We also explain this iterative method by using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which can be used to prove the convergence of this iterative method.	channel state information;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;multipath propagation;soft-in soft-out decoder;ultra-wideband	Yabo Li;Xiang-Gen Xia;Richard Yao;Wenwu Zhu	2005	Proceedings.

Employing the complex-exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) for representing doubly selective channels, a maximum likelihood (ML) objective function of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and MIMO time-varying channel responses (BEM coefficients) is formulated to develop a semiblind ML framework for joint time-variant channel estimation and synchronization. To reduce the overhead of pilot signals without sacrificing estimation accuracy, the soft bit information from a soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder is exploited in computing soft estimates of data symbols to be functioned as pilots for further enhancing the estimation accuracy after CFO and channel acquisition phase (initial coarse estimation) using pilots. In other words, the resulting semi-blind ML estimation scheme operates in conjunction with soft decoding process in a (iteratively) progressive manner to exploit remarkable gains of turbo processing (iterative extrinsic information exchange). Simulation results show that the proposed turbo joint channel estimation and synchronization scheme offers high estimation accuracy that approaches Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) over a wide range of CFO values under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.	boundary element method;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;coefficient;frequency divider;information exchange;iteration;iterative method;loss function;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;optimization problem;overhead (computing);semiconductor industry;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;time complexity	Hung Nguyen-Le;Tho Le-Ngoc;Nghi H.

Acquisition in the presence of severe multiple-access interference with time varying codes makes the task even more difficult. Inefficient designs cause a large number of false alarms and/or missed detections. This paper applies a powerful acquisition technique to IDMA systems in the uplink. Under high multiple access interference conditions conventional acquisition techniques used for DS-CDMA systems simply fail. The proposed method utilises soft data from the iterative IDMA receiver to effectively cancel interference from the co-channel users. Analytical performance in terms of the number of users, spreading gain, performance of the IDMA receiver, and noise variance is developed, together with simulation results.	axosoft;channel capacity;code;cross-correlation;detection theory;interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;pmd;process gain;sensor;simulation;telecommunications link	Bathiya Senanayake;Mark C.

This technique, based on a linear parametric channel model, rotationally employs estimating signal parameter via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and interchannel interference (ICI) mitigation to get more accurate channel estimation and data detection. Simulation results show that the proposed method is robust to changes in channel characteristics, and the performance of which is superior to other structures without ICI mitigation or with integral-delays.	channel (communications);channel state information;detection theory;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);linear model;multiplexing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Weihua Chen;Xia Lei;Shaoqian Li	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02962-2_51	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;channel state information;fading;precoding;statistics;detection theory;mimo	Mobile	49.55824663107202	78.18482987840969	197086

The mmWave transceivers are usually highly integrated but have severe RF impairments. Thus, to design pre-distortion schemes, it is difficult to pre-distort each RF component separately. In this paper, we consider joint IQ (In-phase and Quadrature) imbalance and PA (Power Amplifier) nonlinearity pre-distortion designs for mmWave transmitters. In the designs, we treat the transmitter as a whole and only process the baseband input and PA output. We propose two methods, one is the two-step design, where the IQ imbalance and PA nonlinearity are pre-distorted in two-steps with a unified training structure. The other is the one-step design, where we first derive the model that can jointly characterize IQ imbalance and PA nonlinearity, then one block is used to pre-distort the both. We also show that decreasing the number of coefficients properly can decrease the computational complexity without significant loss in performance.	audio power amplifier;baseband;coefficient;computational complexity theory;data rate units;distortion;input/output;nonlinear system;pa-risc;radio frequency;transceiver;transmitter	Linlin Z Fan;Yabo Li;Minjian Zhao	2014	2014 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2014.7063464	telecommunications;amplifier	EDA	49.606121243754835	81.16968373431976	197609
b55dc514e577bb83eec52e1f35efd68d2e1d1e55	blind beamforming using the mcma and sag-mcma algorithm with music algorithm		Satellite communication system does not use training sequence because the satellite communication channel is similar to the additive white gaussian noise (AWGN). But, in the mobile satellite communication environment, inter-symbol-interference (ISI) seriously occurs due to movement of receiver. We must use the blind equalization for remove the ISI in mobile satellite communication. Blind equalization techniques such as MCMA and SAG-MCMA is suitable for channel equalization in the mobile satellite environment. But equalization performance of blind equalizer were not as satisfactory as expected. In this paper, we propose a blind equalization technique based on coordinate change and beamforming method in order to improve the BER performance of receiver in mobile satellite communication. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme with coordinate change need to less SNR about 1 dB to satisfy BER performance (10-5).	algorithm;beamforming;sql access group	Youngguk Kim;Heung-Gyoon Ryu	2013		10.1007/978-94-007-6738-6_102	computer network;communications satellite;computer science;blind equalization;multiple signal classification;additive white gaussian noise;equalization (audio);electronic engineering;equalization;beamforming;communication channel	Robotics	47.401367928792304	79.73147764798038	197799

In this paper, we investigate the performance of the upper-layer signal cancellation with DFT-based channel estimation techniques, due to their capability of providing near-optimal performance for challenging channels with long delay spread at low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Both Pilot-Aided (PA) and Decision-Directed (DD) techniques are investigated and their performances are compared. The major issue with DFT-based techniques is the “edge effect” for OFDM systems with Null spectrum on either side of the useful spectrum, which serves as guard band. A Cloud-Txn/LDM system usually requires very accurate channel estimation to achieve very low residual upper-layer signal after the cancellation. In this case, the “edge effect” becomes a significant impairment. In this paper, we evaluate different data-padding methods to reduce the “edge effect”, which fill the Null spectrum with Virtual Pilots (VP). It is shown that, with proper data-padding technique, 30 to 40 dB signal cancellation can be achieved.	algorithm;channel state information;data structure alignment;decibel;detection theory;division by zero;ll grammar;ll parser;layer (electronics);multiplexing;noise (electronics);pa-risc;phy (chip);performance;signal-to-noise ratio	Liang Zhang;Yiyan Wu;Wei Li;Heung Mook Kim;Sung Ik Park;Pablo Angueira;Jon Montalban;Manuel Vélez	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2014.6873491	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Arch	47.75788686607652	80.02658261084557	198089

For the first time, a novel estimation framework is proposed for fast time-varying channels. The noise variances and channel are jointly estimated via the maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. By considering in the EM formulation the channel as the unwanted parameter and the noise variances as the parameters to be estimated, a closed-form analytical expression for the estimation of the noise variances is obtained; the channel being given by the Kalman smoother.

In the simulation results we show that, despite its increased computational complexity, the performance and higher bandwidth efficiency of OQAM FBMC systems makes them a competitive alternative to conventional multicarrier systems like cyclic prefix based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM).	adaptive equalizer;algorithm;computational complexity theory;digital subchannel;equalization (communications);filter bank;frequency divider;ici (programming language);information sciences institute;least mean squares filter;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency	Dirk S.

With spatial-temporal basis expansion model (ST-BEM), the channel information is decomposed into the spatial information and gain information, where the former is determined by the central angle as well as the angular spread of the incoming signal. We first blindly track the central angle by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and obtain the angular spread through Taylor series expansion of the steering vector. Then, the channel gain information can be estimated with only a few pilot symbols.

Spatial division multiplexing using a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique has been studied to increase the transmission rate to over 100 Mbps. Before we can detect the transmitted data, we need AGC adjustment, timing synchronization, frequency offset estimation, and channel estimation using a preamble. The current WLAN system with a single transmit antenna, based on the IEEE 802.11a standard, uses a four OFDM symbol duration preamble. However, the preamble period proposed so far for the MIMO-OFDM system grows linearly with the transmit antenna number. This results in an increased overhead, and the conventional technique is not efficient. In this paper, we present a channel and frequency offset estimation scheme using a preamble with four OFDM symbol duration for the MIMO-OFDM system in WLANs. This preamble has the same duration as that of the IEEE 802.11a standard, and does not increase the overhead.

The technique, called residual ISI cancellation (RISIC), uses a combination of tail cancellation and cyclic restoration and is shown to offer large performance improvements. The effects of imperfect channel estimation are also considered. The RISIC algorithm is applied to a typical terrestrial high-definition television (HDTV) broadcasting system that uses a concatenated coding scheme for error control. Results show that the RISIC algorithm can effectively mitigate residual ISI on static or slowly fading ISI channels.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel state information;circuit restoration;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;error detection and correction;frequency divider;hdmi;information sciences institute;interference (communication);iteration;multiplexing;terrestrial television	Dukhyun Kim;Gordon L.
