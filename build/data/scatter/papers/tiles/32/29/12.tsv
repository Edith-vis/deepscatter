The chip is designed in a 0.5 μm CMOS process which has 3 metal layers and 2 poly layers and is a 5 volt process. The chip contains ion sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs), as well as ISFETs with read-out circuitry, for monitoring the pH of solutions placed on top of the chip. Interdigitated electrode structures (IDESs) are made using the top metal of the process to be used for sensing cellular attachment and proliferation via impendence. IDES read-out circuits and IDES test structures are included. The chip also contains test amplifiers, bandgap reference test structures, and connections for post-processing. We designed the chip to accommodate packaging into an environment where it will be directly exposed to a cell culture environment. Specifically we designed the chip to have the incorporated sensors near the center of the chip allowing for connections made around the edge of the chip to be sealed off using an epoxy or similar material to prevent shorting. Preliminary electrical characterization results for our amplifier indicate a gain of 48 dB, a bandwidth of 1.65 kHz, and a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 72 dB. We also present a packaging technique using a flexible pcb substrate.	amplifier;attachments;cmos;cell culture techniques;deny (action);electronic circuit;epoxy resins;field effect (semiconductor);integrated development environment;ion-selective electrodes;ions;microfluidics;poly a;polychlorinated biphenyls;printed circuit board;rejection sampling;solutions;substrate (electronics);transistor;video post-processing;anatomical layer;sensor (device)	David Welch;Jennifer Blain Christen	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347113	operational amplifier;packaging and labeling;electronic engineering;microfluidics;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;ph;cmos;bio-mems;biosensor	EDA	94.56940054818787	-18.605534571647805	191316

This micro pump consists of two active one-way valves that make use of the same ICPF actuator. The overall size of this micro pump prototype is 12 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length. The actuating mechanisms are as follows: (1) the ICPF actuator as the diaphragm is bent into anode side by application of electricity. Then the volume of the pump chamber increases, resulting in the inflow of liquid from the inlet to the chamber; (2) by changing the current direction, the volume of the pump chamber decreases, resulting the liquid flow from the chamber to the outlet; and (3) the ICPF actuator is put on a sine voltage, the micro pump provides liquid flow from the inlet to the outlet continuously. Characteristic of the micropump is measured. The experimental results indicate that the micro pump has the satisfactory responses.	british informatics olympiad;polymer	Shuxiang Guo;Kinji Asaka	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241861	control engineering;electronic engineering;ionic conductivity;engineering;electrical engineering	Crypto	90.79904428573846	-17.633460700702507	192075

The power spectrum density (PSD) of thermal fluctuations together with Sader's model of the cantilever allow for the indirect measurement of the liquid viscosity with good accuracy. The good quality of the deflection signal and the characteristic low noise of the instrument allow for the detection and corrections of drawbacks due to both the cantilever shape irregularities and the uncertainties on the position of the laser spot at the fluctuating end of the cantilever. Variation of viscosity below 0:03mPa·s was detected with the alternative to achieve measurements with a volume as low as 50 µL.	johnson–nyquist noise;spectral density;viscosity	Felipe Aguilar Sandoval;Manuel Sepúlveda;Ludovic Bellon;Francisco J Melo	2015		10.3390/s151127905	text mining;telecommunications;thermal fluctuations;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;data science;nanotechnology;physics	Mobile	92.60719561897147	-19.999684503230725	192346

0cbaf5a0e7548c72551850fe6f70b2dacc15c85a	the vibro-acoustic modelling and analysis of damage mechanisms in paper	qc physics;qa75 electronic computers computer science	This thesis investigates the use of the acoustic emission (AE) monitoring technique for use in identifying the damage mechanisms present in paper associated with its production process. The microscopic structure of paper consists of a random mesh of paper fibres connected by hydrogen bonds. This implies the existence of the two damage mechanisms of interest, the failure of a fibre/fibre bond and the failure of a fibre. The majority of this work focuses on the development of a novel hybrid mathematical model which couples the mechanics of the mass/spring model to the acoustic wave propagation model for use in generating the acoustic signal emitted by complex structures of paper fibres under strain. A discussion of the coupling method is presented and the model is then analysed using a simple plucked fibre as a test case with a comparison between the numerical and experimental results. The hybrid mathematical model is then used to simulate small fibre networks aimed at providing information on the acoustic response of each damage mechanism. To do this the mass/spring model must successfully simulate the response of the fibre structure when undergoing a fibre/fibre bond failure or a fibre failure. This can be achieved by dynamically manipulating the mass and spring elements of the fibre structure. The simulated AEs from the two damage mechanisms are then analysed using a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to provide a two dimensional time/frequency representation of the signal. From the CWT certain features of the AEs can be attributed to each damage mechanism and as such a criteria for the time and frequency properties of each damage mechanism can		David L.

Research groups working with living cells are confronted with the problem, that common endpoint measurement methods are not able to map dynamic changes. With consideration of time as a further dimension, the dynamic and networked molecular processes of cells in culture can be monitored. These processes can be investigated by measuring several extracellular parameters. This paper describes a high-content system that provides real-time monitoring data of cell parameters (metabolic and morphological alterations), e.g., upon treatment with drug compounds. Accessible are acidification rates, the oxygen consumption and changes in adhesion forces within 24 cell cultures in parallel. Addressing the rising interest in biomedical and pharmacological high-content screening assays, a concept has been developed, which integrates multi-parametric sensor readout, automated imaging and probe handling into a single embedded platform. A life-maintenance system keeps important environmental parameters (gas, humidity, sterility, temperature) constant.	cell culture techniques;cellular morphology;characteristic impedance;chemicals;chemosensitivity assay;communication endpoint;electricity;embedded system;embedding;exposure to humidity;galaxy morphological classification;handling (psychology);infertility;ion channel;iontophoresis;membrane potentials;metabolic process, cellular;microelectrodes;microplate;microscope device component;neoplasms;numerous;patients;pharmacology;population parameter;potentiometer;protons;real-time clock;tissue membrane;cell growth;negative regulation of reactive oxygen species biosynthetic process;sensor (device)	V.

However, instruments for such applications may not be maintained or calibrated regularly. Since machine reliability is a key issue for normal operation, this study presents a system model of the real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine to analyze the instrument design through numerical experiments. Based on model analysis, a systematic approach was developed to lower the variation of DNA quantification and achieve a robust design for a real-time PCR-on-a-chip system. Accelerated lift testing was adopted to evaluate the reliability of the chip prototype. According to the life test plan, this proposed real-time PCR-on-a-chip system was simulated to work continuously for over three years with similar reproducibility in DNA quantification. This not only shows the robustness of the lab-on-a-chip system, but also verifies the effectiveness of our systematic method for achieving a robust design.	accelerated life testing;dna barcoding;diagram;entity name part qualifier - adopted;experiment;exposure to humidity;heater device component;instrument - device;mathematical model;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;microfabrication;microtechnology;numerical analysis;polymerase chain reaction;prototype;quantitation;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;simulation;system identification;test plan;united states national institutes of health	Da-Sheng Lee	2010		10.3390/s100100697	real-time computing;real-time polymerase chain reaction;simulation;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;computer aided design	Embedded	95.31226364053023	-19.52772212026118	195104

Furthermore, to increase the efficiency of in situ casting or precast of concrete, determining the optimal time of demolding is important for concrete suppliers. Surface bonded lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers have been used for damage detection and parameter identification for various engineering structures over the last two decades. In this work, a reusable PZT transducer setup for monitoring initial hydration of concrete and structural health is developed, where a piece of PZT is bonded to an enclosure with two bolts tightened inside the holes drilled in the enclosure. An impedance analyzer is used to acquire the admittance signatures of the PZT. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) is employed to associate the change in concrete strength with changes in the PZT admittance signatures. The results show that the reusable setup is able to effectively monitor the initial hydration of concrete and the structural health. It can also be detached from the concrete for future re-use.	act relationship join - detached;analyzer, device;antenna analyzer;antivirus software;characteristic impedance;enclosure device component;mit-shm;mean squared error;plant roots;population parameter;preparation;pyschological bonding;quantitative impedance;repeatability;super high material cd;transducer device component;type signature;concrete;lead titanate zirconate;spiromustine	Yaowen Yang;Bahador Sabet Divsholi;Chee Kiong Soh	2010		10.3390/s100505193	structural engineering;concrete;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;forensic engineering;mechanical engineering	SE	90.49185964165912	-18.47240589209632	195134
0a59cd2439ba3bd6b6fffc4a54c92bb08d169ebe	simultaneous characterization of instantaneous young's modulus and specific membrane capacitance of single cells using a microfluidic system	instantaneous young s modulus;single cell analysis;specific membrane capacitance;期刊论文;microfluidics;cellular biophysics	This paper presents a microfluidics-based approach capable of continuously characterizing instantaneous Young's modulus (E(instantaneous)) and specific membrane capacitance (C(specific membrane)) of suspended single cells. In this method, cells were aspirated through a constriction channel while the cellular entry process into the constriction channel was recorded using a high speed camera and the impedance profiles at two frequencies (1 kHz and 100 kHz) were simultaneously measured by a lock-in amplifier. Numerical simulations were conducted to model cellular entry process into the constriction channel, focusing on two key parameters: instantaneous aspiration length (L(instantaneous)) and transitional aspiration length (L(transitional)), which was further translated to E(instantaneous). An equivalent distribution circuit model for a cell travelling in the constriction channel was used to determine C(specific membrane). A non-small-cell lung cancer cell line 95C (n = 354) was used to evaluate this technique, producing E(instantaneous) of 2.96 ± 0.40 kPa and Cspecific membrane of 1.59 ± 0.28 μF/cm2. As a platform for continuous and simultaneous characterization of cellular E(instantaneous) and C(specific membrane), this approach can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of cellular biophysical properties.	carcinoma of lung;characteristic impedance;electric capacitance;kilohertz;kilopascal;known-plaintext attack;lock-in amplifier;microfluidics;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;numerical linear algebra;quantitative impedance;simulation;takayasu arteritis;tissue membrane;traffic enforcement camera;cancer cell	Yang Zhao;Deyong Chen;Yana Luo;Feng Chen;Xiaoting Zhao;Mei Jiang;Wentao Yue;Rong Long;Junbo Wang;Jianchu Chen	2015		10.3390/s150202763	electronic engineering;microfluidics;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;physics	Mobile	94.04349939919398	-18.830020584522984	195563

The MRSA can be firstly bound onto the surface of the magnetic beads, followed by purifying the magnetic complexes with the incorporation of permanent magnet and the microfluidic control module. Finally, the specific genes of MRSA can be amplified by utilizing an on-chip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) module. Hence, the integrated microfluidic system can automatically perform isolation and detection of MRSA within a short period of time and can be used as a promising platform for biological and medical applications in the future.	british informatics olympiad;control unit;maxima and minima;purification of quantum state;selectivity (electronic);sensitivity and specificity;vortex	Yu-Hsin Liu;Kang-Yi Lien;Chih-Hung Wang;Jiunn-Jong Wu;Gwo-Bin Lee	2011	2011 6th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2011.6017302	magnet;molecular biology;infectious disease;polymerase chain reaction;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;physics;quantum mechanics;molecular biophysics	Robotics	95.29556706092761	-18.513399308006292	196397

The active part of the VCF is a resonating circuit, which is tuned to the Lamor frequency of the MR scanner. The experiments were performed on a low field MRI system. The susceptibility artifact behaviour of different commercially available VCFs and their materials was investigated. Three MR-active VCF prototypes were built based on these results and evaluated. No lead connection between the resonating circuit of the implant and the MR system is necessary for reception of the MR signal. Localisation of the prototypes within the MR image was possible by their signal enhancement. The results provide a basis for further developments and investigations of MR-active VCF implants for high field MR scanners.		G. Schaefers;W. Zylka;M. Busch;A.

The antenna parameters are optimized to obtain a good impedance match over the required frequency range. The designed antenna size is 18mm × 18mm. Further, a flexible conformal 4×4 ultra-wideband antenna array, in a format similar to that of a bra, was developed for a radar-based breast cancer detection system.	ansi escape code;antenna device component;array data structure;body tissue;breast cancer detection research;computer simulation;frequency band;hfss;impedance matching;kapton;mammary neoplasms;maximum power transfer theorem;microwave;polarization (waves);property and casualty state mandated forms attachment:find:pt:^patient:doc;quantitative impedance;radar;simulators;sixteen;ultra-wideband;wearable computer;anatomical layer;co(polyether-imide);disease transmission	Hadi Bahrami;Emily Porter;Adam Santorelli;Bernard Gosselin;Milica Popovic;Leslie Ann Rusch	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944445	electronic engineering;nuclear magnetic resonance	Embedded	94.05379536042616	-23.46581357847656	196594

A novel microwave noninvasive testing technique is presented for breast cancer detection. The physical basis for breast tumor detection with microwave imaging is the contrast in dielectric properties of normal and malignant breast tissues. A method adopting Fourier Transform Matching (FTM) technique and utilizing the reflection coefficient at the aperture of a tapered rectangular waveguide sensor radiating into a breast is described resulting in microwave images that indicate the presence of a tumor. These images demonstrate the feasibility of detecting breast tumors using this approach.

The proposed method consists of an open-source poteniostat and screen printed electrodes. The Current result from the chemical reaction is proportional to the concentration of the Ascorbic Acid. This method was applied to different commercial samples of orange juice and the results were used to determine which one has the most preservation of Ascorbic Acid.	approximation;open-source software;printing	Ahmad Ali;Iman Morsi;Maha Sharkas	2016		10.5220/0005793700580063	computer network;chemical reaction;electrode;orange (colour);computer science;chromatography;cyclic voltammetry	SE	96.30917439695047	-16.93723910224413	197259
5bfce036e7c436c7b9abce84cfa0a3a769a47f13	carbon nanotube-cellulose pellicle for glucose biofuel cell		Carbon nanotube (CNT)-cellulose pellicle was developed to create a conductive CNT network on 20 μm nanostructured cellulose film. The flexible and electrically conductive film was prepared by the modification of bacterial nanocellulose pellicle with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The composite film was further modified with redox enzymes including pyroquinoline quinone glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) and bilirubin oxidase (BODx) functioning as the anodic and cathodic catalyst, respectively with glucose as the biofuel source. The enzyme functionalized MWCNT-cellulose based glucose/O2 biofuel cell system harnessed the biochemical energy of glucose via the oxidation of glucose and reduction of molecular oxygen to generate electrical power in the microwatt range. The biofuel cell system exhibited an open circuit voltage and power density of 470 mV and 46.25 μW/cm2, respectively, with a current density of 381 μA/cm2 in the presence of 25 mM glucose. At physiological glucose concentration, the biofuel cell exhibited an open circuit voltage and power density of 418 mV and 24.975 μW/cm2 respectively, with a current density of 293.75μA/cm2. As a result, we expect that this facile strategy to prepare flexible conductive bioelectrodes for the development of glucose biofuel cell system using synthesized bacterial nanocellulose crosslinked with MWCNTs and enzyme can be readily extended to diverse applications in enzymatic biofuel cell and biosensor technology.	1,4-benzoquinone;bilirubin;biofuels;cetrimonium bromide;carbon dioxide;carbon cycle;cellulose;cross link;dental pellicle;electricity;glucose metabolism disorders;led circuit;nanotubes;nanotubes, carbon;numerous;oxygen;pqq cofactor;pellicle membrane;electrode;glucose dehydrogenase;oxidation;voltage	Md Qumrul Hasan;Jonathan Yuen;Gymama Slaughter	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513229	carbon nanotube;biofuel;cellulose;redox;electronic engineering;catalysis;biosensor;enzymatic biofuel cell;nanocellulose;computer science;inorganic chemistry	EDA	95.35108137672886	-16.927386602565033	198674

Sensitivity to temperature and refractive index are demonstrated, with performances within the range expected for a single LPFG written on a single mode fiber without any enhancing technique. Analysis on results is made based on both theoretical and experimental data.	concatenation;long-period fiber grating;performance;physical vapor deposition;sensor	Marta Nespereira;João M. P.
