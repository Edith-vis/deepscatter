Strong current dependence effect on electromigration lifetime in three levels via terminated metal lines structure was shown. Moreover, different process approach will lead to different EM behavior and related failure mode. Multi-modality electromigration behavior of Cu dual damascene interconnects were studied. Both Superposition and Weak-Link models were used for statistical determination of lifetimes of each failure models (Statistical method). Results were correlated to the lifetimes of respective failure models physically identified according to resistance time evolution behaviors (Physical method). Good agreement was achieved. Various testing structures are designed to identify the EM failure modes. Extensive failure analysis was carried out to understand the failure phenomena of various test structures. The activation energies of failure modes were calculated. The weak links of interconnect system were also identified. A significant improvement of electromigration (EM) lifetime is achieved by modification of the pre-clean step before cap-layer deposition and by changing Cu cap/dielectric materials. A possible mechanism for EM lifetime enhancement was proposed. Cu-silicide formation before cap-layer deposition and adhesion of Cu/cap interface were found to be critical factors in controlling Cu electromigration reliability. The adhesion of the Cu/cap interface can be directly correlated to electromigration MTF and activation energy. Results of present study suggest that interface of Cu interconnects is the key factor for EM performance for advanced BEOL technology design rules. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

312aea7a1c144cef7ebaa0a68c39aa5b0e210ac6	understanding and modeling transient threshold voltage instabilities in sic mosfets		Modeling of the threshold voltage instabilities in SiC power MOSFETs is difficult due to the fast recovery of ΔVth after positive and negative gate bias stress. This work investigates the capture- and emission-time constants of positive and negative charge trapped in the gate oxide and at the interface as a function of gate bias and temperature. We present a measurement technique which enables time-resolved measurements of the real Vth during application-relevant bipolar AC high temperature gate stress (HTGS). We use capture and emission time (CET) maps to model the temperature and voltage dependence of the ΔVth after positive as well as negative gate stress. In addition, we provide a complete modeling approach for the ΔVth after long-term AC stress considering the full stress-history. Furthermore, we present a very accurate model for the short-term hysteresis during a bipolar AC period and we show that the threshold voltage hysteresis has no harmful effect on switching operation in real applications.	bipolar disorder;cephalothin;fever;gate oxide;hysteresis;interface device component;sic protein, streptococcus;sic-povm;standard industrial classification;voltage	Katja Puschkarsky;Tibor Grasser;Thomas Aichinger;Wolfgang Gustin;Hans Reisinger	2018	2018 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)	10.1109/IRPS.2018.8353560	electronic engineering;threshold voltage;voltage;gate oxide;engineering;power mosfet;hysteresis	EDA	90.8513267458718	-11.646177090633154	192560
d68f1a8644e77760e6b4186036adcf91f1323b4a	multi-scale computational framework for evaluating of the performance of molecular based flash cells		In this work we present a multi-scale computational framework for evaluation of statistical variability in a molecular based non-volatile memory cell. As a test case we analyse a BULK flash cell with polyoxometalates (POM) inorganic molecules used as storage centres. We focuse our discussions on the methodology and development of our innovative and unique computational framework. The capability of the discussed multi-scale approach is demonstrated by establishing a link between the threshold voltage variability and current-voltage characteristics with various oxidation states of the POMs. The presented simulation framework and methodology can be applied not only to the POM based flash cell but they are also transferrable to the flash cells based on alternative molecules used as a storage media.	adobe flash;computation;flash memory;mathematical optimization;memory cell (binary);non-volatile memory;numerical analysis;simulation;spatial variability;test case;volatile memory	Vihar P.

The peculiarity of this system is the association of two charging techniques: (1) fluidized bed (dynamic charger) and (2) sliding on inclined plates (static charger)-and two superposed separation units, in order to achieve the selective sorting of a granular mixture composed of three different species of insulating materials. The tests were performed on a mixture of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polycarbonate (PC). A set of tribocharging experiments was conducted for each material, so that to choose the nature of the walls of the static charger. The analysis of the purity of separated products was performed using an image processing program written in MATLAB. High-purity separation (85%, 95%, and 75% for the PVC, PC, and HDPE products, respectively) was obtained at a recovery rate beyond 80%.	battery charger;copper(ii) chloride;electronic waste;experiment;image processing;matlab;pure function;sorting;windows aero	Mohammed Rezoug;Rabah Ouiddir;Wessim Aksa;Karim Medles;Mihai Bilici;Lucian Dascalescu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	10.1109/IAS.2013.6682452	materials science;composite material;forensic engineering;waste management	Visualization	92.74120870418234	-16.704401109051844	193306

For the tunneling dielectric, a 1.7-nm-thick SiNx film was deposited onto the source and drain by a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method. The gate-off current of the TDTFT was reduced less than 1/10 in comparison with a conventional TFT. Although the subthreshold characteristics and the gm were degraded due to the tunnel resistance, it will be compensated by further thinning of SiNx film or using the material with the barrier height lower than SiNx.	chemical vapor deposition;nonlinear system;quantum tunnelling;thickness (graph theory);thin-film transistor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;thinning;transistor–transistor logic;tunneling protocol;vacuum deposition	Naoto Matsuo;Atsushi Fukushima;Kensaku Ohkura;Akira Heya;Shin Yokoyama	2007	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.4.442	electronic engineering;thin-film transistor;electrical engineering;physics;quantum mechanics	HCI	92.09276300705288	-12.482347600558336	194076

Using two starting materials, a crosslinked poly ionic liquid (PIL) and a linear poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-spiropyran-co-acrylic acid), several semi-interpenetrating (sIPN) hydrogels were synthesised. The dimensions of hydrogels discs were measured before and after applying the stimuli, to quantify their response. Samples composed of 100% crosslinked PIL alone showed an average area reduction value of ~53% when the temperature was raised from 20 °C to 70 °C, ~24% when immersed in 1% w/w NaF salt solution and no observable photo-response. In comparison, sIPNs containing 300% w/w linear polymer showed an average area reduction of ~45% when the temperature was raised from 20 °C to 70 °C, ~36% when immersed in 1% NaF w/w salt solution and ~10% after 30 min exposure to white light irradiation, respectively. Moreover, by varying the content of the linear component, fine-control over the photo-, thermo- and salt response, swelling-deswelling rate and mechanical properties of the resulting sIPN was achieved.	amino acids;circa;clinical use template;collagen crosslinked n-telopeptide:scnc:pt:ser:qn;copolymer;cross link;diffusion chambers, culture;digraphs and trigraphs;dimensions;edema;hydrogel;hydrogels;ionic strength;maxima and minima;microfluidics;modulus robot;observable;poly a;polymer;python imaging library;semiconductor industry;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);sodium fluoride;sol-gel;status epilepticus;tellurium;trial elements domain;liter/second;phot	Alexandru Tudor;Larisa Florea;Simon Gallagher;John Burns;Dermot Diamond	2016		10.3390/s16020219	text mining;chemistry;organic chemistry;smart material;nanotechnology;self-healing hydrogels;biological engineering;lower critical solution temperature	HCI	95.18302979271293	-16.759749976197085	194204

This improvement was attributed to the formation of Ce-silicate and thus proper introduction of oxygen vacancies at the interface. The gradual reset process of the W/CeO 2/Si/TiN device under sweeping voltage was quantitatively analyzed by parallel conductive filaments model. Our results provide a guideline for the operation voltage control for further optimizing device performance and give new insights into the gradual reset process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

1a4627d045b7109f1474c29a9bb0de70f5222d3b	interdigitated horizontal electrodes for organic solar cells		"""We first introduce a new electrode structure for organic solar cells (OSCs), the so-called interdigitated horizontal electrode (IHE), in which an electron-collecting electrode and a hole-collecting electrode are horizontally separated. In the IHE, the directions of the incident light and the charge collection are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, the thickness of the photoactive layer is no longer limited by the poor electrical mobility of the carriers in the organic-based photoactive layer. An analysis of the electrical, optical, and electrochemical properties of the IHE is presented. For poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6, 6]-phenyl C<sub>60</sub> butyric acid methyl ester (PC<sub>60</sub>BM)-based IHE OSCs, a proof-of-principle demonstration is performed of their feasibility as electrodes.

Mechanical stress is an important issue because it will directly impact on both the device behaviour and power modules reliability. This paper focuses on the electro-mechanical static characterization of a planar gate IGBT by the help of experiments at controlled temperatures. A specific test bench is proposed to make the experiments on silicone bare dice. It can be highlighted that mechanical stresses have a strong influence on the electrical characteristics of IGBT and this effect is independent from the die temperature. These properties might be a key point to point out an early failure indicator to improve design of the power module.	experiment;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;power module;reliability engineering;test bench	Yassine Belmehdi;Stephane Azzopardi;Jean-Yves Delétage;Eric Woirgard	2010	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2010.07.048	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;stress;forensic engineering;physics;statistics	Robotics	91.01153301728613	-10.090666599779887	195774

However, they have limitations with respect to their actuators and motilities. In this study, we fabricated the two types of flagellated bacteria-actuated microrobots using the flagellated bacteria Serratia marcescens and Salmonella typhimurium that could be utilized as microactuators. First, we fabricated the Serratia marcescens-actuated microrobot, where we adopted the selective bacteria adhering on the surface of SU-8 microcubes through the selective coating with bovine serum albumin. Many number of Serratia marcescens attached on bovine serum albumin-uncoated side of SU-8 microcubes. The average velocity of the selective Serratia marcescens-attached SU-8 microcubes was increased more than two times from SU-8 microcubes with a nominal Serratia marcescens attachments. Second, we fabricated the Salmonella typhimurium-actuated microrobots that have a selective bacteria patterning on the surface of polystyrene microbeads using bovine serum albumin. Similarly, the average velocity of the selective Salmonella typhimurium patterned polystyrene microbeads was 5 folds faster than that of the polystyrene microbeads where the bacteria were attached on the whole surface of the microbeads. Consequently, the experimental results mean that the flagellated bacteria could be utilized as microactuators for microrobots and the selective patterning of the bacteria could enhance the velocity of the bacteria-actuated microrobots.	attachments;microbotics;velocity (software development)	Sung Jun Park;Sunghoon Cho;Young Jin Choi;Han-Earl Jung;Shaohui Zheng;Seong Young Ko;Jong-Oh Park;Sukho Park	2014	5th IEEE RAS/EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics	10.1109/BIOROB.2014.6913886	materials science;nanotechnology;microbiology	Robotics	94.07183612342976	-16.409138101266016	195852

A new method for realization of our proposed technique based on guided modes will present. With our proposed idea one can easily print every kind of two-dimensional patterns.

In order to fabricate high efficiency Si base thin film solar cell, High density (HD) and very high frequency (VHF)-PECVD technologies have been developed for high quality, large scaling ue-Si, µc-SiGe, and µc-SiC film deposition. The high-density and very high frequency plasma technique offers the significant advantages of high plasma density, low plasma potential, and independent control of ion flux and ion bombardment energy which are critical for controlling the bulk and interfacial characteristics of the deposited films. In comparison to other CVD processes, the HD and VHF-PECVD technique offers potential advantages of the deposition of higher growth rates, higher quality films at lower processing temperatures, void free gap filling of high aspect ratio features, self-planarization, lower impurity levels and large scaling capability. The experimental results show typical deposition rate of the µ-Si thin films by HD-PECVD was greater than 10 A/s, the typical microcrystalline volume fraction and the average crystallite size corresponding to &#60;111> orientation were 75% and 160 Å, respectively. Amorphous SiGe and SiC films have been achieved, µc-SiGe, µc-SiC films are under processing. The stabilized efficiency of tandem junction solar cells with a-Si/µc-Si films can reach 12%.	3d film;display resolution;image scaling;multi-junction solar cell;physical vapor deposition;planarization;plasma active;plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition;radeon hd 6000 series;silicon-germanium	Tingkai Li	2011	2011 9th IEEE International Conference on ASIC	10.1109/ASICON.2011.6157212	materials science;ceramic materials;electronic engineering;thin film	Visualization	92.6813967594683	-14.0928535713275	197613

Its potential for ultrahigh storage density has been demonstrated by a new thermomechanical local-probe technique to store and read back data in very thin polymer films. With this new technique, 30–40-nm-sized bit indentations of similar pitch size have been made by a single cantilever/tip in a thin (50-nm) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer, resulting in a data storage density of 400–500 Gb/in.2 High data rates are achieved by parallel operation of large two-dimensional (2D) AFM arrays that have been batch-fabricated by silicon surface-micromachining techniques. The very large scale integration (VLSI) of micro/nanomechanical devices (cantilevers/tips) on a single chip leads to the largest and densest 2D array of 32 × 32 (1024) AFM cantilevers with integrated write/read storage functionality ever built. Time-multiplexed electronics control the write/read storage cycles for parallel operation of the Millipede array chip. Initial areal densities of 100–200 Gb/in.2 have been achieved with the 32 × 32 array chip, which has potential for further improvements. In addition to data storage in polymers or other media, and not excluding magnetics, we envision areas in nanoscale science and technology such as lithography, high-speed/large-scale imaging, molecular and atomic manipulation, and many others in which Millipede may open up new perspectives and opportunities.	atomic-force microscopy	Peter Vettiger;Michel Despont;Ute Drechsler;Urs Duerig;Walter Häberle;Mark I.

add038311fa505427b5a23e38cbc878007e71cb4	temperature dependence of self-healing characteristics of metallized polypropylene film		Thermal aging is one of the main failure mechanisms in metallized polypropylene film capacitors (MPPFCs). Also, catastrophic failure is more likely to happen under elevated working temperature. Elevated temperature will accelerate the aging process of the dielectric, reduce the dielectric strength of polypropylene and influence the self-healing characteristics of metallized polypropylene film (MPPF). In this paper, the lifetime of MPPFCs under different voltage and working temperature is tested, and with a well-designed self-healing experiment bench, self-healing experiment under 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 85 °C are performed. It is found that the lifetime decreases and catastrophic failure rate increases apparently with the rise of temperature. And the self-healing energy under the same breakdown voltage becomes larger under higher temperature. In this paper, the influence of temperature on self-healing characteristics and capacitor working performance are investigated.

They survive temperatures over 1000 °C. Compared with regenerated FBGs fabricated in the same type of fibre, the evolution curves of LPGs during regeneration and post-annealing reveal even more detail of glass relaxation. Piece-wise temperature dependence is observed, indicating the onset of a phase transition of glass in the core and inner cladding at ~500 °C and ~250 °C, and the melting of inner cladding between 860 °C and 900 °C. An asymmetric spectral response with increasing and decreasing annealing temperature points to the complex process dependent material system response. Resonant wavelength tuning by adjusting the dwell temperature at which regeneration is undertaken is demonstrated, showing a shorter resonant wavelength and shorter time for stabilisation with higher dwell temperatures. All the regenerated LPGs are nearly strain-insensitive and cannot be tuned by applying loads during annealing as done for regenerated FBGs."""	behavior;boron;cladding (fiber optics);clinical regeneration;glass;linear programming relaxation;national land and property gazetteer;natural regeneration;one thousand;onset (audio);optical fiber;phase transition;simulated annealing;softening;tissue fiber;waveguide device component;wavelength	Wen Liu;Kevin Cook;John Canning	2015		10.3390/s150820659	transition temperature;text mining;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;nanotechnology;optics;forensic engineering	ML	96.6761128609516	-15.428603346602946	199312

The first two of these structures are the same as those in RTDs oscillating at 1.04 THz reported recently, and the last structure provided for further reduction of the transit time and increase in frequency due to suppression of the &Gamma;-L transition and increment of the launching velocity.
