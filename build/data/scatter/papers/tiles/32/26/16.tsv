In particular, in [1] it is shown that a series of three statespace basis transformations, determined in connection wit h the maximal output nulling controlled invariant subspace and a friend linear map, results in a repr es ntation of the system where the structure of the minimum-phase invariant zeros is caught by a certain pair of matrices. Hence, the linear maps associated with those matrices are used to de fine the feedforward compensator achieving zero cancellation while retaining some special p roperties of the original system, such as stabilizability and right-invertibility. In this note, three numerical examples are presented. The fir st example is worked out in detail, with the aim of illustrating every single step of the applica t on of the procedure proposed in [1]. The second example is borrowed from the literature, with the purpose of comparing the results obtained with the techniques described in [1] to those provi ded by the approach introduced in [3]. As to the third example, it has been known for a long time that z ero assignment can effectively be exploited to improve the transient response of a control s ystem [4]. Thus, the third example is devised in order to show how a slight modification of the met hod discussed in [1] leads to a feedforward compensator that not only attains zero cancell ation with the additional constraints	feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;linear time-invariant theory;map;maximal set;minimum phase;numerical analysis;time complexity;time-invariant system	Elena Zattoni	2013	CoRR		control engineering;econometrics;control theory;mathematics	Vision	68.76709300135502	5.087992782720213	191955

A detailed analysis of the properties of the constituent rank constrained linear matrix inequalities, when the nominal system has an LQG-balanced state-space realisation, reveals that it is possible to construct a feasible point directly for a particular choice of reduced order and ν-gap error. This gives rise to a step-wise procedure, based on constructing an optimal approximant at each step. While as of yet, the freedom in the parameterisation of optimal approximants has not been exploited, the new step-wise technique developed in this paper appears to perform well for numerical examples, yielding approximants between the upper and lower bounds for approximation in the ν-gap metric.	approximation	Gavin Buskes;Michael Cantoni	2008		10.1109/CDC.2008.4738771	linear-quadratic-gaussian control;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;linear matrix inequality;state space;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;upper and lower bounds;approximation algorithm	Robotics	69.24441451030981	4.591464695001323	192448

de48bc15576319c135b0b738f70d93caccf103cc	partial quadratic eigenvalue assignment with velocity-plus-acceleration feedback in vibrating structures using the receptance and the system matrices		The paper provides a method for solving the partial eigenstructure assignment problems using state-derivative feedback for second-order dynamic systems. Just computing feedback matrices is not enough in real-life applications. Both closed-loop eigenvalue sensitivity and feedback norms are as small as possible. In this work, a hybrid method combining the system matrices and measured receptances is proposed. The hybrid method is more efficient than the standards methods which only use the system matrices and not the receptances. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	dynamical system;feedback;numerical analysis;real life;velocity (software development)	Lin Zhou;Bingjie Li;Mingfa Zheng	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI)	10.1109/ICSAI.2017.8248261	robustness (computer science);computer science;control theory;acceleration;dynamical system;quadratic equation;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;symmetric matrix;matrix (mathematics)	Robotics	70.39186408813632	9.252478592362715	192690

Homogeneous systems in the generalized sense are a very large class of nonlinear systems, including (lower and upper) triangular systems. Exploiting this extension we give basic results concerning stabilization and robustness of nonlinear systems which have a generalized homogeneous approximation at zero and at the origin.	approximation;block cipher mode of operation;map;nonlinear system;triple des	Stefano Battilotti	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7039745	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	70.87191425730055	4.392348119996294	193827

However, due to mathematical limitation of the employed algorithm, the equation solvability problem emerges in the computation of different virtual exchange rates. This paper provides a solution to identify the solvability problem in the virtual money exchange system and an algorithm to solve this problem by minimally removing unmatched supplies. Evaluation result shows that with this algorithm, the transaction histories can be maximally reserved for the sake of future exchange rate prediction.	algorithm;computation;linear system;virtual economy;virtual world	Bingqing Shen;Jingzhi Guo;C.

For this purpose we use a fixed point algorithm and provide a function whose fixed points correspond to decay points of the monotone operator. This decay point plays a crucial role in checking, in a semi-global fashion, the local input-to-state stability of an interconnected system numerically and in the numerical construction of local input-to-state stability (LISS) Lyapunov functions. We give some improvements of this algorithm and show the advantage to an earlier approach based on the algorithm of Eaves.	lyapunov fractal	Roman Geiselhart;Fabian R.

Since the natural geometric background is a Riemannian manifold, we begin by generalizing La Salle theorems about the stability of equilibrium points of dynamical systems to a complete Riemannian manifold. The stability of dissipative mechanical systems is studied using the particular geometric properties of the tangent bundle, and passivity based controls are designed to stabilize equilibrium points. The case of partially dissipative systems is formulated and used with a dynamical extension to design controls for bringing the system to a desired point of the phase space.		Miguel C.
