The idea consists of estimating the domain of attraction via the union of a continuous family of Lyapunov estimates rather than via one Lyapunov estimate only as done in existing methods. This family is obtained through a convex LMI optimization by deriving a stability condition which takes simultaneously into account all considered Lyapunov functions. Moreover, inner approximations of the union of this family via a set with simple shape are also derived.	lyapunov fractal	Graziano Chesi	2007	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2006.10.012	equilibrium point;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;convex optimization;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov function;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign;lyapunov exponent;attractor	Robotics	72.65085350073025	-2.416294077443947	181369

In this technical note we analyze the robustness of such nonlinear schemes to the presence of multiple, non-commensurate (heterogeneous) communication delays.	centralized computing;internet;mathematical optimization;network congestion;nonlinear system	Antonis Papachristodoulou;Ali Jadbabaie	2010	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2010.2044262	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;control theory;mathematics	Networks	74.20700812324137	-1.3616550115663	181747

Based on this new tool of nonsmooth analysis, we first obtain a couple of general results concerning the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point. Then those results are applied to show that existence assumptions on the equilibrium point in some existing sufficient conditions ensuring GAS are actually unnecessary; and some strong assumptions such as the boundedness of activation functions in some other existing sufficient conditions can be actually dropped. Finally, we derive some new sufficient conditions which are easy to check. Comparison with some related existing results is conducted and advantages are illustrated with examples. Throughout our paper, spectral properties of the matrix (A + Atau) play an important role, which is a distinguished feature from previous studies. Here, A and Atau are, respectively, the feedback and the delayed feedback matrix defining the neural network under consideration.

The proposed LMI conditions can be checked easily by recently developed algorithms solving LMIs.

1fb0d2b95bbfa74bc4ef0719c6b5d6d21504d78f	adaptive lag synchronization of memristive neural networks with mixed delays		This paper investigates the lag synchronization of memristive neural networks (MNNs) with mixed delays via adaptive control. Based on the switching jump properties of memristors and the assumption that the activation functions are bounded, three lemmas are derived first to deal with the theoretical analysis difficulties caused by the existences of time delays and time lag. By designing a series of suitable adaptive controllers, we prove that the considered MNNs can achieve asymptotic lag synchronization, exponential lag synchronization, and finite-time lag synchronization, respectively. Adaptive control can avoid the large control gains very well, and adaptive control can be used even when the system parameters are unknown. Moreover, extra calculations are not required to determine the appropriate control gains. Numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.	activation function;artificial neural network;memristor;numerical linear algebra;simulation;time complexity	Chuan Yong Chen;Lixiang Li;Haipeng Peng;Yixian Yang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2858246	memristor;computer science;distributed computing;artificial neural network;control theory;bounded function;adaptive control;synchronization;exponential function;jump;lag	HPC	72.73784688319742	1.3910410145741579	182774

This allows one to study the finite limit cycles (which are of length one or two), the transient behavior in the finite case, and also to write down explicit integral functionals. The existence of $( H( x( t ) ) )$ is important for a physical approach to the study of these automata networks. The condition that f be cyclically monotone in $\mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to f increasing and is usually used in applications to computer sciences.	automaton;lyapunov fractal;monotone	Eric Goles Ch.;A.

By using fixed point theory and set-valued analysis, we establish the existence theorem of equilibrium point. In order to stabilize the states of this class of discontinuous DNNs in finite time, we design two different kinds of switching controllers which are described by discontinuous functions. Under the framework of Filippov solutions, several new and effective criteria are derived to realize finite-time stabilization of discontinuous DNNs based on the famous finite-time stability theory. Besides, the upper bounds of the settling time of stabilization are estimated. Numerical examples are finally provided to illustrate the correctness of the proposed design method and theoretical results.	activation function;appendix;arabic numeral 0;artificial neural network;behavior;bifurcation theory;chaos theory;complex network;controllers;correctness (computer science);differential inclusion;dynamical system;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point number;fixed-point arithmetic;fixed-point theorem;inclusion bodies;kind of quantity - equilibrium;neural network simulation;neuron;neurons;numerical method;ocular orbit;paper;settling time;solutions;stochastic neural network	Lingling Zhang;Lihong Huang;Zuowei Cai	2016	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2015.11.009	differential inclusion;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	ML	73.99916785645293	2.5959185218633434	183725

The sufficient condition for the existence of controller and H^~ state feedback controller design methods are presented. Also, using some changes of variables and Schur complements, the obtained sufficient condition can be rewritten as an LMI form in terms of transformed variables.

737a5298036845b9fe73511370e25f6a8a8e14f3	on the almost global stability of invariant sets		For a given invariant set of a dynamical system, it is known that the existence of a Lyapunov-type density function, called Lyapunov density or Rantzer's density function, may imply the convergence of almost all solutions to the invariant set, in other words, the almost global stability (also called almost everywhere stability) of the invariant set. For discrete-time systems, related results in literature assume that the state space is compact and the invariant set has a local basin of attraction. We show that these assumptions are redundant. Using the duality between Frobenius-Perron and Koopman operators, we provide a Lyapunov density theorem for discrete-time systems without assuming the compactness of the state space or any local attraction property of the invariant set. As a corollary to this new discrete-time Lyapunov density theorem, we provide a continuous-time Lyapunov density theorem which can be used as an alternative to Rantzer's original theorem, especially where the solutions are known to exist globally.

Combined with the result about distribution of zeros of analytic function, some new sufficient conditions are derived which give bounds of the absolute values of the roots of a quasi-critical polynomial.

These systems do not have a strict-feedback structure and thus the standard backstepping approach cannot be applied. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the backstepping-forwarding transform are given in terms of spectral properties of some integral operators and, more conservatively but easily verifiable, in terms of the norms of the coefficients in the equations. An explicit transform is given for particular coefficient structures. In the case of strict-feedback systems, the procedure detailed in this paper reduces to the well-known backstepping design. The results are illustrated with numerical simulations.	boundary element method;coefficient;computer simulation;first-order predicate;formal verification;numerical analysis;whole earth 'lectronic link	Federico Bribiesca Argomedo;Miroslav Krstic	2015	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2015.2398882	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;kernel;fredholm theory;laplace transform applied to differential equations;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;fredholm integral equation;integral equation;integral transform	Embedded	70.774757953121	0.4565526386081238	186795

We focus on constructing a weak (nonstrictly decreasing) Lyapunov function for the overall hybrid system from weak ISS-Lyapunov functions for the subsystems in the interconnection. Asymptotic stability of the hybrid system is then concluded by applying results of LaSalle type. The utility of this approach is illustrated on feedback systems arising in event-triggered control and quantized control.	feedback;hybrid system;interconnection;lyapunov fractal;quantization (signal processing)	Daniel Liberzon;Dragan Nesic;Andrew R.

As a continuous attractor is the infinite equilibria, the connected matrix needs to be nonsingular. Therefore, RNN is transformed into a lower dimensional RNN using elementary operation. Firstly, based on the foregoing results some continuous attractors of RNN with real-valued weights are obtained. Secondly, continuous attractors of RNN with complex-valued weights are obtained by studying the corresponding RNN with real-valued weights.

Fixed-time synchronization means that synchronization can be achieved in a fixed time for any initial values of the considered systems. In the light of the double-layer structure of MBAMNNs, we design two similar feedback controllers. Based on Lyapunov stability theories, several criteria are established to guarantee that the drive and response MBAMNNs can realize synchronization in a fixed time. In particular, by changing the parameters of controllers, this fixed time can be adjusted to some desired value in advance, irrespective of the initial values of MBAMNNs. Numerical simulations are included to validate the derived results.

By designing a variable-substitution and feedback controller, a master-slave finite-time synchronization scheme for the Lur’e systems with time delay is built up. Two delay-independent global lagged finite-time synchronization criteria are proved in the forms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the corresponding settling time of synchronization is analytically estimated. The obtained LMI criteria are applied to Chua’s oscillators, obtaining some easily implemented algebraic criteria under various single-variablesubstitution and feedback controller, which are then optimized to improve their conservative property. Finally, several numerical examples are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the optimized criteria.	broadcast delay;chua's circuit;control theory;digraphs and trigraphs;feedback;linear algebra;linear matrix inequality;master/slave (technology);nl (complexity);nl-complete;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;settling time	Yun Chen;Xiaofeng Wu;Qian Lin	2015	I.

The initial conditions are given by control functions. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique solution of such hyperbolic equations with the Neumann boundary conditions are presented. The performance functional has the quadratic form. The time horizon T is fixed. Finally, we impose some constraints on the control. Making use of the Lions scheme [8], necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality for the Neumann problem with the quadratic performance functional and constrained control are derived.	broadcast delay;control function (econometrics);initial condition;mathematical optimization;optimal control	Adam Kowalewski	2011	2013 18th International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2011.6031347	mathematical optimization;optimal control;boundary value problem	Robotics	68.48476431343506	3.924190063534767	192944

For systems with polynomial dynamics and compact semialgebraic state and control constraints, we describe a hierarchy of finite-dimensional linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxations whose optimal values converge to the volume of the MCI set; dual to these LMI relaxations are sum-ofsquares (SOS) problems providing a converging sequence of outer approximations to the MCI set. The approach is simple and readily applicable in the sense that the approximations are the outcome of a single semidefinite program with no additional input apart from the problem description. A number of numerical examples illustrate the approach.	approximation;computation;converge;dynamical system;linear matrix inequality;linear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial;semidefinite programming;social inequality	Milan Korda;Didier Henrion;Colin Neil Jones	2014	SIAM J.

The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point is proved by using the Homomorphic mapping theorem. The asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point is established by employing the Lyapunov stability theorems. The obtained robust stability condition establishes a new relationship between the network parameters of the system. We compare our stability result with the previous corresponding robust stability results derived in the past literature.

First, we design a full-state feedback law with actuation on only one end of the domain and prove exponential stability of the closed-loop system. Then, we construct a collocated boundary observer which only needs measurements on the controlled end and prove convergence of observer estimates. Both results are combined to obtain a collocated output feedback law. The backstepping method is used to obtain both control and observer kernels. The kernels are the solution of a 4 × 4 system of first-order hyperbolic linear PDEs with spatially varying coefficients of Goursat type, whose well-posedness is shown.	block cipher mode of operation;coefficient;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;time complexity;well-posed problem	Rafael Vazquez;Miroslav Krstic;Jean-Michel Coron	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160338	control engineering;mathematical optimization;boundary value problem;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability	Robotics	70.60311547771357	0.16295395366368506	196141

The singular system to be controlled is not assumed to be regular. A regular dynamic output feedback controller is designed such that a prescribed H∞ performance condition is satis4ed and the closed-loop poles are placed in a speci4ed disk while the regularity, causality and stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed for all admissible uncertainties. The desired controller can be obtained by solving a set of matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. c © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

According to Lyapunov theory, such two nonlinear recurrent neural networks are proved to be convergent within finite-time. Besides, by solving differential equation, the upper bounds of the finite convergence time are determined analytically. Compared with existing recurrent neural networks, the proposed two nonlinear recurrent neural networks have a better convergence property (i.e., the upper bound is lower), and thus the accurate solutions of general time-varying LMEs can be obtained with less time. At last, various different situations have been considered by setting different coefficient matrices of general time-varying LMEs and a great variety of computer simulations (including the application to robot manipulators) have been conducted to validate the better finite-time convergence of the proposed two nonlinear recurrent neural networks.

Firstly, based on Homomorphic mapping theory and nonsmooth analysis approach, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point are proved. Secondly, by applying linear matrix inequality (LMI), free-weighting matrix technique, and available Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, some delaydependent conditions are achieved in terms of LMIs to ensure the considered neural network to be globally robustly exponentially stable. The results obtained in this paper are little conservative compared with the previous results in the literature.

Specifically, given positive, ordered numbers (frequencies), we develop a procedure for constructing a stable degree monic polynomial with real coefficients. This construction can be viewed as a mapping from the space of ordered frequencies to the space of stable degree monic polynomials. The mapping is one–one and onto, thereby giving a complete parameterization of all stable, degree monic polynomials. We show how the result can be used to generate parameterizations of stabilizing fixedorder proper controllers for unity feedback systems. We apply these results in the development of stability margin lower bounds for systems with parameter uncertainty.	coefficient;mathematical optimization;monic polynomial;robust control;search algorithm	Theodore E.

First, the strict S-Lemma is extended from quadratic forms to homogeneous functions with respect to any dilation, where the improved S-Lemma is named the strict homogeneous S-Lemma (SHS-Lemma). In detail, this paper indicates that the strict S-Lemma does not necessarily hold for homogeneous functions that are not quadratic forms, and proposes a necessary and sufficient condition under which the SHS-Lemma holds. It is well known that a switched linear system with two subsystems admits a Lyapunov function with homogeneous derivative (LFHD) if and only if it has a convex combination of the vector fields of its two subsystems that admits a LFHD. In this paper, it is shown that this conclusion does not necessarily hold for a general switched nonlinear system with two subsystems, and gives a necessary and sufficient condition under ...	nonlinear system	Kuize Zhang;Lijun Zhang;Fuchun Sun	2014	SIAM J.
