701dc29837d07f058b87ef2e67444adf428704f1	a methodology for the numerical computation of normal forms, centre manifolds and first integrals of hamiltonian systems	first integrals;hamiltonian system;numerical computation;invariant tori;normal form;algebraic manipulators;first integral;celestial mechanics;hamiltonian mechanics;normal forms;software implementation;centre manifolds	This paper deals with the e ective computation of normal forms, centre manifolds and rst integrals in Hamiltonian mechanics. These kind of calculations are very useful since they allow, for instance, to give explicit estimates on the di usion time or to compute invariant tori. The approach presented here is based on using algebraic manipulation for the formal series but taking numerical coe cients for them. This, jointly with a very e cient implementation of the software, allows big savings in both memory and execution time of the algorithms if we compare with the use of commercial algebraic manipulators. The algorithms are presented jointly with their C/C++ implementations, and they are applied to some concrete examples coming from celestial mechanics.	algorithm;c++;celestial coordinate system;computation;database normalization;linear algebra;numerical analysis;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Angel Jorba	1999	Experimental Mathematics	10.1080/10586458.1999.10504397	hamiltonian system;celestial mechanics;mathematical analysis;topology;database normalization;mathematics;geometry;hamiltonian mechanics;algebra	Logic	70.5864401422436	16.251738667763558	192025
726d0e20d6f8bc88b02037973e105445eff058ab	a neurodynamic approach to nonlinear optimization problems with affine equality and convex inequality constraints	global convergence;lyapunov function;nonlinear optimization problems;recurrent neural network	This paper presents a neurodynamic approach to nonlinear optimization problems with affine equality and convex inequality constraints. The proposed neural network endows with a time-varying auxiliary function, which can guarantee that the state of the neural network enters the feasible region in finite time and remains there thereafter. Moreover, the state with any initial point is shown to be convergent to the critical point set when the objective function is generally nonconvex. Especially, when the objective function is pseudoconvex (or convex), the state is proved to be globally convergent to an optimal solution of the considered optimization problem. Compared with other neural networks for related optimization problems, the proposed neural network in this paper has good convergence and does not depend on some additional assumptions, such as the assumption that the inequality feasible region is bounded, the assumption that the penalty parameter is sufficiently large and the assumption that the objective function is lower bounded over the equality feasible region. Finally, some numerical examples and an application in real-time data reconciliation are provided to display the well performance of the proposed neural network.

4251d59aa6dcfe378aac9e8995c76144f78a73b3	3d weak lensing with spin wavelets on the ball		We construct the spin flaglet transform, a wavelet transform to analyze spin signals in three dimensions. Spin flaglets can probe signal content localized simultaneously in space and frequency and, moreover, are separable so that their angular and radial properties can be controlled independently. They are particularly suited to analyzing of cosmological observations such as the weak gravitational lensing of galaxies. Such observations have a unique 3D geometrical setting since they are natively made on the sky, have spin angular symmetries, and are extended in the radial direction by additional distance or redshift information. Flaglets are constructed in the harmonic space defined by the Fourier-Laguerre transform, previously defined for scalar functions and extended here to signals with spin symmetries. Thanks to various sampling theorems, both the Fourier-Laguerre and flaglet transforms are theoretically exact when applied to bandlimited signals. In other words, in numerical computations the only loss of information is due to the finite representation of floating point numbers. We develop a 3D framework relating the weak lensing power spectrum to covariances of flaglet coefficients. We suggest that the resulting novel flaglet weak lensing estimator offers a powerful alternative to common 2D and 3D approaches to accurately capture cosmological information. While standard weak lensing analyses focus on either real or harmonic space representations (i.e., correlation functions or Fourier-Bessel power spectra, respectively), a wavelet approach inherits the advantages of both techniques, where both complicated sky coverage and uncertainties associated with the physical modeling of small scales can be handled effectively. Our codes to compute the Fourier-Laguerre and flaglet transforms are made publicly available.	angularjs;bandlimiting;bessel filter;code;coefficient;computation;numerical analysis;radial (radio);redshift;sampling (signal processing);spectral density;wavelet transform	Boris Leistedt;Jason D.

One of the predecessors has lower structural complexity but were not shown to be capable of solving degenerate QP problems including LP problems while the other does not have this limitation but has higer structural complexity. The proposed model inherits the merits of both models and thus serves as a competitive alternative for solving QP and LP problems. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the model and validate the theoretical results.	artificial neural network;computational fluid dynamics;linear programming;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;quadratic programming;recurrent neural network;simulation;structural complexity (applied mathematics)	Xiaolin Hu;Bo Zhang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01513-7_13	mathematical optimization;structural complexity;von neumann stability analysis;second-order cone programming;computer science;linear programming;recurrent neural network;machine learning;mathematics;quadratic programming;algorithm	ML	69.68972611079744	12.709513137285951	195024

Such a procedure is considered by Rice [4, pp. 12-15]. In the case of linear approximation such a procedure has been shown to converge [1, pp. 84-88]. It has been claimed by Watson [5] that the procedure works for approxition by nonlinear families.	algorithm;converge;linear approximation;minimax;nonlinear system	Charles B. Dunham	1972	Commun.

In such a mode of operation no special requirements on template stability properties are needed. We propose a constructive back propagation based algorithm for template design. For a given number of iterations we can find optimal sequence of templates for a given problem to be solved. Our novel approach is demonstrated by a design of a digit recognition DT-CNN.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;block cipher mode of operation;cellular neural network;iteration;pdf/a;requirement;software propagation	Christian Merkwirth;Jochen Bröcker;Maciej Ogorzalek;Jörg D.

The singularities of the fundamental solutions lie outside of Ω. The domains under consideration satisfy a rather mild boundary regularity requirement, namely the Segment Condition. We study approximations with respect to the norms of the spaces Ck(Ω), Ck,σ(Ω) and Wk,p(Ω), and we establish density and non–density results for elliptic operators with constant coefficients. We also provide applications of our density results related to the method of fundamental solutions and to the theory of universal series.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;method of fundamental solutions	Yiorgos Sokratis Smyrlis	2009	Journal of Approximation Theory	10.1016/j.jat.2008.11.018	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;topology;mathematics;elliptic partial differential equation	ML	74.65824910335712	15.764471281578336	199858
