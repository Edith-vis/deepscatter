Condition on limiting variation of the Lyapunov function is given for input-to-state asymptotic stability of switched systems with switching jumps. The control objective is achieved uniformly with respect to a class of switching signals. The coupled difficulties from the discrepancy between control gains and switching jumps are overcome by discontinuous adaptive neural control combined with the classical adaptive control. Smooth approximations of the discontinuous controls are then presented for a systematic design procedure.	nonlinear system	Thanh-Trung Han;Shuzhi Sam Ge;Tong Heng Lee	2009	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2008.09.002	control engineering;variable structure control;systems modeling;adaptive control;backstepping;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	72.36526857290828	-4.4091115052222865	181466

For doing this, we use the key concept of weakly invariant tubes and we give a new compactness property for weakly invariant tubes with values in a prescribed collection of sets. We give some consequences of this property on the minimal time function to reach the target, and we prove a sufficient condition for the attainability of the target by weakly invariant tubes of the considered system. If the attainability property is not satisfied, we characterize a subcollection of initial sets from which the attainability property holds true, and we provide an algorithm to compute it.	nonlinear system	Sylvain Rigal	2005		10.1007/11666806_27	control engineering;control theory;mathematics;algorithm	Robotics	72.4201173905579	-3.1972791576349486	181588

By utilizing the general framework for tackling the output regulation problem , the output regulation problem is converted into a global robust stabilization problem for a class of feedforward systems that is subject to both time-varying static and dynamic uncertainties. Then the stabilization problem is solved by using a small gain based bottom-up recursive design procedure.	bottom-up parsing;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;recursion;top-down and bottom-up design	Tianshi Chen;Jie Huang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2009.2024377	robust control;control engineering;regulation;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;nonlinear system;engineering;automation;top-down and bottom-up design;control theory;mathematics;feed forward;robustness	Visualization	71.6799774346664	-3.9746104628319823	183687

We focus on a practically implementable design with robustness to model uncertainties and disturbances. A discretetime sliding mode gradient estimator is developed for estimating the gradient of the performance profile. Based on the estimate, a variable structure output feedback regulator is proposed to enforce the system states toward the optimal trajectory. We analyze convergence conditions of the switching system toward a neighborhood of the optimal trajectory, and establish an ultimate bound on the size of the neighborhood. The robustness of the proposed controller is discussed with respect to measurement noise. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is assumed that the adjustable parameters of the 2-DOF PID controller are chosen so as to minimize the two performance indices for step reference and disturbance responses, which are maximized by the plant parameters belonging to a given bounded set. Thus, the design problem is formulated as a multi-objective minimax optimization problem, which is solved by new genetic algorithm (GA). A novel feature of the present paper lies in the exact robust stability check for time-delay systems without using approximant. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the present approach.	pid	Tohru Kawabe;Takanori Tagami	2006	Control and Intelligent Systems	10.2316/Journal.201.2006.3.201-1559	pid controller;robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;step response	Robotics	72.7437557255088	-4.487095297337218	184672

In a shallow water environment, significant disturbances due to shallow water waves affect the motion of marine vehicles greatly. Since it is not energy efficient to counteract the oscillatory disturbances due to waves, it is critical to obtain the wave information or wave induced disturbance information and design an energy efficient controller to reduce the action of actuators to counteract wave disturbances to avoid wear and tear on actuators. In this article, a non-linear observer is first designed to estimate the low frequency (LF) motion of AUVs and to filter out wave-frequency (WF) motion of AUVs due to shallow water wave by using position and attitude measurements. Based on the designed observer, a non-linear output feedback controller is subsequently derived by using the observer backstepping technique.

Input shaping, a feed-forward method, typically convolves the input with a sequence of impulses that are independent of the system maneuver. While reducing the residual vibration, input shaping extends the duration of the maneuver command by the length of the input shaper. This paper explores the idea of adaptive input shaping which allows a fast input shaper to be used while providing robustness to parameter uncertainty by tuning the shaper to the #exible mode frequency. The adaptive input shaping method presented can adapt between maneuvers or during maneuvers. Analysis yields a large range of convergence that is veri7ed by simulation and shows this method to be less complex than other adaptive approaches. ? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, many robust control algorithms utilize the inverse dynamics of the plant to be controlled.

The occurrence of actuator faults is modeled as a Markov chain to predict future faults. A compatible relationship of H∞ controllers is proposed for successive fault modes. In order to shrink the set of all H∞ controllers, seven methods are presented to construct a small set of controllers for different demands. Then five selection schemes are proposed to choose a proper controller from a given set of controllers for a given fault mode. Another selection scheme and a pre-selection scheme are presented when there might be false fault detection and identification. Considered together, they provide a powerful solution for all kinds of demands. A motivating example is used to illustrate the proposed methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

be1df4197ef161bc89749a0d8d23d71df9594130	parabolic sliding mode filtering with feed-forward compensation		In motion control systems, feedback signals are often corrupted by noise because of environmental disturbances and measurement errors. Thus, filters are necessary to remove noise to obtain reliable signals. This paper proposes a new sliding mode filter that possesses a parabolic-shaped sliding surface. The proposed filter is an extension of a Jin et al.'s parabolic sliding mode filter by including feed-forward compensating terms for accelerating the tracking speed between the output and the input. Its discrete-time algorithm is developed by using the backward Euler discretization, and its discrete-time implementation does not produce chattering. A numerical example is executed for validating the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed filter.

Problems with long input delays, for unstable plants, represent a particular challenge. In fact, they were the first challenge to be dealt with, in Otto J. M. Smith’s article (Smith, 1959), where a compensator, now known as the Smith predictor, was introduced five decades ago. The Smith predictor’s value is in its ability to compensate for a long input or output delay in set point regulation or constant disturbance rejection problems. However, its major limitation is that, when the plant is unstable, it fails to recover the stabilizing property of a nominal controller for the plant without delay. A substantial modification to the Smith predictor, which removes its limitation to stable plants was developed three decades ago in the form of finite spectrum assignment (FSA) controllers (Artstein, 1982; Kwon & Pearson, 1980; Manitius & Olbrot, 1979). More recent treatment of this subject can be found in the books (Michiels & Niculescu, 2007; Zhong, 2006a).

The proposed control schemes are based on the dynamic game problem of a finite-horizon cost function with a fixed finite terminal weighting matrix and a one-horizon cost function with time-varying finite terminal weighting matrices, respectively. We show that the resulting RHHCs guarantee closed-loop stability in the absence of disturbances and H/sub /spl infin// norm bound for 2-norm bounded disturbances. We also show that the proposed schemes can easily be implemented via linear matrix inequality optimization. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes through simulations.

The assignable energy functions are characterized by a set of partial differential equations that must be solved to determine the control law. We prove in this paper that for a class of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one the partial differential equations can be explicitly solved. Furthermore, we introduce a suitable parametrization of assignable energy functions that provides the designer with a handle to address transient performance and robustness issues. Finally, we develop a speed estimator that allows the implementation of position-feedback controllers. The new result is applied to obtain an (almost) globally stabilizing scheme for the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with strong input coupling, and a controller for the pendulum in a cart that can swing-up the pendulum from any position in the upper half plane and stop the cart at any desired location. In both cases we obtain very simple and intuitive position-feedback solutions.	coupling (computer programming);interconnection;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal control;underactuation	José Ángel Acosta;Romeo Ortega;Alessandro Astolfi;Arun D.

In this paper we propose an output feedback control law that directly uses a single vector measurement and gyro, and without any need for estimating the satellite attitude. The output feedback gain is computed by solving a generalized Riccati time varying differential equation. We assume the moment-of-inertia matrix of satellite is unknown. The controller guarantees asymptotic convergence of the attitude to its desired value. A realistic simulation is presented where a magnetometer is used to provide the single vector measurement.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback;gyro;optimal control;simulation	Fatemeh Safaei;Mehrzad Namvar	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426764	control engineering;electronic engineering;magnetometer;convergence;system of measurement;control theory;feedback;mathematics;attitude control;differential equation;satellite	Robotics	68.98091332284477	-6.58708451163172	190473

It is well known that the most fundamental characteristic of a linear system is the validity of the principle of superposition. Such systems are described by linear differential equations with real constant coefficients. Furthermore, in the analysis and design of linear control systems, the output is well behaved, that is, if its input is excited by a sinusoidal signal, the output is likewise a sinusoidal signal of different phase and amplitude, but of the same frequency. The frequency response methods of Nyquist and Bode represent powerful tools in linear design. Also, the question of stability is clearly defined in these systems. Frequently, however, feedback control systems possess nonlinearities, inherent or inserted, which are not linear in the sense that they can be described by a linear differential equation. More precisely, and as the author of the present book points out, nonlinearities occur in all physical systems. In nonlinear systems, the principle of superposition is not usually valid, and the frequencies present in the output may not be those of the input. As stated in the preface, the aim of this book is to apply describing function methods to the analysis of nonlinear feedback control systems. This authoritative book is the culmination of several years of teaching and research by Prof. Atherton.

Indeed, classical control design frequently used loopshaping ideas, which, though in an ad hoc way, took account of the need to balance various conflicting requirements, including the constraints dictated by Bode gain-phase relation. Modern control design makes use of more sophisticated tools that allow more complex situations to be handled, but these tools run the danger of obscuring insight otherwise useful for design. Performance limitation studies serve as an adjunct to modern control tools. They help a control system designer specify reasonable goals, and understand the inherent limits of a design and the interplay between conflicting design requirements. The understanding of performance limitations thus promises to be of intrinsic as well as practical value. With this perspective, we felt that it is both useful and timely to gather the contemporary research developments in this area of long history and yet continuing vitality. What do we mean by “performance limitations of feedback control?” What is the importance of this area? What new contributions has the area brought to the theory and practice of control engineering? To answer these questions, we describe a philosophy of feedback control that we think is valuable in practical applications. This philosophy is based in part on our observations that: 1) it is rare, in practical control applications to complicated systems, that control design is a single cycle of modelling, performance specification, controller synthesis and implementation, but instead an iterative process of multiple iterations by its engineering nature; 2) in engineering of systems that include control loops, it is important that a control engineer be able to rapidly, but approximately, assess and predict the consequences of decisions in the system design and, consequently, make judicious modifications and revisions on the design. The purpose of this Special Issue, therefore, is to facilitate the understanding, and provide benchmarks and guidelines useful for this process. We are primarily interested in obtaining rapid, controller-independent limits on the achievable feedback control performance, and understanding the tradeoffs between various control attributes such as disturbance rejection, transient response, robustness, and noise reduction. The area of performance limitations has a highly developed theory for the case of linear-time invariant feedback systems,	feedback	Jie Chen;Richard H. Middleton	2003	IEEE Trans. Automat.

The thermoelectric module (TEM)-based system is part of a microfluidic platform for genetic basis of disease diagnosis. Multistage TEMs with individualized control are used to improve the response speeds compared to a single TEM. Currently, there exists neither a mathematical representation to predict the TEMs' response, nor any standardized approach to identify such systems-both of which will greatly assist in effectively controlling the temperature of the TEMs. Hence, we propose here an approach for system identification of these nonlinear elements in a cascade configuration. In this customized TEM configuration, a linear multiple-input-multi-output (MIMO) structure with temperature difference variables as the system outputs is chosen to derive the system model for subsequent controller design. For the application of temperature cycling between different set-points, a group of model-based controllers with switching strategy is designed, and for each set-point region, an internal model-based decentralized controller is implemented. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the switching controller exhibits superior control performance for fast tracking (~ 6°C/s slew rate) and low steady state error (±0.1°C) when compared to a non-switching controller. The controller design approach can easily be extended to further multi-channel modules for wider applicability. Here, the integration of cost-effective and thermally-efficient physical temperature control elements with a switching and decentralized controller is applied to viral detection, which serves as the validation of the system identification-based controller.	control system;mimo;multistage amplifier;nonlinear system;simulation;steady state;system identification;temperature cycling	Govind V.

Instead of following the many existing results that solve the problem by using probabilistic approaches based on the probabilities of the uncertainties occurring between the sensor and the filter, we propose a non-probabilistic approach by time-stamping the measurement packets. Both single-measurement and multiple measurement packets are studied. We also consider the case of burst arrivals, where more than one packet may arrive between the receiver's previous and current sampling times; the scenario where the control input is non-zero and subject to delays and packet dropouts is examined as well. It is shown that, in such a situation, the optimal state estimate would generally be dependent on the possible control input. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the various proposed filters.	control system;network packet	Maryam Moayedi;Yung Kuan Foo;Yeng Chai Soh	2011	Int. J.

A series of Lipschitz domains are constructed recursively, each of which contains two Lipschitz switching surfaces that may be non-smooth. Filippov's differential inclusion is adopted to describe the dynamics of the closed-loop system. Based on the constructed Lipschitz domains, a feedback controller is designed to drive the trajectories of the closed-loop system to the origin asymptotically. Finally, the validity of the method is illuminated by some numerical examples.	contingency (philosophy);convex cone	Xin Huo;Yu Yao;Kai Zheng	2011	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2011.042656	differential inclusion;variable structure control;mathematical optimization;nonlinear control;lipschitz domain;calculus;control theory;mathematics;lipschitz continuity	Arch	71.99206795154848	-3.829114072182178	194598

Given a Lyapunov-based continuous-time adaptive controller that ensures some stability properties for the closed-loop system, a sufficient condition for the design of high order discrete-time controllers is given. The stability analysis is carried out considering the truncated Fliess series of the Lyapunov difference equation. Due to the appearance of power terms of the unknown parameter, the problem is reparameterized in a convex-like form and an estimation law for the new unknown parameter is derived with no need of overparametrization or projection techniques. Then, assuming appropriate conditions hold, high order controllers can be designed. The boundedness of the extended state vector is ensured under some conditions, for a sufficiently small sampling period. It is shown how increasing the controller order can improve system performance.	data system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Romain Postoyan;Tarek Ahmed-Ali;Laurent Burlion;Françoise Lamnabhi-Lagarrigue	2008	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2007.12.007	parametrization;control engineering;sampled data systems;sampling;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;calculus;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign	Robotics	71.84546614796537	-3.7366674739616523	194963

A general physical model for a nominal linear quantum system coupled directly and indirectly to external systems is presented. Fundamental properties of stability, dissipation, passivity, and gain for this class of linear quantum models are presented and characterized using complex Lyapunov equations and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Coherent H∞ and LQG synthesis methods are extended to accommodate direct couplings using multistep optimization.

The use of the relay allows the tuning of the secondary loop to be done without necessarily placing the primary controller in manual mode. It also turns out that the relative speeds of the loops in cascade can be derived from the limit cycle oscillations obtained from relay feedback auto-tuning. >	disk controller;relay;self-tuning	Chang Chieh Hang;Ai Poh Loh;Vinod U.

In this article the analysis of spin-axis stabilisation of underactuated rigid spacecraft in the presence of sinusoidal disturbances is presented. By using the Euler-Poisson form to describe the equations of motion and assuming the disturbances in three axes are decoupled with known frequencies, the paper first studies the problem of the underactuated rigid axisymmetric spacecraft by applying the internal modal principle to eliminate the sinusoidal disturbance. Then the paper turns to the more complicated asymmetric spacecraft, where the boundedness of the angular velocity for the underactuated axis is analysed in detail. The paper also proves the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems for both axisymmetric spacecraft and asymmetric spacecraft by combining the Lyapunov direct method with the LaSalle's theorem. The simulation results show that the proposed control law is effective in the presence of sinusoidal disturbance.	apache axis;underactuation	H.-H. Zhang;F. Wang;Pavel Trivailo	2008	Int. J.

RONs are introduced to model a class of sectorlike nonlinearities that occur in a probabilistic way according to a Bernoulli distributed white sequence with a known conditional probability. The failures of sensors are quantified by a variable varying in a given interval. The time-varying delay is unknown with given lower and upper bounds. The aim of the addressed reliable H∞ filtering problem is to design a filter such that, for all possible sensor failures, RONs, time-delays as well as admissible parameter uncertainties, the filtering error dynamics is asymptotically mean-square stable and also achieves a prescribed H∞ performance level. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a filter are obtained by using a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and delay-partitioning technique. The filter gains are characterized in terms of the solution to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.	bernoulli polynomials;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;randomness;sensor	Yisha Liu;Zidong Wang;Wei David Wang	2011	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.07.018	computer simulation;calculus;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm;statistics	Robotics	74.3587548205283	-3.3950823349559167	196150

The physical plant and the dynamic controller are in continuous time, and a communication channel exists between the output of the physical plant and the input of the dynamic controller. Three important communication features are considered: measurement quantization, signal transmission delay, and data packet dropout, which appear typically in a networked environment. Attention is focused on the design of dynamic output-feedback controllers which ensure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems. Linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based conditions are formulated for the existence of admissible controllers. If these conditions are satisfied, a desired controller can be readily constructed. A satellite system is used to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed controller design method.	authorization;channel (communications);control system;control theory;controller (control theory);dropout (neural networks);game controller;linear matrix inequality;linear time-invariant theory;log management;network packet;physical plant;social inequality;time complexity;time-invariant system	Huijun Gao;Xiangyu Meng;Tongwen Chen;James Lam	2010	SIAM J.

This system enables the engine controller to tailor the valve event according to the engine operating condition in real-time to improve fuel economy, emissions, and torque output performance. This paper presents the transient control of a laboratory electro-hydraulic fully flexible valve actuation system. Transient control of the FFVA system includes lift transient, duration transient, phase transient, speed transient, and mode transient. With constant engine speed, the valve profile is periodic in time domain and the lift, phase, and duration transients can be realized using robust repetitive control. When the engine speed varies, the period of the valve profile changes in real-time. This phenomenon poses a fundamental challenge to the transient control problem and repetitive control cannot be applied anymore. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new valve profile consisting of a periodic portion and a dwell portion with time-varying duration. Robust repetitive control is then applied to the periodic portion and proportional plus integral and derivative (PID) control is applied to the dwell portion. These two controls are switched in real-time to achieve asymptotic valve profile tracking performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, we show real-time valve-lift profiles used to explore homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion at different engine operating conditions.	flexible-fuel vehicle;pid;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription	Zongxuan Sun;Tang-Wei Kuo	2010	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2009.2025188	control engineering;engine control unit;electronic engineering;valve actuator;engineering;control system;control theory;actuator	Embedded	72.48046921231875	-9.838584296769584	198290
