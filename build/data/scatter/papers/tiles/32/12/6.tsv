701f81329a25e380ca472b98e93a258ab4bb0d6c	hidden markov model for term weighting in verbose queries	hidden markov model;term weighting;verbose query	It has been observed that short queries generally have better performance than their corresponding long versions when retrieved by the same IR model. This is mainly because most of the current models do not distinguish the importance of different terms in the query. Observed that sentence-like queries encode information related to the term importance in the grammatical structure, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based method to extract such information to do term weighting. The basic idea of choosing HMM is motivated by its successful application in capturing the relationship between adjacent terms in NLP field. Since we are dealing with queries of natural language form, we think that HMM can also be used to capture the dependence between the weights and the grammatical structures. Our experiments show that our assumption is quite reasonable and that such information, when utilized properly, can greatly improve retrieval performance.	hidden markov model;markov chain	Xueliang Yan;Guanglai Gao;Xiangdong Su;Hongxi Wei;Xueliang Zhang;Qianqian Lu	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33247-0_10	computer science;machine learning;hidden semi-markov model;pattern recognition;data mining;information retrieval;hidden markov model	NLP	-33.10085038784751	-61.67473717275055	148795

We show that: (1) topic models are effective for document smoothing; (2) more elaborate topic models that capture topic dependencies provide no additional gains; (3) smoothing documents by using their similar documents is as effective as smoothing them by using topic models; (4) topics discovered on the whole corpus are too coarse-grained to be useful for query expansion. Experiments to measure topic models' ability to predict held-out likelihood confirm past results on small corpora, but suggest that simple approaches to topic model are better for large corpora.	experiment;information retrieval;query expansion;smoothing;text corpus;topic model	Xing Yi;James Allan	2008		10.1145/1458082.1458317	natural language processing;query expansion;document clustering;computer science;evaluation;machine learning;data mining;topic model;information retrieval	ML	-27.874859910399067	-61.89146862360252	148799
f14f26a5ce9ed09630c2d0d2fbeda1594ab36ac7	a cross-domain recommender system based on common-sense knowledge bases		A system able to extract and recommend technical terms from various domains is proposed in this paper. The motivation is to provide keywords that users may not be familiar with in the beginning but will be interested in after studying. To acquire domain knowledge, we collect documents from various sources, and the words in the documents are then represented as semantic word vectors. Given queries from users, the system first extracts important terms from given documents and computes the semantic similarity between those terms. Next, we utilize third party common-sense knowledge bases such as ConceptNet and Wikipedia to connect the queries to those extracted keywords through the network structures. Finally, the system will collect all keywords traversed and recommend the top-n of them. We propose and compare four models for the recommendation, and the differences between using ConceptNet and Wikipedia for discovering related knowledge are also investigated in this work.	in the beginning... was the command line;open mind common sense;recommender system;semantic similarity;wikipedia;word embedding	Yi-Ting Tsai;Chih-Shiang Wu;Hsiang-Ling Hsu;Tenniel Liu;Pei-Lin Chen;Wen-Hao Chen;Keng-Te Liao	2017	2017 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI)	10.1109/TAAI.2017.48	recommender system;domain knowledge;information extraction;information retrieval;semantic similarity;commonsense knowledge;computer science	Web+IR	-28.403418306034823	-63.420804752738455	149795
719dee5116371668b2e60e70c93ff3aba7372b42	a visual approach for interactive keyterm-based clustering		The keyterm-based approach is arguably intuitive for users to direct text-clustering processes and adapt results to various applications in text analysis. Its way of markedly influencing the results, for instance, by expressing important terms in relevance order, requires little knowledge of the algorithm and has predictable effect, speeding up the task. This article first presents a text-clustering algorithm that can easily be extended into an interactive algorithm. We evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in unsupervised mode. Next, we propose three interactive versions of the algorithm based on keyterm labeling, document labeling, and hybrid labeling. We then demonstrate that keyterm labeling is more effective than document labeling in text clustering. Finally, we propose a visual approach to support the keyterm-based version of the algorithm. Visualizations are provided for the whole collection as well as for detailed views of document and cluster relationships. We show the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework, Vis-Kt, by presenting typical clustering cases on real text document collections. A user study is also reported that reveals overwhelmingly positive acceptance toward keyterm-based clustering.	algorithm;cluster analysis;preprocessor;relevance;sequence labeling;text corpus;usability testing;user-centered design;wikipedia	Seyednaser Nourashrafeddin;Ehsan Sherkat;Rosane Minghim;Evangelos E.

In addition, blind relevance feedback was applied in the search process. As in 2005, the experiments wer e carried out with a language independent indexing strategy. We experimented with HTML title, H1 element and other elements emphasizing text. Our index containe d title and H1, emphasized elements, full and partial content. Blind relevance fe dback was implemented for all index fields except for the full content. The best results with the WebCLEF 2005 topics were achieved with a strong weight on the ti tl -element accomplishing a marginal improvement over the best post submission ru s for the mixedmonolingual task at WebCLEF 2005. For the WebCLEF 2 006 topics, improved results were achieved with the manually generated t opics, while those automatically generated led to results far below average. The bes t performance for manual topics for CLEF 2006 was achieved with a strong weight on b th HTML title as well as H1 elements, and a decreased weight for the other elem ents.

Inspired by the PageRank and HITS (hubs and authorities) algorithms for Web search, we propose a structural reranking approach to ad-hoc retrieval that applies to settings with no hyperlink information. We reorder the documents in an initially retrieved set by exploiting implicit asymmetric relationships among them. We consider  generation links , which indicate that the language model induced from one document assigns high probability to the text of another. We study a number of reranking criteria based on measures of centrality in the graphs formed by generation links, and show that integrating centrality into standard language-model-based retrieval is quite effective at improving precision at top ranks; the best resultant performance is comparable, and often superior, to that of a state-of-the-art pseudo-feedback-based retrieval approach. In addition, we demonstrate the merits of our language-model-based method for inducing interdocument links by comparing it to previously suggested notions of interdocument similarities (e.g., cosines within the vector-space model).We also show that ourmethods for inducing centrality are substantially more effective than approaches based on document-specific characteristics, several of which are novel to this study.	hyperlink;language model;pagerank	Oren Kurland;Lillian Lee	2010	ACM Trans.

936147515ebeded721e8d725b8ee5dc7a87298ba	abstractive text summarization based on improved semantic graph approach		The goal of abstractive summarization of multi-documents is to automatically produce a condensed version of the document text and maintain the significant information. Most of the graph-based extractive methods represent sentence as bag of words and utilize content similarity measure, which might fail to detect semantically equivalent redundant sentences. On other hand, graph based abstractive method depends on domain expert to build a semantic graph from manually created ontology, which requires time and effort. This work presents a semantic graph approach with improved ranking algorithm for abstractive summarization of multi-documents. The semantic graph is built from the source documents in a manner that the graph nodes denote the predicate argument structures (PASs)‚Äîthe semantic structure of sentence, which is automatically identified by using semantic role labeling; while graph edges represent similarity weight, which is computed from PASs semantic similarity. In order to reflect the impact of both document and document set on PASs, the edge of semantic graph is further augmented with PAS-to-document and PAS-to-document set relationships. The important graph nodes (PASs) are ranked using the improved graph ranking algorithm. The redundant PASs are reduced by using maximal marginal relevance for re-ranking the PASs and finally summary sentences are generated from the top ranked PASs using language generation. Experiment of this research is accomplished using DUC-2002, a standard dataset for document summarization. Experimental findings signify that the proposed approach shows superior performance than other summarization approaches.	algorithm;automatic summarization;bag-of-words model;crc-based framing;computer science;formal concept analysis;marginal model;master of science in information technology;maximal set;natural language generation;relevance;semantic role labeling;semantic similarity;sensor;similarity measure;subject-matter expert;taxonomy (general);text corpus	Atif Khan;Naomie Salim;Haleem Farman;Murad Khan;Bilal Jan;Awais Ahmad;Imran Ahmed;Anand Paul	2018	International Journal of Parallel Programming	10.1007/s10766-018-0560-3	semantic similarity;theoretical computer science;automatic summarization;semantic equivalence;semantic role labeling;similarity measure;bag-of-words model;computer science;artificial intelligence;sentence;pattern recognition;ranking	NLP	-26.903707179910977	-64.7861135959025	152162

This technique also includes the geographic expansion of the topics. Moreover, several experiments related to the use of keywords and hyponyms in the filtering process are performed. We also use a new approach in the re-ranking process based on the original position of each document in the ranking. The results obtained show that our query reformulation sometimes retrieves valid documents that the default query is not able to find, but on average it does not improve the baseline case. The best result is obtained considering the geographic entities in the traditional retrieval process.	geographic information system;information retrieval	Jos√© Manuel Perea Ortega;Luis Alfonso Ure√±a L√≥pez;Manuel Garc√≠a Vega;Miguel √Ångel Garc√≠a Cumbreras	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-04447-2_112	query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;ranking;computer science;data mining;database;web search query;information retrieval;query language	Web+IR	-30.561432251239076	-59.99620978225681	152380

f971bf00097e90e71dce51c65fc266504dece86a	expertise drift and query expansion in expert search	pseudo relevance feedback;information retrieval;expert finding;topic drift;query expansion;expertise modelling;expert search information retrieval	Pseudo-relevance feedback, or query expansion, has been shown to improve retrieval performance in the adhoc retrieval task. In such a scenario, a few top-ranked documents are assumed to be relevant, and these are then used to expand and refine the initial user query, such that it retrieves a higher quality ranking of documents. However, there has been little work in applying query expansion in the expert search task. In this setting, query expansion is applied by assuming a few top-ranked candidates have relevant expertise, and using these to expand the query. Nevertheless, retrieval is not improved as expected using such an approach. We show that the success of the application of query expansion is hindered by the presence of topic drift within the profiles of experts that the system considers. In this work, we demonstrate how topic drift occurs in the expert profiles, and moreover, we propose three measures to predict the amount of drift occurring in an expert's profile. Finally, we suggest and evaluate ways of enhancing query expansion in expert search using our new insights. Our results show that, once topic drift has been anticipated, query expansion can be successfully applied in a general manner in the expert search task.	baseline (configuration management);cohesion (computer science);it baseline protection;norm (social);query expansion;relevance feedback;web search engine	Craig MacDonald;Iadh Ounis	2007		10.1145/1321440.1321490	sargable;query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;ranking;computer science;machine learning;concept search;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval;query language	NLP	-29.948202129013026	-59.424285956961604	152750

30b0d994990dffdf82c56e9428f0e83e001d3fd3	a study into annotation ranking metrics in community contributed image corpora		Community contributed datasets are becoming increasing common in automated image annotation systems. One important issue with community image data is that there is no guarantee that the associated metadata is relevant. A method is required that can accurately rank the semantic relevance of community annotations. This should enable the extracting of relevant subsets from potentially noisy collections of these annotations. Having relevant, non-heterogeneous tags assigned to images should improve community image retrieval systems, such as Flickr, which are based on text retrieval methods. In the literature, the current state of the art approach to ranking the semantic relevance of Flickr tags is based on the widely used tf-idf metric. In the case of datasets containing landmark images, however, this metric is inefficient and can be improved upon. In this paper, we present a landmark recognition framework, that provides end-to-end automated recognition and annotation. In our study into automated annotation, we evaluate 5 alternate approaches to tf-idf to rank tag relevance in community contributed landmark image corpora. We carry out a thorough evaluation of each of these ranking metrics and results of this evaluation demonstrate that four of these proposed techniques outperform the current commonly-used tf-idf approach for this task. Our best performing evaluated approach achieves a significant F-Measure increase of .19 over tf-idf.	text corpus	Mark Hughes;Gareth J. F. Jones;Noel E.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach of semantic representation and statistical measurements. Document is divided into content segments first. By Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), their semantic links with standard concept identifiers are built up whose weights are calculated statistically. In this way, effective concept fusing and document classification can be achieved. In addition, a semantic overlay for specific documents will be constructed via concept fusing.

These NLP graphs can be measured with Precision and Recall against a ground truth graph representing what the documents actually say. When asking conjunctive queries on NLP graphs, the Recall of the query is expected to be roughly the product of the Recall of the relations in each conjunct. Since Recall is typically less than one, conjunctive query Recall on NLP graphs degrades geometrically with the number of conjuncts. We present an approach to address this Recall problem by hypothesizing links in the graph that would improve query Recall, and then attempting to find more evidence to support them. Using this approach, we confirm that in the context of answering queries over NLP graphs, we can use lower confidence results from NLP components if they complete a query result.	conjunctive query;end-to-end principle;entity;ground truth;information needs;knowledge representation and reasoning;natural language processing;precision and recall;resource description framework	Christopher A.

Synonymy and Ambiguity are among the biggest challenges in identifying such entities. Both challenges are addressed by Entity Linking, the task of grounding entity mentions in textual documents to Knowledge Base entries. Entity Linking has been based in the use of single cross-domain Knowledge Bases as source for entities. This PhD research proposes the use of multiple Knowledge Bases for Entity Linking as a way to increase the number of entities recognized in text. The problem of Entity Linking with Multiple Knowledge Bases is addressed by using textual and Knowledge Base features as contexts for Entity Linking, Ontology Modularization to select the most relevant subset of entity entries, and Collective Inference to decide the most suitable entity entry to link with each mention.

In this study, each retrieval strategy represents both queries and documents using the same set of single terms; however they weight them differently. To combine these search schemes, we do not apply a given combination operator on the retrieval status nor the rank of each retrieved record (e.g., sum, average, max., etc.). We think that each retrieval strategy may perform well for a set of queries and poorly for other requests. Thus, based on a given query's statistical characteristics, our search model first selects the more appropriate retrieval scheme and then retrieves information based on the selected search mechanism. Since the selection procedure is done before any search operation, our approach has the advantage of limiting the search time to one retrieval algorithm instead of retrieving items using various retrieval schemes, and then combining the given results.	algorithm;document	Jacques Savoy;Melchior Ndarugendamwo;Dana Vrajitoru	1995				Web+IR	-33.03885335788256	-60.80306939515751	155030
e303909c5a618a07d3349763e5818114a3732743	a better approach to ontology integration using clustering through global similarity measure		Corresponding Author: Ashwin Makwana Department of Computer Engineering, Charotar University of Science and Technology, CHARUSAT Campus, Changa, Gujarat, India Email: ashwinmakwana.ce@charusat.ac.in Abstract: Knowledge representation is a crucial area of work in the intelligent system, especially in query answering system development. Ontology is used to represent shared knowledge of a particular domain for query answering system. Domain-specific ontology can be designed and developed by many groups and researchers, because of which there is heterogeneity in the knowledgebase. Ontology integration or merging is necessary in order to solve this problem of mixed knowledge. Finding similarity between two ontologies is crucial to achieve integration or merging of ontology. In this study, we present a method to generate a cluster of ontologies using global similarity measure of two ontologies. Ontology matching tools are used to find matched classes between two ontologies. Output of ontology matching tool is mapping between two ontologies and is used for generating clusters of ontology. We use Jaccard Similarity Index as a global similarity measure for clustering. Based on this measure, the popular k-means clustering algorithm is used to perform clustering of ontologies. Bins of ontologies are generated from each cluster. From each bin, all ontologies are finally merged into a single ontology, which helps us in reducing search effort in querying knowledge in query processing. The outcome of this research paper to provide better solution for merging ontology. Here, we use agriculture domain ontology corpus from the standard dataset for experimentation.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;cluster analysis;computer engineering;database;domain-specific language;email;jaccard index;k-means clustering;knowledge base;knowledge representation and reasoning;ontology (information science);ontology alignment;question answering;similarity measure;web ontology language	Ashwin Makwana;Amit Ganatra	2018	JCS	10.3844/jcssp.2018.854.867	artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;ontology;knowledge representation and reasoning;data mining;jaccard index;ontology alignment;ontology (information science);semantic web;similarity measure;cluster analysis	AI	-27.951696773479483	-60.31712525250227	155253
2dd6a7618f48d08ac16e1df637ea40b83beee236	a comparison of methods for web document classification	web documents	WebDoc is an automated classification system that assigns Web documents to appropriate Library of Congress subject headings based upon the text in the documents. We have used different classification methods in different versions of WebDoc. One classification method is a statistical approach that counts the number of occurrences of a given noun phrase in documents assigned to a particular subject heading as the basis for determining the weights to be assigned to the candidate indexes. The second classification method uses a na√Øve Bayes approach. In this case, we experimented with the use of smoothing to dampen the effect of having a large number of 0s in our feature vectors. The third classification method is a k-nearest neighbors approach. With this approach, we tested two different ways of determining the similarity of feature vectors. In this paper, we report the performance of each of the versions of WebDoc in terms of recall, precision, and F-measures.	course (navigation);document classification;feature vector;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;library of congress subject headings;naive bayes classifier;smoothing	Julia E.

f37b2a313ee2b3380e82917db663debc851fe53b	applying two-level reinforcement ranking in query-oriented multidocument summarization	summarization;ranking;weighting	Sentence ranking is the issue of most concern in document summarization today. While traditional featurebased approaches evaluate sentence significance and rank the sentences relying on the features that are particularly designed to characterize the different aspects of the individual sentences, the newly emerging graphbased ranking algorithms (such as the PageRank-like algorithms) recursively compute sentence significance using the global information in a text graph that links sentences together. In general, the existing PageRank-like algorithms can model well the phenomena that a sentence is important if it is linked by many other important sentences. Or they are capable of modeling the mutual reinforcement among the sentences in the text graph. However, when dealing with multidocument summarization these algorithms often assemble a set of documents into one large file. The document dimension is totally ignored. In this article we present a framework to model the two-level mutual reinforcement among sentences as well as documents. Under this framework we design and develop a novel ranking algorithm such that the document reinforcement is taken into account in the process of sentence ranking.The convergence issue is examined. We also explore an interesting and important property of the proposed algorithm.When evaluated on the DUC 2005 and 2006 query-oriented multidocument summarization datasets, significant results are achieved.	algorithm;automatic summarization;pagerank;recursion;reinforcement learning;text graph;upsampling	Furu Wei;Wenjie Li;Qin Lu;Yanxiang He	2009	JASIST	10.1002/asi.21127	natural language processing;ranking;computer science;automatic summarization;data mining;weighting;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-26.55345175792973	-62.85681970224851	155545

Graph-structures are obtained from textual documents by making use of the well-known Part-OfSpeech (POS) tagging technique. More specifically, a simple rule-based (re)classifier is used to map each tag onto graph vertices and edges. As a result, a decomposition of textual documents is obtained where tokens are automatically parsed and attached to either a vertex or an edge. It is shown how textual documents can be aggregated through their graph-structures and finally, it is shown how vertex-ranking methods can be used to find relevant tokens.1.	automatic summarization;baseline (configuration management);cycle rank;graph operations;logic programming;parsing;part-of-speech tagging;rule-based system;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory);whole earth 'lectronic link	Antoon Bronselaer;Gabriella Pasi	2013		10.2991/eusflat.2013.96	natural language processing;text graph;computer science;data mining;information retrieval	NLP	-26.749314071454343	-64.57905276930691	155786

The system consists of three steps: tweet analysis, passage retrieval and summarization. For each tweet, key phrases are first extracted by making use of ArkTweet toolkit and employing several heuristics. They are then submitted as queries to Indri search engine to retrieve relevant passages. Finally, a multi-document summarization system (MEAD) is used to generate the output document with a limit of 500 words. The preliminary results show that the approach does not work well where our run was ranked 22nd out of 24 runs. We discuss our observations for these results and some further possible improvements.	automatic summarization;heuristic (computer science);multi-document summarization;web search engine	Khaled Hossain Ansary;Anh Tuan Tran;Nam Khanh Tran	2013			information retrieval;automatic summarization;contextualization;heuristics;search engine;ranking;computer science	AI	-31.383136839840223	-62.916651792207624	156257
2040c8ce2eda6a2e05bbe4a6cbda6cf0b10010e4	using minimaps to enable toponym resolution with an effective 100% rate of recall	minimap;precision;recall;toponym resolution;geotagging	A number of systems have been recently constructed that make use of a map query interface to access documents by the locations that they mention. These mentions are often ambiguous in the sense that many interpretations exist for the locations which are not always expressed along with all the necessary qualifiers. In other words, users are assumed to be able to make the appropriate identification based either on knowledge of prior queries or the nature of the document containing the references as well as knowledge of the target audience. The disambiguation process is known as toponym resolution. The map query interface results in the placement of icons and links to the appropriate documents at the corresponding location on the map. Assuming that all toponyms have been recognized (i.e., 100% rate of recall for toponym recognition), it is shown how to achieve an effective 100% rate of recall for toponym resolution for all interpretations of a toponym that the toponym recognition process associates with at least one document. This is done with the aid of a minimap that shows all of these interpretations which means that a user has access to all documents that mention a specific location as long as the textual specification to the location has been recognized as a location rather than as the name of another entity such as a person, company, organization, etc. It also assumes that the user is capable of determining the correct interpretation of each toponym. This is important as it enables the determination of precision and recall.	document;precision and recall;toponym resolution;word-sense disambiguation	Hanan Samet	2014		10.1145/2675354.2675698	computer science;data mining;recall;accuracy and precision;geotagging;world wide web;information retrieval;statistics	Web+IR	-30.450677257587916	-60.271862206267144	156737

Methods for MLIR are categorized as: (1) Fusion-based methods that merge results from multiple retrieval runs, and (2) Direct methods that build a unique index for the entire collection. Merging results of individual runs reduces the overall effectiveness, while more effective direct methods suffer from either time complexity and memory overhead, or over-weighting of index terms. In this paper, we propose a direct MLIR approach by using the language modeling framework that includes a novel multilingual language model estimation for documents, and a new way to globally estimate word statistics. These contributions enable ranking documents in multiple languages in one retrieval phase without having the problems of the previous direct methods. Moreover, our approach has the advantage of accommodating multilingual feedback information which helps to prevent query drift, and consequently to improve the performance. Finally, we effectively address the common case of incomplete coverage of translation resources in our proposed estimation methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous MLIR approaches.	categorization;dictionary;feedback;ietf language tag;information retrieval;kullback‚Äìleibler divergence;language model;n-gram;overhead (computing);query language;time complexity	Razieh Rahimi;Azadeh Shakery;Irwin King	2015	Information Retrieval Journal	10.1007/s10791-015-9255-1	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-28.784722934543172	-61.62640627193998	157128
de91671e6798535cb0e6c795ff41f28c87877601	entity-based keyword search in web documents		In document search, documents are typically seen as a flat list of keywords. To deal with the syntactic interoperability, i.e., the use of different keywords to refer to the same real world entity, entity linkage has been used to replace keywords in the text with a unique identifier of the entity to which they are referring. Yet, the flat list of entities fails to capture the actual relationships that exist among the entities, information that is significant for a more effective document search. In this work we propose to go one step further from entity linkage in text, and model the documents as a set of structures that describe relationships among the entities mentioned in the text. We show that this kind of representation is significantly improving the effectiveness of document search. We describe the details of the implementation of the above idea and we present an extensive set of experimental results that prove our point.	entity;experiment;identifier;interoperability;linkage (software);response time (technology);unique key;web page;web search engine	Enrico Sartori;Yannis Velegrakis;Francesco Guerra	2016	Trans.

1473d0459efd26cfee35b02a07efd35adf76532d	a novel view on information content of concepts in a large ontology and a view on the structure and the quality of the ontology	information content;semantic distance	Semantic distance and semantic similarity are two important information retrieval measures used in word sense disambiguation as well as for the assessment of how relevant concepts are with respect to the documents in which they are found. A variety of calculation methods have been proposed in the literature, whereby methods taking into account the information content of an individual concept outperform those that do not. In this paper, we present a novel recursive approach to calculate a concept's information content based on the information content of the concepts to which it relates. The method is applicable to extremely large ontologies containing several million concepts and relationships amongst them. It is shown that a concept's information content as calculated by this method provides additional information with respect to an ontology that cannot be approximated by hierarchical edge-counting or human insight. In addition, it is suggested that the method can be used for quality control within large ontologies and that it can give you an impression on the structure and the quality of the ontology.	approximation algorithm;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;information retrieval;ontology (information science);population parameter;recursion;self-information;semantic similarity;word sense;word-sense disambiguation;fetal tachycardia	Carl Van Buggenhout;Werner Ceusters	2005	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.03.009	upper ontology;semantic similarity;self-information;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;data mining;information quality;ontology-based data integration;information retrieval;process ontology;dishin	Web+IR	-31.936869563122254	-60.33565067876389	158164
120217addea70a9a203dbb8b94ac95b1a7e6fa44	explicit scientific knowledge comparison based on semantic description matching	semantic description;scientific knowledge	Researchers begin new research by acquiring pre-existing explicit scientific knowledge that is potentially relevant to the research subject. In order to find some potentially relevant explicit scientific knowledge items, such as knowledge whose content is similar to the targeted research, a researcher must examine the semantics of each item. In this paper, after reviewing related work, an automated semantic description matching-based approach is presented for comparing items of explicit scientific knowledge. This approach obtains a matching score between semantic descriptions of two items of explicit scientific knowledge that indicates their similarity. Three dimensions are considered in this approach: matching granularity, similarity scale for instance classes, and logic similarity scale. In order to match two semantic descriptions, a six-step method is presented: creation of atomic queries, generalization of query classes, generalization of query properties, addition of rules, creation of instances implied by complex class definition, and semi-automatic pruning of matching results. Finally, some conclusions regarding the approach are presented together with plans for future work.	query language;semiconductor industry	Weisen Guo;Steven B.

de144dbce1cfdb0ab480d3cdc88c4f67eb473d13	reference metadata extraction from korean research papers		A large amount of research papers are published in various fields and the ability to accurately extract metadata from a list of references is becoming increasingly important. Moreover, metadata extraction is crucial for measuring the influence of a particular study or researcher. However, it is difficult to automatically extract data from most lists of references because they consist of unstructured strings with bibliographies structured in various formats depending on the proceedings. Thus, this paper presents an effective and accurate method for extracting metadata, such as author name, title, publication year, volume, issue, page numbers, and journal name from heterogeneous references using the conditional random fields model. To conduct an experiment measuring the effectiveness of the proposed model, 1,415 references from 93 different academic papers published in Korea were used and a high accuracy of 97.10% was obtained.

We provide a progressive search approach towards problems with positive and negative tendencies aiming at improving the credibility of resources through multi times progressive searching. Meanwhile, we introduce Knowledge Graph as a resource process architecture to organize resources on the network and analyze the tendency of searchers for retrieving information by semantic analysis. We calculate entropy of resources according to searching times and amount of items of each search to represent the reliability of resources with positive and negative tendencies. Resources with ambiguous tendency and false information will be eliminated during the process of progressive search and quality of searching results will be improved while avoiding dead loop of searching towards infinite and complex problems. We apply the searching strategy to a medical resource processing system that provides high precision medical resource retrieval service for medical workers to verify the feasibility of our approach.

a19394edf53d4c19a5facd56aaa2cc3050a35c0f	phrasal graph-based method for abstractive vietnamese paragraph compression		Text compression is the task of identifying the main information in the source text to form a short single sentence. A broad approach is to find a path containing common vertices in the word graph model. The first issue of this approach is that the path finding algorithm can separate words from the phrase expressing a content. This leads to create new sentences having different meaning from the original ones. The second issue is that when an information is expressed by different words or phrases, called co-reference situations. Due to lacking of mechanism for handling this situation, the compression will be missing information. We propose in this paper a method to overcome the above issues. The core of new method is the improved graph model in which each vertex illustrates a phrase with its corresponding Part-of-Speech label. The intersection vertices of branches are results of mechanism for handling co-references. The compressing algorithm reduces the graph and forms the final sentence. We use ROUGE measure to compare with two word graph-based baselines. The experiment result shows that our method creates short sentences containing rich information.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);pathfinding;vertex (geometry)	Dang Tuan Nguyen;Trung Tran	2017		10.1145/3155133.3155177	vietnamese;source text;paragraph;rouge;vertex (geometry);compression (physics);mathematics;phrase;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;sentence	NLP	-27.07179636674512	-65.89817890492532	164761

We have used two Information Retrieval systems in our experiments: SMART and Terrier, with two query expansion techniques: one based on a thesaurus and the second one based on blind relevant feedback. We proposed two novel data fusion methods for merging the results of several models (retrieval schemes available in SMART and Terrier). Our experiments showed that the combination of query expansion methods and data fusion methods helps to improve the retrieval performance. We also present cross-language experiments, where the queries are automatically translated by combining the results of several online machine translation tools. Experiments on indexing the manual summaries and keywords gave the best retrieval results.	computer law & security review;experiment;information retrieval;machine translation;query expansion;smart;thesaurus	Muath Alzghool;Diana Inkpen	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-85760-0_88	natural language processing;query expansion;computer science;data mining;sensor fusion;machine translation;world wide web;information retrieval;human‚Äìcomputer information retrieval	Web+IR	-32.456973671812584	-63.395102830890885	165910

The second filtering stage is empow- ered by a semantically rich pattern taxonomy mining model which effectively fetches incoming documents according to the specific information needs of a user, thereby addressing the mismatch problem. The experiments have been conducted to compare the proposed two-stage filtering (T-SM) model with other possible """"term-based + pattern-based"""" or """"term-based + term-based"""" IF models.

Current approaches to achieve this suffer in quality, but we argue their performances might be improved by setting the focus on the structure in the data. Building upon research for concept disambiguation and linking to DBpedia, we are taking a novel approach to topic labelling by making use of structured data exposed by DBpedia. We start from the hypothesis that words co-occuring in text likely refer to concepts that belong closely together in the DBpedia graph. Using graph centrality measures, we show that we are able to identify the concepts that best represent the topics. We comparatively evaluate our graph-based approach and the standard text-based approach, on topics extracted from three corpora, based on results gathered in a crowd-sourcing experiment. Our research shows that graph-based analysis of DBpedia can achieve better results for topic labelling in terms of both precision and topic coverage.	centrality;crowdsourcing;dbpedia;linkage (software);performance;text corpus;text-based (computing);web search engine;word-sense disambiguation	Ioana Hulpus;Conor Hayes;Marcel Karnstedt;Derek Greene	2013		10.1145/2433396.2433454	latent dirichlet allocation;natural language processing;computer science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	NLP	-27.119838000828988	-64.83847336371446	166837

A user instantiated example consists of labels as criteria for decision making on purchasing a target product or service and instances related to the labels. When information extraction method outputs the information in table form, labels are used as column heading of table and instances are used as instances filled in the table. Because there are various labels and information that does not correspond to the target on the web site, it is difficult to extract the target information related to the target. Information of the target tends to be written in a similar string to the instances that is called """"similar entity"""". And target information is written close to the labels. So, the proposed method extracts information using the number of words among a user instantiated label and similar entities. Additionally, in order to extract a piece of information described across the web sites, the proposed method extracts information from linked web sites that are similar to the web site used for a user instantiated example. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extract information at recall rate of 65% and precision rate of 91%."""	course (navigation);entity;information extraction;purchasing;sensitivity and specificity	Daisuke Nakajima;Yuki Mitsui;Masaki Samejima;Masanori Akiyoshi	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops	10.1109/ICDMW.2011.29	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information extraction;information retrieval	DB	-30.404570927210354	-60.16690619826236	166843

The keyphrases are extracted from the retrieved documents and weighted with an algorithm based on information gain and co-occurrence of phrases. The selected keyphrases are translated into Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based on the POS phrase categorization technique for better query refomulation. Furthermore, we study whether ontologies such as WordNet and MeSH improve the retrieval performance in conjunction with the keyphrases. We test our techniques on TREC 5, 6, and 7 as well as a MEDLINE collection. The experimental results show that the use of keyphrases with POS phrase categorization produces the best average precision.	algorithm;categorization;digital library;disjunctive normal form;information gain in decision trees;information retrieval;kullback‚Äìleibler divergence;library (computing);medline;ontology (information science);query expansion;relevance feedback;text retrieval conference;wordnet	Min Song;Il-Yeol Song;Robert B.

8ae0bffe6c49273bd3b29ce68c5096be272ef5b1	clueweb09 and trec diversity		The TREC Web Track explores and evaluates Web retrieval technologies. The TREC 2009 Web Track included both a traditional adhoc retrieval task and a new diversity task. The goal of this diversity task is to return a ranked list of pages that together provide complete coverage for a query, while avoiding excessive redundancy in the result list. Both tasks will continue at TREC 2010, which will also include a new Web spam task. The track uses the ClueWeb09 dataset as its document collection. This collection consists of roughly 1 billion web pages in multiple languages, comprising approximately 25TB of uncompressed data crawled from the general Web during January and February 2009. For TREC 2009, topics for the track were created from the logs of a commercial search engine, with the aid of tools developed at Microsoft Research. Given a target query, these tools extracted and analyzed groups of related queries, using co-clicks and other information, to identify clusters of queries that highlight different aspects and interpretations of the target query. These clusters were employed by NIST for topic development. For use by the diversity task, each resulting topic is structured as a representative set of subtopics, each related to a different user need. Documents were judged with respect to the subtopics, as well as with respect to the topic as a whole. In 2009, a total of 18 groups submitted runs to the diversity task. To evaluate these runs, the task used two primary effectiveness measures: -nDCG as defined by Clarke et al. (SIGIR 2008) and an ‚Äúintent aware‚Äù version of precision, based on the work of Agrawal et al. (WSDM 2009). Developing and validating metrics for diversity tasks continues to be a goal of the track. For TREC 2010, we will report a number of additional evaluation measures that have been proposed over the past year, including an intent aware version of the ERR measure described by Chapelle et al. (CIKM 2009). Nick Craswell from Microsoft serves as the track co-coordinator. Ian Soboroff is the NIST contact. The ClueWeb09 collection was created through the efforts of Jamie Callan and Mark Hoy at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.

The Cranfield paradigm allows reproducible system evaluation by fostering the construction of standard and reusable benchmarks. Each benchmark or test collection comprises a set of queries, a collection of documents and a set of relevance judgements. Relevance judgements are often done by humans and thus expensive to obtain. Consequently, relevance judgements are customarily incomplete. Only a subset of the collection, the pool, is judged for relevance. In TREC-like campaigns, the pool is formed by the top retrieved documents supplied by systems participating in a certain evaluation task. With multiple retrieval systems contributing to the pool, an exploration/exploitation trade-off arises naturally. Exploiting effective systems could find more relevant documents, but exploring weaker systems might also be valuable for the overall judgement process. In this paper, we cast document judging as a multi-armed bandit problem. This formal modelling leads to theoretically grounded adjudication strategies that improve over the state of the art. We show that simple instantiations of multi-armed bandit models are superior to all previous adjudication strategies.	benchmark (computing);information retrieval;multi-armed bandit;programming paradigm;relevance;text retrieval conference	David E.

Knowledge of the spatial reader scope facilitates the construction of a news search engine that provides readers a set of news sources relevant to the location in which they are interested. In particular, it plays an important role in disambiguating toponyms (e.g., textual specifications of geographical locations) in news articles, as the process of selecting an interpretation for the toponym often reduces to one of selecting an interpretation that seems natural in the context of the spatial reader scope. The key to determining the spatial reader scope of news sources is the notion of local lexicon, which for a location s is a set of concepts such as, but not limited to, names of people, landmarks, and historical events, that are spatially related to s. Techniques to automatically generate the local lexicon of a location by using the link structure of Wikipedia are described and evaluated. A key contribution is the improvement of existing methods used in the semantic relatedness domain to extract concepts spatially related to a given location from the Wikipedia. Results of experiments are presented that indicate that the knowledge of the spatial reader scope significantly improves the disambiguation of textually specified locations in news articles and that using local lexicons is an effective method to determine the spatial reader scopes of news sources.	algorithm;effective method;experiment;geotagging;internet;lex (software);lexicon;location (geography);semantic similarity;text mining;web search engine;wikipedia;word-sense disambiguation	Gianluca Quercini;Hanan Samet;Jagan Sankaranarayanan;Michael D.

26d354f6408ecf495139dad7a0d7871ea930d201	a refined methodology for automatic keyphrase assignment to digital documents		AbstrAct: Keyphrases precisely express the primary topics and themes of documents and are valuable for cataloging and classification. Manually assigning keyphrases to existing documents is a tedious task; therefore, automatic keyphrase generation has been extensively used to classify digital documents. Existing automatic keyphrase generation algorithms are limited in assigning semantically relevant keyphrases to documents. In this paper we have proposed a methodology to refine the result set of automatically generated keyphrases by Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm (KEA++), so that the key-phrases accurately and precisely represent the content of the document. Our approach is an additional layer at the top of KEA++ and exploits semantic relationships and hierarchical structure of the controlled vocabulary to filter out irrelevant keyphrases from the result set generated by KEA++. The methodology was applied on different sets of academic publications for evaluation. Evaluation demonstrates that the proposed refinement methodology improves the quality of generated keyphrases.	algorithm;controlled vocabulary;refinement (computing);relevance;result set	Sharifullah Khan;Iram Fatima;Rabia Irfan;Khalid Latif	2011	JDIM		information retrieval;data mining;computer science	AI	-29.639310227884582	-65.81705058385398	168014
51b2afe664c24f5c520ebd500698863c197aac31	tldret: a temporal semantic facilitated linked data retrieval framework		Temporal features, such as date and time or time of an event, employ concise semantics for any kind of information retrieval, and therefore for linked data information retrieval. However, we have found that most linked data information retrieval techniques pay little attention on the power of temporal feature inclusion. We propose a keyword-based linked data information retrieval framework, called TLDRet, that can incorporate temporal features and give more concise results. Preliminary evaluation of our system shows promising performance.	data retrieval;linked data	Md-Mizanur Rahoman;Ryutaro Ichise	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-06826-8_18	relevance;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;data mining;database;term discrimination;information retrieval;human‚Äìcomputer information retrieval	Web+IR	-30.55072502678913	-59.29450732310532	168086

Therefore, detecting and eliminating nearly identical information is vital to enhance overall business decisions. To identify near-duplicates in large-scale text data, the shingling algorithm has been widely used. This algorithm is based on occurrences of contiguous subsequences of tokens in two or more sets of information, such as in documents. In other words, if there is a slight variation among documents, the overall performance of the algorithm decreases. Therefore, to increase the efficiency and accuracy performances of the shingling algorithm, we propose a hybrid approach that embeds Jaro distance and statistical results of word usage frequency for fixing the ill-defined data. In a real text dataset, the proposed hybrid approach improved the shingling algorithm's accuracy performance by 27% on average and achieved above 90% common shingles.	sensor	Cihan Varol;Sairam Hari	2015	J.

ec70bbb65f858642b11a9068e1e176c48d5a10d0	resolving polysemy and pseudonymity in entity linking with comprehensive name and context modeling	entity linking;polysemy;name modeling;pseudonymity;coreference;context modeling	Names are important atomic information carriers in unstructured text. Matching names that refer to the same entities is an important issue in text analysis and a key component in many real world applications. Generally referred to as entity linking, it is defined as a task that aligns a name mentioned in free text to its corresponding entry in a Knowledge Base (KB). The difficulty of the task lies in the many-to-many correspondence between names and entities, causing the pseudonymity and polysemy issues. Existing work usually focuses on resolving polysemy by aggregating large numbers of loosely arranged features in supervised learning frameworks, with very few targeting the pseudonymity or both issues with the same depth. In this work, we tackle both issues by comprehensive modeling of an enti-ty's name and context: we tackle the pseudonymity by modeling name variants on the query name and the KB title; and polysemy by modeling heterogeneous aspects of the query and KB context. Specially, we harness entity coreferences within query and KB documents together with the external alias resources for modeling name variants, and further use the name variants to identify focused context. Moreover, we propose a recall-boosted retrieval method for efficient candidate entity generation. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on the benchmark data. Names, such as person, organization and location names, are important atomic information carriers in unstructured text, such as newspaper articles. The referents that these names (or the rigid designators, as defined by Kripke [39]) stand for are called ''Named Entities'' in text processing research. On the other hand, the definitions and other detailed information about the entities are usually manually compiled and stored as entries in structured Knowledge Base (KB) such as dictionaries or encyclopedias. Entity linking is therefore a task that automatically aligns a name mentioned in unstructured text to its corresponding entry in a knowledge base. Entity linking has been found useful in many real-world applications. A direct application is in an educational environment where entity linking can provide fast access to reference knowledge in study materials such as lecture notes and assignments. In encyclopedia itself, a new knowledge entry's content can be cross-referenced to existing entries, so as to build comprehensive knowledge interlinking. Wikify [51] is a successful system toward the goal of enriching Wikipedia articles with interlinks.

In the case of textual data, decision support requires new tools, mainly textual aggregation functions, for better and faster high level analysis and decision making. Such tools will provide textual measures to users who wish to analyse documents online. In this paper, we propose a new aggregation function for textual data in an OLAP context based on the K-means method. This approach will highlight aggregates semantically richer than those provided by classical OLAP operators. The distance used in K-means is replaced by the Google similarity distance which takes into account the semantic similarity of keywords for their aggregation. The performance of our approach is analyzed and compared to other methods such as Topkeywords, TOPIC, TuBE and BienCube. The experimental study shows that our approach achieves better performances in terms of recall, precision,F-measure complexity and runtime.	aggregate function;algorithm;big data;decision support system;emoticon;experiment;f1 score;high-level programming language;k-means clustering;online analytical processing;performance;semantic similarity;text corpus	Mustapha Bouakkaz;Sabine Loudcher;Youcef Ouinten	2016	IJBIDM	10.1504/IJBIDM.2016.076425	online analytical processing;computer science;data mining;database;information retrieval	DB	-28.75881607323148	-60.35511509839176	168546

Our approach focuses on segment extraction and ranking using heuristic methods that assign weighted scores to segments of text. Also, we use a text categorization system and the Arabic WordNet to identify the thematic structure of the input text in order to select the most relevant sentences obtained from the statistical analysis process. We use a tokenizer, a stemmer and other statistical tools borrowed from traditional information retrieval to identify relevant segments in the text. The source document is segmented into its major units (title, paragraphs and lines) and then, text-lines are interpreted to extract relevant segments for inclusion in the summary. The summarization system was tested by 1200 human evaluators, who were each given a copy of a newspaper article and a system-generated summary and asked to classify them as ‚Äúrejected,‚Äù ‚Äùnot-related,‚Äù ‚Äúsatisfactory,‚Äù ‚Äúgood,‚Äù or ‚Äúaccepted.‚Äù 76.92% of the summaries were judged to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù and 92.34% were judged to be ‚Äúsatisfactory,‚Äù or ‚Äúgood,‚Äù or ‚Äúaccepted.‚Äù These results confirm the viability of using this hybrid approach to tackle the problem of Arabic text summarization.	automatic summarization;categorization;document classification;heuristic;information retrieval;lexical analysis;wordnet	Bassam H.

da055733130bd33eb5029501750ace084d4f7734	entailment graphs for text exploration		Taxonomy-based representations are widely used to model compactly large amounts of textual data. While current methods allow organizing knowledge at the lexical level (keywords/concepts/topics), there is an increasing demand to move towards more informative representations, which express properties of concepts and relations among them. This demand triggered our research on statement entailment graphs. In these graphs, nodes are natural language statements (propositions), comprising of predicates with their arguments and modifiers, while edges represent entailment relations between nodes. In this talk we report initial research that defines the properties of entailment graphs and their potential applications. Particularly, we show how entailment graphs can be profitably used for both knowledge acquisition and text exploration. Beyond providing a rich and informative representation, statement entailment graphs allow integrating multiple semantic inferences. So far, textual inference research focused on single, mutually independent, entailment judgments. However, in many scenarios there are dependencies among Text/Hypothesis pairs, which need to be captured consistently. This calls for global optimization algorithms for inter-dependent entailment judgments, taking advantage of the overall entailment graph structure (e.g. ensuring entailment graph transitivity). From the applied perspective, we are experimenting with entailment graphs in the context of the EXCITEMENT project industrial scenarios. We focus on the text analytics domain, and particularly on the analysis of customer interactions across multiple channels, including speech, email, chat and social media, and multiple languages (English, German, Italian). For example, we would like to recognize that the complaint they charge too much for sandwiches entails food is too expensive, and allow an analyst to compactly navigate through an entailment graph that consolidates the information structure of a large number of customer statements. Our eventual applied goal is to develop a new generation of inference-based text exploration applications, which will enable businesses to better analyze their diverse and often unpredicted client content. This task will be exemplified with data collected from real customer interactions, while referring to the EXCITEMENT Open Platform that we developed as a generic open source framework for textual inferences.	algorithm;email;evolutionary taxonomy;experiment;global optimization;information;interaction;knowledge acquisition;mathematical optimization;natural language;open platform;open-source software;organizing (structure);social media;text corpus;text mining;vertex-transitive graph	Ido Dagan;Bernardo Magnini	2013			combinatorics;logical consequence;mathematics;graph	NLP	-27.167769429559517	-61.05061967581549	170252

Authority is calculated based on the network properties of each topic network. ThemedPageRank, our combination of LDA-derived topics with PageRank differs from previous models in that topics influence both the bias and transition probabilities of PageRank. It also incorporates the age of documents. Our model is general in that it can be applied to all tasks which require an estimate of document‚Äìdocument, document‚Äì query, document‚Äìtopic and topic‚Äìquery similarities. We present two evaluations, one on the task of restoring the reference lists of 10,000 articles, the other on the task of automatically creating reading lists that mimic reading lists created by experts. In both evaluations, our system beats state-of-the-art, as well as Google Scholar and Google Search indexed againt the corpus.

51b5cecc3881f1608ce53c4229682f55e1787fa6	fast and space-efficient entity linking for queries	wikipedia;entity linking;web search;queries	Entity linking deals with identifying entities from a knowledge base in a given piece of text and has become a fundamental building block for web search engines, enabling numerous downstream improvements from better document ranking to enhanced search results pages. A key problem in the context of web search queries is that this process needs to run under severe time constraints as it has to be performed before any actual retrieval takes place, typically within milliseconds.  In this paper we propose a probabilistic model that leverages user-generated information on the web to link queries to entities in a knowledge base. There are three key ingredients that make the algorithm fast and space-efficient. First, the linking process ignores any dependencies between the different entity candidates, which allows for a O(k2) implementation in the number of query terms. Second, we leverage hashing and compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint. Finally, to equip the algorithm with contextual knowledge without sacrificing speed, we factor the distance between distributional semantics of the query words and entities into the model.  We show that our solution significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines by more than 14% while being able to process queries in sub-millisecond times---at least two orders of magnitude faster than existing systems.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);distributional semantics;downstream (software development);entity linking;knowledge base;memory footprint;ranking (information retrieval);statistical model;user-generated content;web search engine;web search query	Roi Blanco;Giuseppe Ottaviano;Edgar Meij	2015		10.1145/2684822.2685317	web query classification;computer science;machine learning;data mining;brand;entity linking;web search query;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-28.297567312799774	-62.76172513950142	171078

This paper further investigates the volatility of the ranking position, and a robust, adaptive model is developed with probability terms basing on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach. The parameters of HMM are trained by calculating the rank scores of each tuple in time series, and then this model is used to guide the ranking of OSs for further high accuracy depending on probability estimations. Preliminary Experimental evaluation on Microsoft Northwind and DBLP Databases are presented, which proves that HMM has superior discriminative properties.	dbl-browser;experiment;hidden markov model;markov chain;monte carlo method;operating system;programming paradigm;real-time clock;relational database;search algorithm;time series;volatility	Le Peng;Zhi Cai;Guowen Wu	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security	10.1109/CIS.2009.154	relational database;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;hidden markov model;statistics	DB	-28.561421314437318	-61.1879646182686	171170

In this paper, we discuss a framework of document description extension which utilizes domain knowledge and semantic similarity. Our idea is based on application of Tolerance Rough Set Model, semantic information extracted from source text and domain ontology to approximate concepts associated with documents and to enrich the vector representation. Some document representation models including document meta-data, citations and semantic information build using MeSH ontology. We compare those models in a search result clustering problem over the freely accessed biomedical research articles from Pubmed Cetral (PMC) portal.

We consider the issue of using fewer topics in the effectiveness evaluation of information retrieval systems. Previous work has shown that using fewer topics is theoretically possible; one of the main issues that remains to be solved is how to find such a small set of a few good topics. To this aim, in this paper we try a novel approach based on clustering of topics.

Less than 0.2% of these proteins, however, have added experimental GO annotations. To reduce this huge gap, automatic protein function prediction (AFP) becomes increasingly important. Results on CAFA (the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms) benchmark demonstrates that sequence homology based methods are highly competitive in AFP. One imperative issues will be incorporating other information sources other than sequence for AFP. In contrast to using BOW (bag of words) representation in traditional text-based AFP, we proposed a new method called DeepText2GO to improve large-scale AFP by using deep semantic text representation instead. Furthermore, DeepText2GO integrates both text-based and sequence homology-based methods through a consensus approach. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset extracted from UniProt/SwissProt have demonstrated that DeepText2GO significantly outperformed both text-based and sequence homology-based methods, validating its superiority.	algorithm;bag-of-words model;benchmark (computing);critical assessment of function annotation;experiment;imperative programming;peptide sequence;protein function prediction;sequence homology;text-based (computing);uniprot	Ronghui You;Shanfeng Zhu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217622	computer science;uniprot;bioinformatics;ontology (information science);protein function prediction;bag-of-words model;semantics;protein engineering;benchmark (computing);annotation	Vision	-29.681175797236566	-64.94818595768902	174417

In this paper, we describe an automatic author name tagger for academic articles scanned with optical character recognition (OCR) mark-up. The method uses conditional random fields (CRF) for labeling the unsegmented character strings in authors' blocks as those of either an author or a delimiter. We applied the tagger to Japanese academic articles. The results of the experiments showed that it correctly labeled more than 99% of the author name strings, which compares favorably with the under 96% correct rate of our previous tagger based on a hidden Markov model (HMM).	brill tagger;conditional random field;delimiter;digital library;experiment;hidden markov model;library (computing);markov chain;optical character recognition;printing;tag (metadata)	Manabu Ohta;Atsuhiro Takasu	2008		10.1145/1378889.1378935	digital library;speech recognition;computer science;optical character recognition;world wide web;conditional random field;information retrieval	NLP	-30.72012887221514	-66.01391117892966	175286
068ce8fadaaabd4659d8c9f2b3f8909283dd3db8	the university college london at trec 2008 enterprise track	information systems;information retrieval;searching;united kingdom;documents	The University College London Information Retrieval Group participated in both the Expert Search and Document Search tasks in the TREC2008 Enterprise Track. We used a generic two-stage approach, which consists of a document retrieval stage followed by an expert association discovery stage, for expert finding. Since document search is an integral part of our expert finding approach, we have studied the relationship between document search and expert search. Due to the existence of rich features that can potentially contribute to expert finding, our expert finding approach integrates these features including anchor texts, indegree, and multiple levels of associations between experts and query terms. Our experimental results show that the introduction of features has helped improve the expert finding performance. 1. I%TRODUCTIO% Same as in TREC2007 Enterprise Track, the domain for TREC2008 Enterprise Track is the website of the CSIRO (Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization). The topics were developed in order to reflect the requests of information received by the CSIRO Enquiries staffers. The aim of the two tasks is to find a number of key pages and experts on a topic that can help the staffers to answer each request. For example, find key experts and key pages to answer the request for information on ‚Äúcane toad‚Äù. Based on our approach that integrates multiple features in a two-stage expert finding model [4], we have continued investigating the effects of these features as follows in expert finding. Anchor texts: anchor texts of a document often highlight its key topic. Sometimes, keywords for identifying a document‚Äôs topic may even be missing in the document itself but exist in its anchor texts, e.g. the BMW homepage does not mention ‚Äúcar‚Äù, but anchor texts pointing to the page often do. We have studied the effect of anchor texts in both expert and document search. Indegree: Typically, the number of inlinks of a document is an indicator of the document‚Äôs authority. Previous work shows that there is a strong correlation between the number of inlinks and PageRank [1], and PageRank and indegree help document search on the Web [2]. We will study the effect of indegree in both document and expert search. Multiple levels of associations: We have continued using our multiple window based cooccurrence model [4]. The assumption is that there are multiple levels of associations between an expert and query terms in documents. We give higher weights to co-occurrences in smaller windows and lower weights to co-occurrences in larger windows. We have studied different window selections and combinations. In [3], we studied the relationship between ad hoc retrieval and expert finding via three parameters, namely, a background smoothing parameter in a language model, and anchor texts and indegree. Our experiments on the TREC 2007 Enterprise Track CSIRO dataset have shown that improvement in document retrieval does not necessarily lead to improvement in expert finding. Firstly, smoothing language model by a background collection model can significantly improve ad hoc retrieval performance, but does not help or even hurt expert finding. Accordingly, we give background smoothing different weights for expert and document search, respectively. Secondly, anchor text does not help document retrieval, and hurts document retrieval when weighted high in document retrieval, and indegree only slight helps ad hoc retrieval. Therefore, anchor texts and indegree have different effect in intranet search than in Web search [2]. The reason might be that, in document retrieval, documents are largely judged as relevant or not regardless of their authoritativeness, and anchor text and indegree may introduce more noise than useful information in document retrieval. However, both anchor text and indegree help expert finding.

Materials relevant to LIS are scattered in the journals of many fields, and a search of one or two databases may miss relevant items. The purpose of this research was to begin to gather data to construct a mapping of LIS topics in non-LIS databases. Subject terms were taken at random from LISA, categorized, and put into BRSu0027s CROSS database. A cluster analysis was conducted on the resulting 10.8 million postings to discover possible subject relationships among the databases. A search strategy was then developed using words which describe libraries, librarianship, and information science, and real searches conducted. A total of 168,673 hits were obtained and 2655 abstracts analyzed as to relevance. Precision estimates for each database tended to verify the clustering and gave further clues as to possibly fruitful search paths. The results showed that the clustering process is a useful starting point to characterize databases, and that there are many documents relevant to LIS in non-LIS databases. ¬© 1990 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.	bibliographic database;library and information science	A.

This paper presents a novel extractive approach based on manifold-ranking of sentences to this summarization task. The manifold-ranking process can naturally make full use of both the relationships among all the sentences in the documents and the relationships between the given topic and the sentences. The ranking score is obtained for each sentence in the manifold-ranking process to denote the biased information richness of the sentence. Then the greedy algorithm is employed to impose diversity penalty on each sentence. The summary is produced by choosing the sentences with both high biased information richness and high information novelty. Experiments on DUC2003 and DUC2005 are performed and the ROUGE evaluation results show that the proposed approach can significantly outperform existing approaches of the top performing systems in DUC tasks and baseline approaches.	automatic summarization;baseline (configuration management);greedy algorithm;machine learning;multi-document summarization;upsampling;user profile	Xiaojun Wan;Jianwu Yang;Jianguo Xiao	2007			greedy algorithm;multi-document summarization;computer science;automatic summarization;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;information retrieval	AI	-26.576827066189246	-62.41203568887493	177814

This paper proposes the technique of document expansion to provide more knowledge to help single document summarization. A specified document is expanded to a small document set by adding a few neighbor documents close to the document, and then the graphranking based algorithm is applied on the expanded document set for extracting sentences from the single document, by making use of both the within-document relationships between sentences of the specified document and the cross-document relationships between sentences of all documents in the document set. The experimental results on the DUC2002 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on document expansion. The cross-document relationships between sentences in the expanded document set are validated to be very important for single document summarization.	algorithm;automatic summarization;web page	Xiaojun Wan;Jianwu Yang	2007			well-formed document;multi-document summarization;document clustering;computer science;automatic summarization;document layout analysis;data mining;tf‚Äìidf;world wide web;information retrieval;design document listing	AI	-27.97941032864482	-63.85335232049876	177843

The proposed method groups the documents on the basis of their content and with assistance of DBpedia knowledge base. The text corpus is first treated with Natural Language Processing tools in order to produce vector representations of the content and then matched against a collection of concepts retrieved from DBpedia. As a result, a new representation is constructed that better reflects the semantics of the texts. With this new representation, the documents are hierarchically clustered in order to form partition of papers that share semantic relatedness. The steps in textual data preparation, utilization of DBpedia and clustering are explained and illustrated with results of experiments performed on a corpus of scientific documents about rough sets.	dbpedia;rough set	Marcin S.

The system was trained and tested on assignments from an introductory computer science course, and produced results that are comparable to the most popular plagiarism detectors.	artificial neural network;capacitor plague;computer science;kerrison predictor;neural network software;relevance;sensor;text-based (computing)	Steve Engels;Vivek Lakshmanan;Michelle Craig	2007		10.1145/1227310.1227324	feature;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;data mining;artificial neural network	NLP	-31.463760601617608	-65.50084674897029	178190

This technique is based on an ontological representation of documents and queries. We use a multilingual ontology for documents/queries representation. For each language, we use the multilingual ontology to map a term to its corresponding concept. The same mapping is applied to each document and each query. Then, we use a classic vector space model for the indexing and the querying. The main advantages of our approach are: no merging phase is required, no dependency on automatic translators between all pairs of languages exists, and adding a new language only requires a new mapping dictionary to the multilingual ontology.	dictionary;information retrieval;ontology (information science)	Jacques Guyot;Sa√Ød Radhouani;Gilles Falquet	2005			computer science;machine learning;database;world wide web;vector space model;information retrieval	Web+IR	-32.492267515145144	-66.04473219737875	179209

Learning is performed on documents which have been disambiguated by exploiting the WordNet lexical database, in an attempt to discover concepts describing user interests. The proposed approach relies on several additional features compared to classical lexical knowledge systems, including: structured user recommendation, numeric value management, definition of strict and negotiable constraints and keywords to retrieve potential interesting resources w.r.t. both user request and profile.	categorization;document classification;experiment;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;lexical database;prototype;semantic search;similarity measure;text-based (computing);user profile;web search engine;wordnet	Eufemia Tinelli;Pierpaolo Basile;Eugenio Di Sciascio;Giovanni Semeraro	2006			computer science;artificial intelligence;knowledge-based systems;data mining;database;information retrieval	Web+IR	-29.54020657930812	-59.35304243436661	179465

We explored indexing and searching at both the record level and the document level with the Enron email collection. We studied the usefulness of fielded search and document presentation features such as clustering documents based on email threads. For query formulation for the selected search topic, we combined a precision-oriented Specific Query method that a recall-oriented Generic Query method. Future evaluation of the effectiveness of these query techniques is still needed.	buffalo network-attached storage series;cluster analysis;email;knowledge discovery metamodel	Jianqiang Wang;Ying Sun;Paul Thompson	2009			web query classification;information retrieval;data mining;web search query;computer science;cluster analysis;thread (computing);search engine indexing	Web+IR	-31.86564514339906	-63.00602255492773	179617
75965655c48b7e7d45acdbf3a3c53bc65a1d8fb4	a hybrid genetic-bootstrapping approach to link resources in the web of data		In the Web of Data, real-world entities are represented by means of resources, for instance the southern Spanish city ‚ÄúSeville‚Äù that is represented by means of the resource that is available at http://es.dbpedia.org/page/Sevilla in the DBpedia dataset. Link rules are intended to link resources that are different, but represent the same real-world entities; for instance the resource that is available at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8717 represents exactly the same real-world entity as the resource aforementioned. A link rule may establish that two resources that represent cities should be linked as long as the GPS coordinates are the same. Such rules are then paramount to integrating web data, because otherwise programs would deal with every resource independently from the other. Knowing that the previous resources represent the same real-world entity allows them to merge the information that they provide independently (which is commonly known as integrating link data). State-of-the-art link rules are learnt by genetic programming systems and build on comparing the values of the attributes of the resources. Unfortunately, this approach falls short in cases in which resources have similar values for their attributes, but represent different real-world entities. In this paper, we present a proposal that hybridises a genetic programming system that learns link rules and an ad-hoc filtering technique that bootstraps them to decide whether the links that they produce must be selected or not. Our analysis of the literature reveals that our approach is novel and our experimental analysis confirms that it helps improve the (F_1) score, which is defined in the literature as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, by increasing precision without a significant penalty on recall.	semantic web;world wide web	Andrea Cimmino;Rafael Corchuelo	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-92639-1_13	world wide web;machine learning;artificial intelligence;genetic programming;filter (signal processing);merge (version control);precision and recall;computer science;recall;bootstrapping;harmonic mean	Web+IR	-29.465651894403344	-61.19686384191558	180128
f23dae2eced0c7e30809f1e522a06f2c678c8d5c	a multilingual approach to discover cross-language links in wikipedia		Wikipedia is a well-known public and collaborative encyclopaedia consisting of millions of articles. Initially in English, the popular website has grown to include versions in over 288 languages. These versions and their articles are interconnected via cross-language links, which not only facilitate navigation and understanding of concepts in multiple languages, but have been used in natural language processing applications, developments in linked open data, and expansion of minor Wikipedia language versions. These applications are the motivation for an automatic, robust, and accurate technique to identify cross-language links. In this paper, we present a multilingual approach called EurekaCL to automatically identify missing cross-language links in Wikipedia. More precisely, given a Wikipedia article the source EurekaCL uses the multilingual and semantic features of BabelNet 2.0 in order to efficiently identify a set of candidate articles in a target language that are likely to cover the same topic as the source. The Wikipedia graph structure is then exploited both to prune and to rank the candidates. Our evaluation carried out on 42,000 pairs of articles in eight language versions of Wikipedia shows that our candidate selection and pruning procedures allow an effective selection of candidates which significantly helps the determination of the correct article in the target language version.	wikipedia	Nac√©ra Bennacer;Mia Johnson Vioul√®s;Maximiliano Ariel L√≥pez;Gianluca Quercini	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-26190-4_36	natural language processing;computer science;database;world wide web;information retrieval	ML	-29.060422914874607	-64.2332162289014	180212

We consider a result list most diverse, with respect to some set of topics related to the query, when the number of documents it provides on each topic is proportional to the topic's popularity. Consequently, we propose a framework for optimizing proportionality for search result diversification, which is motivated by the problem of assigning seats to members of competing political parties. Our technique iteratively determines, for each position in the result ranked list, the topic that best maintains the overall proportionality. It then selects the best document on this topic for this position. We demonstrate empirically that our method significantly outperforms the top performing approach in the literature not only on our proposed metric for proportionality, but also on several standard diversity measures. This result indicates that promoting proportionality naturally leads to minimal redundancy, which is a goal of the current diversity approaches.	diversification (finance)	Van Dang;W.

Thus the physics community provides us with an extensive supply of algorithms for extracting community structure. We present a novel method for semantically clustering a large collection of documents using small world communities. This method combines modified physics algorithms with traditional information retrieval techniques. A term network is generated from the document collection, the terms are clustered into small world communities, the semantic term clusters are used to generate overlapping document clusters. The algorithm combines the speed of single link with the quality of complete link. Clustering takes place in nearly real-time and the results are judged to be coherent by expert users. Our algorithm occupies a middle ground between speed and quality of document clustering.	algorithm;archive;cluster analysis;coherence (physics);information retrieval;natural language;real-time clock;real-time computing	Brant W.

The main goal of this paper is to show the impact of structural hints in XML query optimization.

In order to obtain experimental data, at the NTCIR-4 CLIR task, we submitted search results of Japanese monolingual run and three bilingual runs retrieving the Japanese document collection (i.e., Chinese-Japanese, Korean-Japanese and English-Japanese runs). It turns out that a regression model of which independent variables are ‚Äúquality‚Äù of query translation and ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù of the search in itself explains well variations of values of average precision by CLIR runs. The ‚Äúquality‚Äù of translations was measured as a score assigned by a human assessor based on the degree to which each translation is coincident with the corresponding term in the Japanese topic that the task organizers provided, and the ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù of the search was represented as a value of average precision by a run using the Japanese topic (i.e., monolingual run).	archive;cross-language information retrieval	Kazuaki Kishida;Kazuko Kuriyama;Noriko Kando;Koji Eguchi	2004			experimental data;regression analysis;coincident;information retrieval;variables;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science	Web+IR	-30.98778161433689	-63.57610501685811	181763

Applications such as Question Answering, reading tutors, and XML retrieval demand more robust retrieval on richly annotated documents. In order to effectively serve these applications, the community will need a better understanding of the combination of evidence. In this work, I propose that the use of simple generative probabilistic models will be an effective framework for these problems. Statistical language models, which are a special case of generative probabilistic models, have been used extensively within recent Information Retrieval research. Their flexibility has been very effective in adapting to numerous tasks and problems. I propose to extend the statistical language modeling framework to handle rich information needs and documents with structural and linguistic annotations. Much of the prior work on combination of evidence has had few well-studied theoretical contributions, so I also propose to develop a sounder theoretical basis which gives more predictable results.	information needs;information retrieval;language model;pervasive informatics;question answering;xml retrieval	Paul Ogilvie	2004		10.1145/1008992.1009151	natural language processing;statistical model;information needs;question answering;relevance;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;human‚Äìcomputer information retrieval	Web+IR	-29.21150701983104	-61.512293031427504	183574

The GOV2 collection was partitioned into host‚Äêname subcollections and distributed to multiple remote machines. The Multisearch demonstration application restricted each search to a fraction of the available sub‚Äêcollections that was pre‚Äêdetermined by a resource‚Äêselection algorithm. Experiment results from topic‚Äêby‚Äêtopic resource selection and aggregate topic resource selection are compared. The sensitivity of Multisearch retrieval performance to variations in the resource selection algorithm is discussed. The information processing research group at ARSC works on problems affecting the performance of distributed information retrieval applications such as metasearch [1], federated search [2], and collection sampling [3]. An ongoing goal of this research is to guide the selection of standards and reference implementations for Grid Information Retrieval (GIR) applications [4]. Prototype GIR applications developed at ARSC help to evaluate theoretical research and gain experience with the capabilities and limitations of existing APIs, middleware, and security requirements. The TREC experiments provide an additional context to test and develop distributed IR technology. Prior TREC Terabyte (TB) and Million Query (MQ) Track experiments performed at ARSC have explored the IR performance and search efficiency of result‚Äêset merging and ranking across small numbers of heterogeneous systems and large numbers of homogeneous systems. In the 2005 TREC [5] TB Track [6], the ARSC IR group used a variant of the logistic regression merging strategy [7], modified for efficiency, to merge results from a metasearch‚Äê style application that searched and merged results from two indexed copies of the GOV2 corpus [8]. One index was constructed with the Lucene Toolkit and the other index was constructed with the Amberfish application [9]. For the 2006 TREC [10] TB Track [11], the GOV2 corpus was partitioned into approximately 17,000 collections by grouping documents with identical URL host names [12]. Each query was searched against every collection and the ranked results from each collection were merged using the logistic regression algorithm used in the 2005 TB track. The large number of document collections used in the 2006 experiment, coupled with the distribution of collection size (measured in number of documents contained) that spanned five orders of magnitude, introduced significant wall‚Äêclock, bandwidth, and IR performance problems. Follow‚Äêup work found that the bandwidth performance could be improved somewhat without sacrificing IR performance by	aggregate data;experiment;federated search;information processing;information retrieval;logistic regression;middleware;prototype;requirement;result set;sampling (signal processing);selection algorithm;terabyte;text retrieval conference;text corpus	Christopher T.

Information extraction is an important task for easily using digital libraries. Sequence analyzers are usually used to extract information from pages. Because we often receive new layouts and the layouts also usually change, it is necessary to have a machenism for self-trainning a new analyzer to achieve a good extraction accuracy. This also makes the management becomes easier. For example, when the new layout is inputed, There is a problem of how we can learn automatically and efficiently to create a new analyzer. This paper focuses on learning a new sequence analyzer automatically by using transfer learning approach. We evaluated the efficiency by testing three academic journals. The results show that the proposed method is effective to self-train a new sequence analyer.	conditional random field;digital library;icpram;information extraction;library (computing);pattern recognition;semiconductor industry	Quang-Hong Vuong;Atsuhiro Takasu	2015			digital library;transfer of learning;computer science;data science;machine learning;world wide web;conditional random field;information retrieval	AI	-30.6444766011601	-65.93702174646114	184196
84bc7bddaeaeb0f8e67234358a754bec70f620a1	characterizing infrastructure damage after earthquake: a split-query based ir approach		Retrieving relevant information from social media based on specific requirements has become a focus area for researchers. In this paper, we propose a framework for online retrieval of tweets providing information about possible infrastructure damages, caused due to earthquakes and use the same to determine a damage score for the possibly affected locations. Identifying such tweets would not only provide a holistic view of the affected areas but would also help in taking necessary relief actions. Existing works on this topic fail to effectively capture the semantic variation in the tweets, possibly due to poor content quality, thereby providing scopes for further improvement in the mechanisms involved. Our proposed technique relies on a novel split-query based mechanism along with a pseudo-relevance feedback approach to identify the relevant tweets. The pseudo-relevance feedback approach expands on an initial set of seed tweets obtained using a semi-automatic query generation mechanism that couples topic based clustering with human annotation. Empirical validation of our proposed method on a manually annotated ground truth data reveals a considerable improvement in precision, recall and mean average precision over several baseline methods.	baseline (configuration management);cluster analysis;ground truth;holism;information retrieval;multimodal interaction;query expansion;relevance feedback;requirement;semantic similarity;semiconductor industry;social media;text corpus;word2vec	Shalini Priya;Manish Bhanu;Sourav Kumar Dandapat;Kripabandhu Ghosh;Joydeep Chandra	2018	2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508752	data mining;cluster analysis;social media;ground truth;annotation;computer science	SE	-27.583196557491426	-64.78216910458592	184505

For the Genomics Track primary task, we used an amalgamation of retrieval and query expansion techniques, including tiering, term re-wr iting and pseudo-relevance feedback. For the Robust Track, we examined the impact of pseudo-relevance feedback on retrie val effectiveness under the new robustness measures. All of our TREC runs were generated by the MultiText System, a collection of tools and techniques for informatio n retrieval, question answering and structured text search. The MultiText Project at the University of Waterloo has been developing this system since 1993 and has participated in TREC annually since TREC-4 in 1995. In the next section, we briefly review the retrieval methods used in our TREC 2003 runs. Depending on the track, various combinations of these methods were used to generate our runs.

In this paper we present our participation as SINAI research group from the Universidad de Ja√©n at Task 3 ‚ÄúConsumer Health Search‚Äù specifically in sub-task 1 ‚ÄúAd-hoc Search‚Äù. The main objective of the task is to provide relevant information to people seeking health advice on the web. We apply the query expansion technique using the most famous search engine at the moment: Google. We search additional information related to the query using the search engine. We identify the medical concepts in Google results using cTAKES. This recognizer provides UMLS concepts from a given text. In this way, we avoid introducing noise with words that are not related to the user query. Our system improves NDCG@10 measurement by 48% over the previous year. We also significantly reduces the response time of the Information Retrieval System (IRS) by 90% compared to previous years.	finite-state machine;hoc (programming language);query expansion;response time (technology);web search engine;ctakes	Manuel Carlos D√≠az-Galiano;Pilar L√≥pez-√öbeda;Mar√≠a Teresa Mart√≠n-Valdivia;Luis Alfonso Ure√±a L√≥pez	2018			information retrieval;ehealth;clef;computer science	Web+IR	-32.16881201800458	-63.11197160346698	186579

Typical information retrieval formalisms such as the vector space model, the best-match model and the language model first combine features (such as term frequency and document length) into a unified representation, and then use the representation to rank documents. We take the opposite approach: Documents are first ranked by the relevance of a single feature value and are assigned scores based on their relative ordering within the collection. A separate ranked list is created for every feature value and these lists are then fused to produce a final document scoring. This new """"rank then combine"""" approach is extensively evaluated and is shown to be as effective as traditional """"combine then rank"""" approaches. The model is easy to understand and contains fewer parameters than other approaches. Finally, the model is easy to extend (integration of new features is trivial) and modify. This advantage includes but is not limited to relevance feedback and distribution flattening."""	hoc (programming language);information retrieval;language model;relevance feedback;systems design;tf‚Äìidf	Jeremy Pickens;Gene Golovchinsky	2008		10.1145/1458082.1458200	computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;database;tf‚Äìidf;world wide web;vector space model;information retrieval;feature model;language model;systems design	Web+IR	-33.2649373255597	-61.65422825895422	186674

Though the design of our system (CipCipPy) is pretty standard it includes three ad-hoc solutions for the track: (i) a dedicated indexing function for hashtags that automatically recognizes the distinct words composing an hashtag, (ii) expansion of tweets based on the title of any referred Web page, and (iii) a tweet ranking function that ranks tweets in results by their content quality, which is compared against a reference corpus of Reuters news. In this preliminary paper we describe all the components of our system, and the efficacy scored by our runs.

7e1bdf8c9822a735fa2c0cf41275eba4deaaef16	semcluster: unsupervised automatic keyphrase extraction using affinity propagation		Keyphrases provide important semantic metadata for organizing and managing free-text documents. As data grow exponentially, there is a pressing demand for automatic and efficient keyphrase extraction methods. We introduce in this paper SemCluster, a clustering-based unsupervised keyphrase extraction method. By integrating an internal ontology (i.e., WordNet) with external knowledge sources, SemCluster identifies and extracts semantically important terms from a given document, clusters the terms, and, using the clustering results as heuristics, identifies the most representative phrases and singles them out as keyphrases. SemCluster is evaluated against two baseline unsupervised methods, TextRank and KeyCluster, over the Inspec dataset under an F1-measure metric. The evaluation results clearly show that SemCluster outperforms both methods.	affinity propagation;approximation algorithm;babelfy;baseline (configuration management);big data;cluster analysis;computation;f1 score;heuristic (computer science);organizing (structure);semantic similarity;social network;software propagation;text corpus;video post-processing;word sense;word-sense disambiguation;wordnet	Hassan H.

Existing approaches, most remarkably the language model based on the Information Flow method are however unable to capture multiple levels of associations and also suffer from a high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose to compute association rules from pseudo feedback documents that are segmented into variable length chunks via multiple sliding windows of different sizes.

30feade758d15844a5746fd0de7983d5a0e4af02	rouge 2.0: updated and improved measures for evaluation of summarization tasks		Evaluation of summarization tasks is extremely crucial to determining the quality of machine generated summaries. Over the last decade, ROUGE has become the standard automatic evaluation measure for evaluating summarization tasks. While ROUGE has been shown to be effective in capturing n-gram overlap between system and human composed summaries, there are several limitations with the existing ROUGE measures in terms of capturing synonymous concepts and coverage of topics. Thus, often times ROUGE scores do not reflect the true quality of summaries and prevents multi-faceted evaluation of summaries (i.e. by topics, by overall content coverage and etc). In this paper, we introduce ROUGE 2.0, which has several updated measures of ROUGE: ROUGE-N+Synonyms, ROUGE-Topic, ROUGETopic+Synonyms, ROUGE-TopicUniq and ROUGE-TopicUniq+Synonyms; all of which are improvements over the core ROUGE measures.	automatic summarization;faceted classification;n-gram;rouge (metric)	Kavita Ganesan	2018	CoRR		information retrieval;rouge;data mining;automatic summarization;computer science;synonym	NLP	-26.757178260881282	-65.50711601641329	190352

Recent probabilistic XML models represent different dependency correlations of sibling nodes by adding various kinds of distributional nodes, while there does not exist a uniform probability calculation method for different dependency correlations. Since Bayesian Networks can denote various dependency correlations among nodes just by conditional probability table(CPT), this paper proposes the Bayesian Networks based probabilistic XML model PrXML-BN, and combines SLCA semantic meaning of keyword query into Bayesian Networks, then implements keywords filtering on SLCA semantic meaning. To optimize the performance of keywords filtering, two optimization strategies are proposed in this paper. In the end, experiments verify the performance of keywords filtering algorithm based on SLCA in model PrXML-BN.	bayesian network;xml	Chenjing Zhang;Kun Yue;Jinghua Zhu;Xiaoling Wang;Aoying Zhou	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29023-7_28	computer science;machine learning;bayesian network;data mining;database;information retrieval	Web+IR	-28.384200563538084	-61.54430860460568	190423

We define rare information as relevant and atypical information. We propose two approaches. In the first approach, we use social bookmark data. We introduce tag estimation to our previous work. The second approach is based on word co-occurrence in a dataset. In both approaches, we use conditional probabilities to express relevancy and atypicality. In experiments, we compared our methods with the relevance-oriented method, the diversity-oriented method, and another rarity-oriented method.

However, little research has been done for automatic recommendation of PC candidates. PC member finding is a complex task, which could be influenced by many factors such as the candidates' research interests' match with conference topics, the candidates' social closeness with PC chairs, the candidates' authoritativeness, as well as the candidates' publication history in the conference. To examine the importance of each feature, we build a dataset that consists of papers from four conferences: KDD, SIGIR, JCDL and GIS (2007-2011) and split it into the training and testing subsets based on the temporal information. The results show that: i) the publication history is the strongest indicator of being PC members; ii) recommendations based on the social closeness also produce reasonable good results; iii) recommend high authority researchers as PC members fails to predict the real PC because there are a large proportion of PC members who actually only have low authority values (we use the PageRank value in coauthor networks to simulate researcher's authority); and iv) applying simple linear combination of different features can make reasonable improvements.	centrality;functional programming;geographic information system;joint conference on digital libraries;pagerank;simulation	Shuguang Han;Jiepu Jiang;Zhen Yue;Daqing He	2013		10.1145/2508497.2508498	public relations;computer science;data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-29.970719846431837	-62.23970996172876	191784
fa68f426d2cef14515abc32547cf497fc50a9b2a	a multiobjective optimization based entity matching technique for bibliographic databases		With the increasing use of on-line resources, the size of the bibliographic database is growing day by day. The available huge amount of data belong to various entities. It is difficult to automatically identify the records which belong to a particular entity. Mapping the records to the corresponding entity is termed as the entity matching problem. In bibliographic database many attributes change over time. For example affiliation of an author changes frequently. Many authors generally use different email-ids. The names of co-authors also change with time. All these aspects have made the entity matching problem challenging. Generally an entity matching task is carried out by constructing a feature vector to represent a record, then a classifier is trained to classify each feature vector. But for bibliographic database it is very difficult and time consuming to generate some manually annotated labeled data to train a classifier. Inspired by this observation, we have proposed an unsupervised approach for entity matching problem using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). A new encoding strategy is used to encode the clusters in the form of a chromosome. New mutation and crossover operators are proposed which are suitable for bibliographic data clustering. Different distance measures are used to measure the dissimilarities between records. Finally, solutions are evolved using the search capability of NSGA-II. Experimental evaluations are carried out with 247 different combinations of eight objective functions for eight different bibliographic datasets. A comparative analysis with two existing systems DBLP and ArnetMiner, shows that the proposed technique can produce better results in many cases. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

8d59d9249a93b520870d41a3dfdb9cf1f1ee1eda	literal node matching based on image features toward linked data integration		Linked Open Data (LOD) has a graph structure in which nodes are represented by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), and thus LOD sets are connected and searched through different domains. In fact, however, 5% of the values are literal (string without URI) even in DBpedia, which is a de facto hub of LOD. Since the literal becomes a terminal node, and we need to rely on regular expression matching, we cannot trace the links in the LOD graphs during searches. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of identifying and aggregating literal nodes that have the same meaning in order to facilitate cross-domain search through links in LOD. The novelty of our method is that part of the LOD graph structure is regarded as a block image, and then image features of LOD are extracted. In experiments, we created about 30,000 literal pairs from a Japanese music category of DBpedia Japanese and Freebase, and confirmed that the proposed method correctly determines literal identity with F-measure of 99%.	linked data;literal (mathematical logic)	Takahiro Kawamura;Shinichi Nagano;Akihiko Ohsuga	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09912-5_15	computer science;theoretical computer science;pattern recognition;algorithm	Vision	-28.162908689290227	-65.50574806691408	192725

Our system has a superficial text analysis based approach. The methodology starts with the preprocessing of background collection documents, whose texts are lemmatized and then indexed. Named entities and numerical expressions are sought in questions and their candidate answers. Then the lemmatizer is applied and stop words are removed. Answer patterns are formed for each question+answer pair, with a search query for document retrieval. Original search terms are expanded with synonyms and hyperonyms. Finally, the texts retrieved for each candidate response are segmented and scored for answer selection. Considering only the main questions, the system best result was obtained in the third run, having answered to 206 questions, with 0.24 c@1 and 51 correct answers. When evaluating main and auxiliary questions, the final run continued to have our better results, being answered 245 questions, with 64 right answers and 0.26 for c@1. The use of hypernyms proved to be an improvement factor in the third run, which results had a 12% increase of correct answers and a 0.02 gain in c@1.	anaphora (linguistics);document retrieval;entity;failure cause;google questions and answers;lemmatisation;numerical analysis;preprocessor;the superficial;word-sense disambiguation	Marilia Santos;Jos√© Saias;Paulo Quaresma	2013			computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;information retrieval	NLP	-31.537271425384887	-64.5969082539719	192808

In this paper we present an approach to detect external plagiarism based on textual similarity. This is an efficient and precise method that can be applied over large sets of documents. The system that we have developed contains a first phase of document selection that uses a variant of tf -idf applied over the terms that appear in the two documents of the pair being compared. After this is done, we apply a more complex and accurate function based on character n-grams over the subset of documents resulting from the first step in order to extract the plagiarized passages, or matches. Once all matches for a given document are extracted, we perform a greedy match merging operation to allow in-between text in order to be compatible with certain levels of plagiarism obfuscation. In our participation in the 2nd International Competition on Plagiarism Detection, we achieved an overall score of 0.2222, ranking 11 out of 18 participants.	grams;greedy algorithm;n-gram	Daniel Micol;√ìscar Ferr√°ndez;Fernando Llopis;Rafael Mu√±oz	2010			computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-31.12528850273712	-64.73146869082943	193111

Microblog documents such as tweets differ in morphology with respect to more traditional documents such as web pages. Particularly, tweets are considerably shorter (140 characters) than web documents and contain contextual tags regarding the topic (hashtags), intended audience (mentions) of the document as well as links to external content(URLs).  Traditional and state of the art retrieval models perform rather poorly in capturing the relevance of tweets, since they have been designed under very different conditions. In this work, we define a microblog document as a high-dimensional entity and study the structural differences between those documents deemed relevant and those non-relevant. Secondly we experiment with enhancing the behaviour of the best observed performing retrieval model by means of a re-ranking approach that accounts for the relative differences in these dimensions amongst tweets. Additionally we study the interactions between the different dimensions in terms of their order within the documents by modelling relevant and non-relevant tweets as state machines. These state machines are then utilised to produce scores which in turn are used for re-ranking.  Our evaluation results show statistically significant improvements over the baseline in terms of precision at different cut-off points for both approaches. These results confirm that the relative presence of the different dimensions within a document and their ordering are connected with the relevance of microblogs.	baseline (configuration management);galaxy morphological classification;hashtag;hoc (programming language);interaction;relevance;web page	Jesus A.

An open issue, however, is how to collect suitable classes of sample pages to feed the wrapper inducer. Presently, the pages are chosen manually.In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically discovering the main classes of pages offered by a site by exploring only a small, representative, portion of it. The web site model we propose describes the structure of the site as a graph whose nodes are classes of pages that share a common structure, and whose edges represent links among instances of the page classes. Using this model, we have developed an algorithm that accepts the url of an entry point to the target web site, visits a limited portion of the site, and produces an accurate model of the site structure. We also report on preliminary experiments performed on actual web sites, that have produced encouraging results.	algorithm;entry point;experiment;html;world wide web;wrapper library;xml	Valter Crescenzi;Paolo Merialdo;Paolo Missier	2003		10.1145/956699.956703	static web page;site map;digital library;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;website parse template;information extraction;information retrieval;research	DB	-31.42137862362326	-61.021694131036895	194995

The Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) criterion strives to reduce redundancy while maintaining query relevance in re-ranking retrieved documents and in selecting apprw priate passages for text summarization. Preliminary results indicate some benefits for MMR diversity ranking in document retrieval and in single document summarization. The latter are borne out by the recent results of the SUMMAC conference in the evaluation of summarization systems. However, the clearest advantage is demonstrated in constructing non-redundant multi-document summaries, where MMR results are clearly superior to non-MMR passage selection.	automatic summarization;document retrieval;marginal model;maximal set;multi-master replication;relevance feedback	Jaime G.

A sliding window of three shots is used to create a """" bag of words """" representation of the shot. F_A_1_ESRG_KN2_2 The second run is a required baseline, using no text from the ASR/MT output. This run uses visual keypoint features with shot description expansion using a semantic network.

Shot description expansion using a semantic network is applied to both feature sets. F_A_2_ESRG_AKNF5_5 The fifth run is an optional run using a weighted fusion model with the ASR and visual keypoint features, shot description expansion, and automatic relevance feedback. Our primary focus in TRECVID 2007 is the evaluation of retrieval utilities on a video search system. We apply both automatic relevance feedback and shot (document) expansion using a semantic network. These utilities have proven to be very effective in the text retrieval domain. Our top MAP was found in the second run, consisting of visual keypoint features with shot description expansion.

They ignore the conceptual relationships of terms such as synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms and, especially, treat terms as a bag of terms. The application of conceptual relationships of terms has been proved by generating improved results for document clustering in previous studies. For those studies, thesauri like WordNet were used to provide the information of relationships between terms. However, some domain-specific terms like """"query expansion"""" and """"document clustering"""" cannot be found in these thesauri. These terms are thought of as important features in domain-specific documents. In this paper, we propose an automatic domain-specific thesaurus building approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) dealing with the problem with general thesauri. We also apply the domain-specific thesaurus as background knowledge to represent documents by concept dimension vectors.

Thus, devising content-based relevance estimation (ranking) approaches becomes highly challenging. We address this challenge using two methods that utilize inter-document similarities in an initially retrieved list. The first removes documents from the list that exhibit high query similarity, but for which there is insufficient additional support for relevance that is based on inter-document similarities. The method is based on a probabilistic model that decouples document-query similarities from relevance estimation. The second method re-ranks the list by """"rewarding"""" documents that exhibit high similarity both to the query and to other documents in the list.

Maverick is built upon a beam-search based algorithmic framework which we proposed in a research paper that is published in SIGMOD 2018. In this demonstration proposal, we showcase an end-to-end system that includes a user-facing portal and a cache server. In Maverick, an exceptional fact about an entity of interest is modeled as a contextsubspace pair, in which the subspace is a set of attributes and the context is defined by a graph query pattern of which the entity is a match, together with other matching entities. The entity is exceptional among the entities in the context, with regard to the subspace. The portal allows users to search entities in a knowledge graph and explores exceptional facts about the entities of interest. It presents exceptional facts to users in forms of natural language sentences and illustration charts, for better interpretability of the discovered exceptional facts. The cache server stores intermediate computation results, such as pattern evaluations, exceptionality calculations, and candidate patterns. It is built for sharing computation across entities, such that repetitive computation across entities can be avoided. PVLDB Reference Format: Gensheng Zhang, and Chengkai Li.

Several approaches have been reported for mining comparable entities from Web sources to improve user experience in comparing entities online. However, these efforts extract only entities explicitly compared in the corpora, and may exclude entities that occur less-frequently but potentially comparable. To build a more complete comparison machine that can infer such missing relations, here we develop a solution to predict transitivity of known comparable relations. Named CLIQUEGROW, our approach predicts missing links given a comparable entity graph obtained from versus query logs.

70597716614b2887b167b1863dd651bfdc2d0a70	open set evaluation of web genre identification		Web genre detection is a task that can enhance information retrieval systems by providing rich descriptions of documents and enabling more specialized queries. Most of previous studies in this field adopt the closed-set scenario where a given palette comprises all available genre labels. However this is not a realistic setup since web genres are constantly enriched with new labels and existing web genres are evolving in time. Open-set classification, where some pages used in the evaluation phase do not belong to any of the known genres, is a more realistic setup for this task. In this case, all pages not belonging to known genres can be seen as noise. This paper focuses on systematic evaluation of open-set web genre identification when the noise is either structured or unstructured. Two open-set methods combined with alternative text representation schemes and similarity measures are tested based on two benchmark corpora. Moreover, we adopt the openness test for web genre identification that enables the observation of effectiveness for a varying number of known/unknown labels.		Dimitrios A.
