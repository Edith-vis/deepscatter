774c9037b79d11e14a033d1a3f15e709b864f593	formalizing rest apis for web-based communication and sip interworking	web services;internet of services;rest;final state models;call control;sip	Significant research efforts for the convergence of web and telecommunication services have been recently spent by research and industry stakeholders. The IETF and W3C are cooperating in specifying how web browsers should evolve to natively support communication services. In this perspective, devising novel mechanisms for signaling message exchange and possible interworking between Web- and SIP-based systems is a hot topic of research. Indeed, discussions are still ongoing on how differences between REpresentational state transfer (REST) and session initiation protocol (SIP) models should be coped with. This issue is made more difficult by the lack of rigorous modeling of RESTful systems. In this paper we propose a rigorous approach for design and implementation of REST communication services (e.g., a call service) which leverages formal verification techniques, while allowing to meet a specific performance requirement (i.e., maximum call setup delay). First, we formalize the call resource behavior through a Finite State Machine representation by modeling and simulating service expected behavior and its interworking with SIP User Agents through a tool for the analysis of communicating state machines. Then, we use the model-checking capabilities offered by the tool for the verification of formal properties. Finally, we implement a prototype that, thanks to the previous formalization step, is shown to be functionally correct, while yielding acceptable performance.	web application	Federica Paganelli;Terence Ambra;Alessandro Fantechi;Dino Giuli	2017	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-016-0271-2	real-time computing;computer network;web application;session initiation protocol;finite-state machine;web service;call control;computer science;representational state transfer;formal verification;user agent	Logic	-47.69545308140944	18.163039986395773	159152

An XML Schema document describes a shared resource. By applying transformations, specified in XSL, the schema is used to generate an application with the ability to publish and search for the defined object. Meta-data is indexed and searchable allowing complex objects to be discovered. We propose to solve the problem of discovery for resource-sharing communities by treating a community as a shared resource. An XML Schema description of resource-sharing communities is used to generate a P2P system for community discovery.	peer-to-peer;xml schema	Aloke Mukherjee;Babak Esfandiari;Neal Arthorne	2002		10.1109/ICDCSW.2002.1030850	shared resource;xml validation;xsl;application software;xml;index term;resource allocation;computer science;document structure description;knowledge engineering;peer-to-peer;xml schema;database;programming language;metadata;world wide web;xml schema editor;information retrieval;bandwidth;robustness	DB	-41.36673113973891	12.450258213506544	159392

On the one hand, our Semantic Alliance framework follows an invasive approach: Users can profit from semantic technology without having to leave their accustomed workflows and tools. On the other hand, Semantic Alliance offers a largely application-independent way of extending existing (open API) applications with MKM technologies. The Semantic Alliance framework presented in this paper consists of three components: i.) a universal semantic interaction manager for given abstract document types, ii.) a set of thin APIs realized as invasive exten-document types, ii.) a set of thin APIs realized as invasive extensions to particular applications, and iii.) a set of renderer components for existing semantic services. We validate the Semantic Alliance approach by instantiating it with a spreadsheet-specific interaction manager, thin APIs for LibreOffice Calc 3.4 and MS Excel’10.	application programming interface;computer algebra system;computer-aided design;desktop computer;embedded system;graphical user interface;interaction;java;libreoffice calc;maple;mathematical knowledge management;open api;reference implementation;software framework;spreadsheet;theos;web application;web service;wolfram mathematica	Catalin David;Constantin Jucovschi;Andrea Kohlhase;Michael Kohlhase	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31374-5_4	semantic data model;semantic interoperability;semantic similarity;semantic computing;semantic integration;semantic search;semantic grid;computer science;social semantic web;data mining;semantic web stack;semantic compression;database;semantic equivalence;semantic technology;world wide web;semantic analytics	SE	-41.60192762319534	12.93986534255582	159415

Under the circumstances of service aggregation, in order to adapt the centralized access control between the service application system subject and object in the environment of WEB configurations, this paper proposed the Situation Framework based Cooperation Access Control Model. First of all, this paper analyzed the constitution of dynamic Situation factors of access controls in the service application systems and defining the factor of situation from multi-perspective; Moreover, this paper provided the concept of dynamic Situation finite state machine and present a system cooperation access gateway model supporting calculations and rules of the situation under the constraint of dynamic situations. Furthermore, based on the CP-ABE algorithm, this paper provides the SISA algorithm which strongly enhances the security of the finite state machine changing and data exchanging during the process of service aggregation. Finally, the music service aggregation case shows the feasibility and validation of the SISA model compared with other traditional access control model and summarized the relative innovativeness between SISA model and existing access control models.	algorithm;centralized computing;computer access control;finite-state machine;world wide web	Min Wang;Yongbin Wang	2016	2016 17th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)	10.1109/SNPD.2016.7515950	computer science;knowledge management;access control;manganese;machine learning;data mining;database;computer security;collaboration	DB	-44.374207247875475	16.4836325687836	161030

However, existing approaches are inefficient. This paper presents a novel agent-based collaborative approach to address this problem. We introduce a negotiation protocol, under which the agents on the service providers’ side collaborate by exchanging information with each other to gain global knowledge of the negotiation. The collaboration can facilitate the progress of the negotiation. We also discuss the corresponding impact on the decision making strategies.	agent-based model;multi-agent system;prototype;service composability principle;service-level agreement;service-oriented modeling;the australian	Qiang He;Jun Yan;Yun Yang;Ryszard Kowalczyk;Hai Jin	2007			public relations;service level objective;knowledge management;business;computer security	AI	-43.94307652895021	17.27867289107063	161049

Current approaches for services retrieval are mostly limited to the matching of their inputs/outputs possibly enhanced with some ontological knowledge. Recent works have demonstrated that this approach is not sufficient to discover relevant components. Motivated by these concerns, we have developed BeMatch platform for ranking web services based on behavior matchmaking. We developed matching techniques that operate on behavior models and allow delivery of partial matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and user requirements. Consequently, even if a service satisfying exactly the user requirements does not exist, the most similar ones will be retrieved and proposed for reuse by extension or modification. We exemplify our approach for behavioral services matchmaking by describing two demonstration scenarios for matchmaking BPEL and WSCL protocols, respectively. A demo scenario is also described concerning the tool for evaluating the effectiveness of the behavioral matchmaking method.	business process execution language;component-based software engineering;computation;exemplification;requirement;user requirements document;web service	Juan Carlos Corrales;Daniela Grigori;Mokrane Bouzeghoub;Javier Ernesto Burbano	2008		10.1145/1353343.1353428	behavioral modeling;web service;input/output;computer science;user requirements document;component-based software engineering;data mining;database;cluster analysis;world wide web;satisfiability	Web+IR	-45.310774293976074	15.97046967826764	161216

With rapid advances in SOA technologies and the growing availability of web services, the problem of composing a set of web services to achieve complex systems is becoming more practical. In the context of cyber-physical systems where hardware and software are coupled together to realize integrated systems, there are special characteristics and requirements. One of these is that most service providers are physical entities with their own states and properties. The constraint that follows is that a given entity might not be able to perform all the services it can provide at the same time. In fact, “multi-threading” for physical entities is rarely possible. This requires specific service modeling techniques to enable the use of SOA methods for this domain. Another characteristic is that due to the dynamic nature of cyber-physical worlds, the service composition procedure must be dynamically adaptive. In terms of AI planning, which is one of the fundamental techniques for service composition, not only the initial state and the goal are dynamic, but the planning domain also needs to be generated dynamically to provide the complete input to the underlying planner. Taking all these characteristics and requirements into consideration, we develop an ontology model for physical entity specification. Based on this model, another widely used service ontology model, OWL-S is extended to accurately model the characteristics of service providers in the context of cyber-physical worlds. Further, a technique for generating planning domain based on task requirements is developed.	automated planning and scheduling;complex systems;cyber-physical system;entity;interoperability;multithreading (computer architecture);owl-s;planning domain definition language;relevance;requirement;semantic web;service composability principle;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;thread (computing);web service;whole earth 'lectronic link;workflow pattern	Jian Huang;Farokh B.

This brings to fore the issue of discovering an advertisement that best matches a request for a particular service---a process referred to as matchmaking. The algorithms that have thus far been proposed for matchmaking are based on comparisons of the requested and offered inputs and outputs. In this project, we extend these algorithms by taking into account the detailed process description of the service, thus leading to more accurate matchmaking.	algorithm;daml-s;matchmaking (video games);web service	Sharad Bansal;José M.

9432c69ccab12158d281f6b1c65bea3382ceddc2	dynamic description logics based semantic web services composition	action;semantic web services;dynamic description logics;services composition	The automatic Web services composition has been a research focus since an ever-increasing numbers of Web services are created and published. In this paper, we present a dynamic description logics (DDLs) based method for automatic Web services composition. DDLs are an extension of description logic with a dynamic dimension. It adds actions expressions into description logic and makes up a set of reasoning mechanism for action expressions. The DDLs reasoner has been built for DDLs formulas. As an Web service can be regarded as an action in Web, its accomplishment changes the state of Web, from original state to aim state, an Web service can be described as an action in DDLs, which this action can be described in terms of formulas in DDLs. Due to these relations between Web service and DDLs actions, our method describes both the goal service and atomic services in terms of DDLs formulas. We proved that if a goal formula can not be satisfied then the services composition can be found. The procedure of checking the satisfiability of the formula is also the procedure of discovering the services composition. Thus the problem of automatic services composition is reduced to the problem of checking the satisfiability of formulas in DDLs. An example of automatic services composition in travel area shows the effectiveness of our method.	description logic;semantic web service	Hui Peng;Limin Chen;Weizhong Zeng;Junjian Tang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23887-1_76	computer science;knowledge management;data mining;dual control theory;database	AI	-43.69403491327434	14.218623266816198	165593

Firstly, we clarify the novel WSR, named Services Network (SN), and present its concepts and components. Secondly, we outline how to build SN through Services Mining and some of the issues that should be considered. Thirdly, we evaluate how this network style registry could facilitate automated WSC.

Such environments should comply to ubiquitous or pervasive computing guidelines by sensing the user needs or wishes and offering intuitive human-computer interaction and a comfortable non-intrusive experience. To achieve this goal service orientation is widely used and tightly linked with AmI systems. Some of these employ the Web Service technology, which involves well-defined web technologies and standards that facilitate interoperable machine to machine interaction. Other systems regard services of different technologies (e.g. UPnP, OSGi etc) or generally as abstractions of various actions. Service operations are sometimes implemented as software based functions or actions over hardware equipment (e.g. UPnP players). However, a single service satisfies an atomic only user need, so services need to be composed (i.e. combined), in order to provide the usually requested complex tasks. Since manual service composition is obviously a hassle for the user, ambient systems struggle to automate this process by applying various methods. The approaches that have been adopted during the last years vary widely in many aspects, like domain of application, modeling of services, composition method, knowledge representation and interfaces. This work presents a comparative view of these approaches revealing similarities and differences, while providing additional information.	access control;algorithm;ambient intelligence;automated planning and scheduling;context awareness;converge;desktop computer;human–computer interaction;information needs;interoperability;knowledge representation and reasoning;machine to machine;matching (graph theory);multi-agent system;osgi;owl-s;ontology (information science);out of the box (feature);precondition;quality of service;service composability principle;service-orientation;smart tv;ubiquitous computing;universal plug and play;user (computing);vocabulary;web ontology language;web services description language;web service;world wide web	Thanos G.

Hence, this paper introduces Cloudle—a multi-criteria Cloud service search engine that supports matching algorithm of three kinds of requirements which are (1) functional requirement, (2) technical requirement, and (3) cost requirement. To enhance the accuracy of search results, we designed a Cloud ontology. A Cloud ontology contains a set of Cloud concepts, individuals of those concepts, and the relationship among those individuals. It is used for determining the similarity among Cloud service using three kinds of devised reasoning methods which are (1) concept similarity reasoning, (2) object property similarity reasoning, and (3) data type property similarity reasoning. Finally, the empirical results show that the result using Cloudle with the Cloud ontology has significantly better performance in finding the appropriate Cloud service than the result using Cloudle without the Cloud ontology and the result without Cloudle.	algorithm;cloud computing;functional requirement;web search engine	Jaeyong Kang;Kwang Mong Sim	2010	2010 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference	10.1109/APSCC.2010.44	computer science;data mining;database;information retrieval;search engine	DB	-45.734049226870816	13.465982705695906	167062

In recent years, Software as a Service (SaaS) model in cloud computing enriches the mobile commerce. Mobile commerce promotes the service providers building an application market platform to serve customers. However, an application market platform may collect a huge number of mobile application services (mobile Apps) and each App is usually designed with little functionality. A customer may fetch a number of Apps to mash up in order to satisfy his/her comprehensive requirements. How to mash up the Apps to provide a feature-rich composition for a customer becomes an interest research issue. In this work, we explore an approach of Apps mash-up composition in a service platform for adaptive content recommendation. A user profile conducts the service level agreements in evaluating the service quality. An Apps mash-up composition is recommended to the customer an adaptive content in a ubiquitous environment.

But when trying to find a match for a certain request it may often happen, that the request cannot be serviced by a single offer but could be handled by combining existing offers. In this case automatic service composition is needed. Although automatic composition is an active field of research it is mainly viewed as a planning problem and treated separatedly from service discovery. In this paper we argue that an integrated approach to the problem is better than seperating these issues as is usually done. We propose an approach that integrates service composition into service discovery and matchmaking to match service requests that ask for multiple connected effects, discuss general issues involved in describing and matching such services and present an efficient algorithm implementing our ideas.	algorithm;name binding;service composability principle;service discovery	Ulrich Küster;Birgitta König-Ries;Mirco Stern;Michael Klein	2007		10.1145/1242572.1242711	differentiated service;computer science;knowledge management;service delivery framework;database;service discovery;world wide web	Web+IR	-44.70738206958109	14.564320861960248	167392

To address this issue, we present an approach for compliance-aware service selection with genetic algorithms. Our approach employs the notion of compliance distance to detect and recover violations and can be integrated into existing genetic algorithms by means of a repair operation. As a proof-of-concept, we present a genetic algorithm incorporating our approach and compare it with related state-of-the-art genetic algorithms lacking this kind of check and recovery mechanism for compliance.	genetic algorithm	Fatih Karatas;Dogan Kesdogan	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-45005-1_35	quality control and genetic algorithms;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;multi-objective optimization;genetic operator;service-oriented architecture;genetic representation;data mining;management science	ECom	-46.01970770432887	15.118664094530194	169805

On the one hand, we need a mapping language to relate data structures from services definition in WSDL documents to concepts, properties and instances of a business domain. On the other hand, two functions that perform the lowering and lifting processes using these mapping specifications are also presented.	business domain;data structure;lambda lifting;semantic web service;web services description language	Miguel García Rodríguez;Jose María Álvarez Rodríguez;Diego Berrueta;Luis Polo Paredes;José Emilio Labra Gayo;Patricia Ordóñez de Pablos	2012	J.

3d25708461f11cf3ee690a8ea9b31963d36acac8	enabling rich discovery of web services by projecting weak semantics from structural specifications		Although we would prefer using defined ontologies t hat express the domains and specifications of web services, and thu s more easily discover and compose these, we know that in the mainstream world represented by the US Department of Defense we will not have those ontolo gies available soon. In the meantime we have to ensure a transition from struct u al to semantic methods, including web service discovery methods. In this pa per, we are proposing a different approach for dynamic web service discover y that takes advantage of the structure inherent in web services that are defined by WSDL documents. Since the structure is usually based on XML Schema, there is enough information present in these documents to develop a broadly applicable app ro ch. Furthermore, if a consistent and detailed naming convention of schema artifacts is followed, then discovery can be made more precise. This paper desc rib our approach for projecting weak semantics from structural informati on for discovery of web services.	ontology (information science);service discovery;struct (c programming language);web services description language;web service;xml schema	Leo Obrst;Dru McCandless;Michael Bankston	2010			web service;web standards;social semantic web;web modeling;data mining;database;devices profile for web services;ws-i basic profile;semantic web stack;ws-policy;computer science	Web+IR	-43.24991435489265	12.491835146933644	171736

Now with debut of virtual world, there come the opportunities of new types of services with which services providers and services consumers could interact in immersive services environments. Virtual services or 3D services provide new service opportunities that existing web services cannot provide. In this paper, we compare the interaction patterns for web services and virtual services.

We have designed a system for aiding users to adapt Java code in a typeand meaning-safe way, when an application has to migrate to new libraries which are not fully compatible with the legacy ones. To achieve this, we propose an approach based on an integration of the two type-theoretic notions of subtyping and type isomorphism with ontology matching. While the former notions are needed to ensure flexible adaptation in the presence of typesafety, the latter supports the user to preserve the meaning of names that appear in the program to be adapted. Intelligent agents control the different components of the system and interact with other agents in order to provide the final user with the semi-automatic porting service he/she required.	agent-based model;algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;coherence (physics);debugger;eos;intelligent agent;jade;java;library (computing);multi-agent system;name;ontology (information science);ontology alignment;ontology learning;programming language;prototype;semiconductor industry;software agent;software project management;type safety;type theory	Viviana Mascardi;Davide Ancona	2009			intelligent agent;porting;software agent;database;type safety;ontology (information science);real time java;computer science;java;agent architecture	AI	-40.989362027616345	13.439642836090082	173081

We propose the PCO data model supporting semantic inheritance to ensure the synonymy of heterogeneous semantics among distributed schemas that different authors define independently. Also, the PCO model makes semantic relationships independent of an initial class hierarchy, and enables rapid schema evolution across the Internet business. This preserves semantic interoperability without changing predefined classes. We have also encoded the PCO model into two XML-base languages: PCO Specijication Language (PSL) and Portable Composite Language (PCL). This paper demonstrates that intermediaries defining service semantics in PSL can automatically integrate multisuppliers ' PCL catalogs for their agent-mediated services.	class hierarchy;data model;distributed object;dot-com company;schema evolution;semantic interoperability;xml base	Kimio Kuramitsu;Ken Sakamura	2000		10.1109/WISE.2000.882379	e-commerce;software portability;semantic interoperability;the internet;specification language;data model;computer science;electronic data interchange;management information systems;database;distributed object;open system;semantic network;programming language;object-oriented programming;world wide web	DB	-42.23097430578096	14.371042641312448	173650

Besides functionality specification, most devices have spatial and temporal limitations. In this setting, how to organize these sensing devices properly and thus to support searching devices w.r.t the requirement of certain users is a challenge. This paper proposes a multiple index method to organize sensing devices considering their functionality specification, spatial and temporal attributes, and develops a query mechanism leveraging this multiple indexes. This technique can support the searching of sensing devices efficiently.	decision support system;real-time clock	Chu Du;Zhangbing Zhou;Lei Shu;Xiangyang Jia;Qun Wang	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.139	search engine indexing;decision support system;human–computer interaction;computer science;data mining;formal specification;database;internet of things;information retrieval	Robotics	-41.45168678552913	12.485860484008683	173835

At the same time, Semantic Web service technologies, such as the Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S), are developing the means by which services can be given richer semantic specifications. Richer semantics can enable fuller, more flexible automation of service provision and use, and support the construction of more powerful tools and methodologies. Both sets of technologies can benefit from complementary uses and crossfertilization of ideas. This paper shows how to use OWL-S in conjunction with Web service standards, and explains and illustrates the value added by the semantics expressed in OWL-S.	algorithm;business process execution language;interoperation;owl-s;precondition;semantic web service;semiconductor industry;service composability principle;web language;web ontology language;web services description language;web services discovery	David L.

The next place visited by agents, and the next service requested, is determined by both the goals of the workflow and the results of the current requests. However, the primary assumption in such workflow specifications is that the workflow designer has the ability of knowing the perfect knowledge of all the details of the process, and predicting changes of network configuration. In this paper, an efficient service recommendation strategy is suggested for migrating workflows. Services organization in our suggested strategy is based on the differential evolutionary contract net protocol. To evaluate the performance improvement achieved by our strategy, this paper uses F1 that is a well-known performance measure for recommender system. The results show that the new strategy can reduce the communication overhead and substantially improve performance in terms of global optimization and system utilization.	contract net protocol	Rui Wang;Guangzhou Zeng	2010	Expert Syst.

Unfortunately, the attribute based approach starts to show its limits when entities exhibit complex relationships, such as semantic relations, which would be easily captured using ontologies instead of attributes. This paper integrates the XACML attribute model with an OWL ontology and describes a practical privacy filtering application able to filter out information from XML documents, according to a set of XACML semantic privacy policies.	access control;entity;interoperability;ontology (information science);privacy policy;web ontology language;xacml;xml	Andrea Rota;Stuart Short;Mohammad Ashiqur Rahaman	2010		10.1145/1754239.1754245	xml catalog;xml validation;xml encryption;xml base;xml;streaming xml;computer science;document structure description;xml framework;data mining;xml database;xml schema;database;xml signature;world wide web;xml schema editor;efficient xml interchange	Web+IR	-42.411845085305366	13.270928353942171	175138

To describe situation-awareness effectively, a situation-aware interface description language (SA-IDL) which can express a collaboration system with various contexts and actions is researched. However, conflicts can occur when services expressed in SA-IDL collaborate with each other, though each service does not make any errors. This is because each service is described with requirements for each one. So, in order to provide situation-aware services without inconsistency, conflicts among services should be identified and resolved. In this paper, we propose a mathematical modeling of SA-IDL to identify the conflicts among situation-aware services, and suggest conflict resolution graph model to identify the services which occur the conflicts.

Due to many singularities of the Web service environment, such as the inherent structural and behavioral heterogeneity of Web services, in addition to their strict autonomy, it is not possible to rely on the current models and solutions to build and coordinate compositions of Web services. In this work, we present a Mediation Service layer within an architecture, named WebTransact, which provides the necessary mechanisms for homogenizing heterogeneous Web services. Such architecture separates the task of aggregating and homogenizing heterogeneous Web services from the task of specifying transaction interaction patterns, thus providing a new general mechanism to deal with the complexity introduced by a large number of Web services	service layer;web service;world wide web	Paulo F.

In particular, we solve the following problem: given the formal specification of the (incomplete) system, say p already built, what is a characterization of the sub-systems that can collaborate with p, through a given communication interfaceL , so that the complete system satisfies a given property φ? An automatic procedure is defined to identify the formulaψ such that, for each process q satisfyingψ, the parallel composition of p andq through L satisfiesφ. For applicability of the method to web service compositions the formula ψ should specify, as much as possible, only the communication actions that allow p to correctly fulfill φ.	formal specification;web service	Antonella Santone;Gigliola Vaglini;Maria Luisa Villani	2009			computer science;database;multimedia;world wide web	DB	-45.30197489255886	18.022361292209503	176767
0adbcdeb3d4d974663cc1569a50d6be62c4c527d	mmdes: multimedia digital ecosystem - new platform for collaboration and sharing		Currently multimedia contents dominate the information exchanged in Internet, particularly through social networks. Each actor on the Internet becomes producer and consumer of contents. Nevertheless, social network and other traditional collaborative environments present limitations regarding content selection, categorization, aggregation, linking and interoperability, and usage control and privacy. In [1], we proposed the architecture (based on a peer-to-peer infrastructure and Semantic Web) of a MultiMedia Digital EcoSystem (MMDES), as a new environment for collaboration and sharing of multimedia resources, multimedia processings, as well as for computing and storage capabilities. In this paper, we describe functionalities related to managing the collective knowledge and equilibrium in MMDES. We also describe the implementation of MMDES using a mobile platform in order to provide resources' sharing for the Archivo Nacional de Arte Rupestre (ANAR) in Venezuela.	.net framework;application domain;categorization;digital ecosystem;high- and low-level;internet;interoperability;mobile operating system;national library of paraguay;peer-to-peer;semantic web;social network	Solomon Asres Kidanu;Yudith Cardinale;Richard Chbeir;Victor De Ponte;Alejandro Figueroa;Ronier Rodriguez;Carlos Arturo Raymundo Ibañez	2016	2016 IEEE Intl Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE Intl Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC) and 15th Intl Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications for Business Engineering (DCABES)	10.1109/CSE-EUC-DCABES.2016.214	computer network;architecture;interoperability;the internet;ontology (information science);categorization;digital ecosystem;semantic web;social network;multimedia;computer science;knowledge management	DB	-46.25362753854393	11.338902921776238	177161

Usually, a business application cannot be fulfilled by one Web service but by coordinating a set of them. In particular, to perform a coordination, one of the important investigations is the compatibility analysis. Two Web services are said compatible if they can interact correctly. In the literature, the proposed frameworks for the services compatibility checking rely on the supported sequences of messages. The interaction of services depends also on other properties, such that the exchanged data flow. Thus, considering only supported sequences of messages seems to be insufficient. Other properties on which the services interaction can rely on, are the temporal constraints. In this paper, we focus our interest on the compatibility analysis of Web services regarding their (1) supported sequences of messages, (2) the exchanged data flow, (3) constraints related to the exchanged data flow and (4) the temporal requirements. Based on these properties, we study three compatibility classes: (i) absolute compatibility, (ii) likely compatibility and (iii) absolute incompatibility.	business software;dataflow;requirement;software incompatibility;web service	Nawal Guermouche;Olivier Perrin;Christophe Ringeissen	2008	Electr.

However, since they are currently described syntactically using XML standards, i.e., SOAP, WSDL and UDDI, the automation of web services tasks, e.g., web service discovery, selection, composition and execution, is still a challenge. In order to make the most of automation in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), the concept of the semantic web services (SWS), which are described semantically using an ontology language, have been introduced. The research related to testing and quality assurance aspects of web services is not mature~\cite{Tsai2008}. This is especially true for semantic web services, since research to-date has mainly focused the automation of WS tasks. Furthermore, some semantic web service frameworks promote the client-oriented SOA, by formally specifying user requirements, called ``goal specification'', and automatically resolve it by appropriate web service detection. Keeping this in mind, we propose a novel approach for testing semantic web services based on user goal specifications. We believe this type of testing would add real value to web service users, unlike tradition web service testing.	component-based software engineering;formal specification;mathematical optimization;ontology (information science);requirement;soap;semantic web service;service discovery;service-oriented architecture;sinewave synthesis;user requirements document;web services description language;web services discovery;xml	M.

With services being invoked in composition with each other, computing the trust of the composition and selecting services that deliver the highest trust for it becomes a desired goal. In this paper we demonstrate how using Bayesian networks and its supporting queries, we can select the set of services among all candidates that would provide highest global trust.	algorithm;bayesian network;computation;experiment;inference engine;network model;service composability principle;test case;web service	Mohammad-Reza Motallebi;Fuyuki Ishikawa;Shinichi Honiden	2012	2012 IEEE 19th International Conference on Web Services	10.1109/ICWS.2012.100	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;law;world wide web;approximation algorithm	Robotics	-44.276016500425506	16.304491680717906	178411

It is able to take advantage of old users experience as WS quality information to provide other users better trustworthy and more appropriate WS via an independent XML file which contains not only the initial WSDL published by the service provider but also the quality of service (QoS) information of the WS come from widely users' experience. A recommendation module is also presented that delivers the WS that maximizes the value of QoS characteristics among others with the same functionality or name.

The discussion addresses how a simple design evolves into more sophisticated versions through local adaptations and improvements.

Composing existing services into large functional units will bring added values for organizations. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the Internet, building a framework for service composition and execution must provide a mechanism to design and execute service composition in a very flexible and efficient way. To build such a framework, some basic issues related to services must be put into consideration. These issues include service description, service registration, service discovery, service matching and so on. To resolve those problems in an automatic or semiautomatic way, semantic knowledge is the key. ASCEND is a framework to provide a resolution for service composition and execution automatically and dynamically. In ASCEND, we combine ontology with service registration so that the automatic service discovery and service matching can be realized based on ontology inference.	ascend;internet;service composability principle;service discovery;web service	Shuiguang Deng;Zhaohui Wu;Ying Li	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

It presents a distributed resource allocation process which combines the benefits of semantic web for making easier the integration between multiple resource providers in the Cloud and agent technologies for coordinating and adapting the execution accross the different providers. The allocation process is based on the negotiation of different agents which allows the combination of customer and providers policies getting scheduling results which satisfies both parts. The SERA agents can be deployed in multiple locations improving the system scalability. The new approach makes the SERA suitable for working as a scheduler inside a Service Provider as well as a metascheduler integrating resources from different providers and platforms (clusters, grids, clouds,...).	meta-scheduling;multi-agent system;scalability;scheduling (computing);semantic web;software agent	Jorge Ejarque;Raúl Sirvent;Rosa M.

Researchers can often benefit from access to real-world data sets against which to evaluate new approaches and algorithms. Whilst more than a dozen data sets are currently publicly available, their use of heterogeneous mark-up impedes easy and widespread use. We describe VT — the Perceiver and semantic Interpreter — which offers a workbench API for the querying, re-structuring and re-purposing of a range of diverse data formats currently in use. The use of a single API reduces cognitive overload, improves access, and supports integration of generic and domain-specific information within a common framework.	algorithm;application programming interface;artificial intelligence;documentation;download;home automation;human–computer interaction;pervasive informatics;real-time clock;semantic interpretation;sensor;smart environment;web ontology language;while;workbench	Juan Ye;Graeme Stevenson;Simon A.

In this framework, any grievance process primarily involves negotiation (with or without mediation) and arbitration or a combination of both. In this way, the result of a conflict resolution can be an agreement among the conflicting parties by which they voluntary settle the conflict, or a decision from the arbitrator (a neutral third party) which is final, and binding on both conflicting parties. The framework is designed in such a way that multiple agreement mechanisms may be available at any given time, to be activated and adjusted on demand (on-line) by participating agents. The framework is also generic enough so that new protocols may be easily added. The objective is to have a generic electronic institution that may be tailored to specific needs and grafted into other electronic institutions.	agent-based model;multi-agent system;online and offline	Adriana Giret;Pablo Noriega	2011	2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2011.322	conflict resolution research;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;operations management;multi-agent system;computer security	SE	-41.28205435996094	16.74196435479038	182246

Because of distributed responsibilities, ownership and control, it is often not feasible to acquire all information needed for the service composition. These characteristics of autonomy and heterogeneity are fundamental to service oriented computing but make it inherently difficult to avoid service conflicts. To reason about and adapt to a changing environment, in this work, we extend current OWL-S by introducing the concept of service assumptions which allow reasoning with incomplete information. Furthermore, together with the proposed service assumptions, a sequence of rules is proposed to describe all permitted behaviors in service composition context	autonomous robot;default logic;emoticon;knowledge-based systems;model checking;owl-s;precondition;semantic web service;service composability principle;service-oriented architecture;software agent	Zheng Lu;Shiyan Li;Aditya K.

However, as Cloud-based web services (CWSs) proliferate, it becomes difficult to facilitate service composition quickly in Cloud computing environment. In this paper, based on the notion of Skyline, we propose a fast CWS composition approach. This approach adopts Skyline operator to prune redundant CWS candidates and then employs Particle Swarm Optimization to select CWS from amount of candidates for composing single service into a more powerful composite service. Based on a real dataset, we conduct an experiment to evaluate our proposed approach. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is effective and efficient for CWS composition.	chrome web store;cloud computing;particle swarm optimization;seamless3d;service composability principle;service-oriented modeling;skyline operator;web service	Shangguang Wang;Qibo Sun;Hua Zou;Fangchun Yang	2013	MONET	10.1007/s11036-012-0373-3	cloud computing;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;particle swarm optimization;world wide web	Web+IR	-45.845928747338625	15.262317451999387	184279

This is even more the case when developing service centric systems in which software systems are constructed based on the identification and composition of Web services that together can fulfil the functionality of the system being developed. In this paper we present a framework that supports the discovery of services that can provide the functionality and satisfy the properties and constraints of service-based systems during their design phase. Our framework makes use of linear composition of service operations in which more than one Web service operations can be combined to fulfil a functionality of the system when no single operation can be identified. The discovery process is based on a graph-matching algorithm. A prototype tool has been developed to demonstrate and evaluate the framework.	algorithm;linear logic;matching (graph theory);prototype;service discovery;service-oriented architecture;software system;web service	Andrea Zisman;Khaled Mahbub;George Spanoudakis	2007	IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2007)	10.1109/SCC.2007.15	computer science;service delivery framework;data mining;database;service discovery;world wide web	Robotics	-46.2979457541742	16.713415728691313	184411

Firstly, the service should recognize the current situation. Secondly, the characteristics of user should be considered. As the condition of a service execution depends on the user's trait, the same service should be performed differently according to the served user. Lastly, the conflict among the performed services should be resolved. When the desires, which have the exclusive relations, exist at the same time, the conflict can be happened. In this paper, we propose a model for service selection.

90254e371d628ace2b72de2bbb3f57a9cf0ce0e4	cloud services discovery and selection: survey and new semantic-based system		With the proliferation of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) in the cloud environment, it is difficult for users to search for the right service that satisfies all their needs. In addition, services may provide the same functionality but differ in their characteristics or Quality of Service attributes (QoS). In this chapter, we present a comprehensive survey on cloud services discovery and selection research approaches. Based on this survey, a complete system with efficient service description model, discovery, and selection mechanisms is urgently required. Therefore, we propose a semantic-based SaaS publication, discovery, and selection system, which assists the user in finding and choosing the best SaaS service that meets his functional and non-functional requirements. The basic building block of the proposed system is the unified ontology, which combines services domain knowledge, SaaS characteristics, QoS metrics, and real SaaS offers. A hybrid service matchmaking algorithm is introduced based on the proposed unified ontology. It integrates semantic-based meta data and ontology-based matching. Ontology-based matching integrates distance-based and content-based concept similarity measures. The matchmaking algorithm is used in clustering the SaaS offers into functional groups to speed up the matching process. In the selection process, the discovered services are filtered based on their characteristics, and then they are ranked based on their QoS attributes. Case studies, prototypical implementation results, and evaluation are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system		Yasmine M. Afify;Ibrahim F. Moawad;Nagwa Lotfy Badr;Mohamed F.

To select qualified services and compose them into a service composition framework manually is time-consuming and error-prone. In practice, it is a challenging endeavor to timely discover qualified services and develop a service composition schema. In view of this challenge, a workflow framework is presented in this paper for intelligently navigating service composition. The workflow framework consists of two primary processing modules: Planning Module and CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) Solving Module. Planning Module aims at producing composite plans taking advantage of services’ functional attributes. Moreover, CSP Solving Module aims at selecting an appropriate service, taking advantaging of services’ non-functional attributes, from a group of qualified services that own the same functionality. This group of qualified services is instantiated from a service class predefined. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the framework.	cognitive dimensions of notations;communicating sequential processes;constraint satisfaction;ibm notes;real life;service composability principle	Xudong Song;Wan-Chun Dou;Wei Song	2009	2009 Workshops at the Grid and Pervasive Computing Conference	10.1109/GPC.2009.28	quality of service;computer science;knowledge management;service delivery framework;database;services computing;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network	AI	-44.89368606224973	14.932415151044612	186462

One of the most critical aspects in enterprise information systems is to maintain their continuous operation as long as possible. Conventional service invocation mechanism identifies Web services with similar signatures found by a service discovery as distinctively different ones, resulting in the suspension of a service requester and the modification of its invocation procedures. In this paper, we propose a reasonable solution to realize runtime invocation of Web services, regarding structural similarities in service signatures as subsumption relations of XML scheme. Given Web services with subsumed signatures, this solution enables a service requester to invoke the Web services by translating the scheme types of the invocation parameters.	antivirus software;continuous operation;enterprise information system;service discovery;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;subsumption architecture;web service;xml	Shinichi Nagano;Tetsuo Hasegawa;Akihiko Ohsuga;Shinichi Honiden	2004	Proceedings.

Many approaches are using keyword based syntactic methods and recent approaches are using semantic web technology to enhance service discovery. Traditional service discovery mechanism acts like a black box which processes input and gives output. Results of service discovery are not based on current situations. Real world is event driven and situations keep on changing in a dynamic manner. Situations affect service providers and service requesters. Hence, service discovery results should be situation aware. By introducing situation awareness (dynamic context) in service discovery, one can get relevant results. There is a need to maintain dynamically changing context of various services. This work proposes service discovery algorithm, which is based on rule engine. Implemented algorithm gives higher recall value and situation aware results while discovering services.	algorithm;black box;business rules engine;postcondition;precondition;provisioning;semantic web;semantic reasoner;service discovery;syntactic methods	Pankesh Patel;Sanjay Chaudhary	2009	2009 World Conference on Services - II	10.1109/SERVICES-2.2009.19	differentiated service;computer science;service delivery framework;service design;database;service discovery;world wide web;information retrieval	HPC	-44.00305838269638	14.239674895602693	187079

In these, resources are key actors in the interfaces, in contrast to other approaches where services, messages or objects are. This distinctive feature necessitates a new approach for modelling RESTful interfaces providing a more intuitive mapping from model to implementation than could be achieved with non-resource methods. With this objective we propose an approach to describe Resource Oriented and RESTful Web Services based on UML collaboration diagrams. Then use it to model scenarios from several problem domains, arguing that Resource Oriented and RESTful Web Services can be used in systems which go beyond ad-hoc integration. Using the scenarios we demonstrate how the approach is useful for: eliciting domain ontologies; identifying recurring patterns; and capturing static and dynamic aspects of the interface.	diagram;hoc (programming language);ontology (information science);problem domain;representational state transfer;unified modeling language;web service;world wide web	Areeb Alowisheq;David E.

Such service setting is ideal for wireless/mobile computing, where user terminals are not necessarily online during their entire session. To improve the capabilities of service registries met in the Web services reference architecture, we exploit the advantages of the semantic Web framework.

To improve the automation of Web services interoperation, a lot of technologies are recommended, such as semantic Web services and agents. In this paper an approach for semantic Web service discovery and propagation based on semantic Web services and FIPA multi agents is proposed. A broker allowing to expose semantic interoperability between semantic Web service provider and agent by translating WSDL to DF description for semantic Web services and vice versa is proposed. We describe how the proposed architecture analyzes the request and after being analyzed, matches or publishes the request. The ontology management in the broker creates the user ontology and merges it with general ontology (i.e. WordNet, Yago, Wikipedia …). We also describe the recommender which analyzes the created WSDL based on the functional and non-functional requirements and then recommends it to Web service provider to increase their retrieval probability in the related queries.	functional requirement;interoperation;non-functional requirement;ontology (information science);recommender system;semantic web service;semantic interoperability;service discovery;software propagation;system integration;web services description language;wikipedia;wordnet;yago	Azadeh Ghari Neiat;Mehran Mohsenzadeh;Sajjad Haj Shavalady;Amir Masoud Rahmani	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Networking and Services	10.1109/ICNS.2009.87	web service;semantic computing;web development;web modeling;semantic web rule language;data web;semantic search;semantic grid;web standards;computer science;software agent;ws-policy;semantic web;social semantic web;multi-agent system;web page;semantic web stack;database;web intelligence;ws-i basic profile;web 2.0;world wide web;owl-s;information retrieval;universal description discovery and integration;semantic analytics	Web+IR	-43.87761977890026	12.941849966733523	189529

A reliable e-commerce system must have the capability in handling a large quantity of heterogeneous information without a centralized control. Normally, agents are required in this type of e-commerce system. This paper presents a Java-based dynamic multi-agent infrastructure for e-commerce automation. The independent agents, who can switch roles, participate in multiple problem solving domains and form dynamic partnerships, cooperate with each other by exchanging data with particular protocol in the domain ontology. The key issues in this system include the communication protocol, the mechanisms for agents to exchange ontologies and interpret the messages. XML is used as the protocol in the proposed system due to it flexibility and compatibility. This work focuses on providing a multi-agent cooperation infrastructure to achieve e-commerce automation.

It aims at selecting and inter-connecting services provided by different partners in response to client requests. Planning techniques are used widely in the literature to describe Web services composition problem. However, since Web services proliferate day after day, classical planners are no longer well suited to compose Web services in a reasonable time. This weakness is due to the explosion of the search space caused by the large number of services and the broad range of data exchanged among services. In this paper, we propose a decentralised multi-agent approach to solve the Web services composition problem at runtime. Our model consists of a set of Web service agents where each agent has a set of services organised in a graph. Responding to a request, agents propose partial plans which are partial paths in the graph, then they coordinate their partial plans to provide the best global plan for the submitted request. The analysis of the complexity and results of the implementation show the ability of our approach to scale up when compared to the of state-of-the-art techniques for automated web service composition.	multi-agent system;run time (program lifecycle phase);service composability principle;web service	Mohamad El Falou;Maroua Bouzid;Abdel-Illah Mouaddib;Thierry Vidal	2009	2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.68	web service;web modeling;business process execution language;web analytics;web standards;computer science;ws-policy;service-oriented architecture;data mining;ws-addressing;database;services computing;ws-i basic profile;law;world wide web;intelligent agent	AI	-43.92912445961399	13.261007231860097	191076

Though the interoperability between diverse applications via using Web service is mentioned in different solutions, there are still a lot of challenges in this area, one of which is how to satisfy overall QoS constraints when composite Web service. Semantic Web service provides a feasible semantic annotation of QoS attributes. However, how to capture this feature and enable dynamic decision is critical in achieving efficient QoS aware Web service composition. In this paper, based on semantic Web extension, pragmatic Web, we propose pragmatic agent based QoS aware Web service composition architecture. The detail structure and design process is elaborated and it is argued that this approach provide a new perspective on Web service composition.	agent-based model;interoperability;pragmatic web;quality of service;semantic web service;service composability principle	Wenge Rong;Lin Liang;Kecheng Liu	2007	Third International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grid (SKG 2007)	10.1109/SKG.2007.129	web service;web application security;web development;web modeling;data web;web design;web standards;computer science;artificial intelligence;computational linguistics;ws-policy;web navigation;social semantic web;data mining;semantic web stack;database;web intelligence;web engineering;ws-i basic profile;law;world wide web;mashup	Web+IR	-45.241928547620695	14.50898146828284	191974

It’s crucial to the automation and intelligence of service invocation, achieving better user-experience of QoS. However, key-word based syntactic matchmaker currently fails to provide a satisfied service discovery mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a RS-CASD (Rough Set-based Context-Aware Service Discovery) Framework that explores context information and ontology model to semantically enhance the user query and service advertisement for more fulfilled service discovery. Rough set theory is applied to deal with inexact or uncertain functional and contextual properties and extraction of context rules from historical records.	experiment;rough set;rule induction;scalability;service discovery;service-oriented architecture;set theory;sorting;usability	Lian Yu;Shan Luo;Arne J.

In general, applications in this area re implemented in an ad hoc fashion without an explicit design at a conceptual level, and without taking into account the dynamic requirements imposed by the domain of application and the maintenance problem (including desired extension or modification of functionality) implied by this dynamic character.	agent architecture;e-commerce;hoc (programming language);requirement;world wide web	Catholijn M.

However, the organizations involved may hold different types of evaluation scores, e.g., crisp number, value range and fuzzy linguistic terms. Besides, for the scores of fuzzy linguistic terms, different organizations may hold various evaluation granularities to meet their personalized preferences, which further increase the difficulties for unified service evaluation. So it is a great challenge to take these aspects into consideration for cross-organizational service selection. In view of this challenge, a comprehensive evaluation method named CRML (Crisp number-value Range-Multiple granularities Linguistic terms, CRML) is put forward in this paper. First, the scores of various evaluation types are unified into a form of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Second, a classic TOPSIS method is employed to rank all the candidate services for cross-organizational service selection. Finally, a case study is brought forth to validate the feasibility of our proposal.	personalization;service-oriented infrastructure	Rutao Yang;Lianyong Qi;Wenmin Lin;Wan-Chun Dou;Jinjun Chen	2010	2010 13th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2010.54	web service;quality of service;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;computational linguistics;data mining;database;law;pragmatics	DB	-46.23238857534088	13.263473691801153	194286

Although context-aware services are expected in the forthcoming ubiquitous computing era, conventional service coordination techniques are insufficient because of rigid interface designing. To cope with this problem, we have established a flexible service composition framework, where a semantic-level service scenario is translated and its components are dynamically found, selected, and bound. User situations change with time, so service components should be changed in accordance with context change. We propose a new method that reselects and rebinds service components based on context change. Through a performance measurement, we show the effectiveness and practicality of the new method.	context-aware network;mobile phone;performance;semantic web;server (computing);service composability principle;ubiquitous computing	Yoji Yamato;Hiroshi Sunaga	2007	IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2007)	10.1109/ICWS.2007.67	web service;differentiated service;computer science;interface design;semantic web;database;multimedia;data as a service;world wide web;ubiquitous computing;measurement	SE	-44.62465025658695	13.284187214667753	195419

This framework is composed of four Multi-Agent Systems (MAS, Connection MAS, Communication MAS, Information MAS and Adaptation MAS) for handling adaptation. In this paper, we illustrate how the PUMAS agents augment user queries with information about her/his characteristics and those of her/his MD and, how the Router Agent (which belongs to the Information MAS) redirects the user queries towards the different Web based Information System (WIS) which contain all or part of the information for answering them and which execute on servers or MDs.	agent communications language;algorithm;information retrieval;information system;jade;knowledge management;router (computing);routing;user profile;world wide web	Angela Carrillo Ramos;Marlène Villanova-Oliver;Jérôme Gensel;Hervé Martin	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-74063-6_7	knowledge base;query expansion;computer science;knowledge management;multi-agent system;personal information management;mobile device;database;structure of management information;information retrieval;query language;human–computer information retrieval	Web+IR	-43.392629483014886	11.441330246011493	195671

Web service still brings less than expected benefits to small corporations and end-users for two reasons: 1) the web service only focuses on data level and is difficult to implement the presentation-centric business contexts. 2) The small corporations and end-users usually do not have enough IT competences to write a client or user interface to interact with web service(s). In order to solve these problems, the author proposes a presentation-preserved compositional approach for service-oriented architecture (PCSOA), which extends the existing data-oriented compositional approaches for web services to provide a more flexible methodology to orchestrate both data level and presentation level services during the workflow integration. A prototype is also built to validate the feasibility of the approach.

To improve the result of such QA process, we introduced a concept of QA social networks - a mechanism to share QA policies among trustworthy entities to reinforce the number of QA policies applied during the QA process in the WQA model. In this paper, we detail the trust model underpinning the QA social network, i.e. what we mean under """"trusting another entity"""" and how trust can be expressed and persisted; we propose a scalable and robust trust algorithm GriTa capable of deriving trust between arbitrary two entities in the QA social network.

When multiple services provide the same or similar functionalities, selecting those that satisfy users' non-functional requirements is crucial. In many cases, non-functional properties of services are heavily dependent on the activity of the network delivering those services whilst the network activity follows certain time-sensitive rules. We present a service selection algorithm that takes into account time-sensitive variations of non-functional propensities of services to identify a service combination offering the highest quality within a specified time interval.	functional requirement;non-functional requirement;selection algorithm;service composability principle;while	Lei Xu;Lei Shi;Runxin Wang;Brendan Jennings	2011	12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops	10.1109/INM.2011.5990664	service provider;web service;lead;quality of service;computer science;service delivery framework;data mining;database;law;world wide web;non-functional requirement;satisfiability	Networks	-45.76615511551563	16.037345260503866	199038

We formalise the WS functional, QoS and transactional properties as well as the WS Composition problem. We have extended Coloured Petri Net (CPN) formalism to incorporate transactional WSs properties in the composition process. We present and prove our CPN Transactional WS (CPN-TWS) selection algorithm that satisfies the user query functional conditions expressed as input and output attributes, QoS requirements represented by weights over criteria, and transactional properties expressed as a risk level. The result of our algorithm is a CPN corresponding to a Transactional Composite WS whose WS components locally optimise the QoS. We present experimental results to study the performance and the efficiency of our selection algorithm compared with an exhaustive one.	ambiguous name resolution;best-first search;cpn-ami;coloured petri net;control flow;ibm tivoli workload scheduler;input/output;quality of service;requirement;selection algorithm;semantics (computer science);tuple space;unfolding (dsp implementation);user requirements document;web service	Yudith Cardinale;Joyce El Haddad;Maude Manouvrier;Marta Rukoz	2011	IJWGS	10.1504/IJWGS.2011.038389	quality of service;computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;law;world wide web;computer network	PL	-46.285256299492225	16.383998972712213	199808
