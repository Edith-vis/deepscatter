Software packages transparently exchange their data and results. Different vendor's hardware platforms read and write each other's files without a hitch. And the skies are not cloudy all day.This paper discusses software developed by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) to deal with the real world of differing image file formats, mismatched byte orders and word sizes, and confusing hardcopy device interfaces.	byte;image file formats;san diego supercomputer center	David R.

Our approach is to exploit the spatial and temporal nature of data and queries such as motion characteristics. In this article, we discuss four major themes and projects of the group: (i) nearest neighbor queries, (ii) temporal data processing and continuous queries, (iii) P2P spatial data management, and (iv) location privacy. The group is supported by funding from the Australian Research Council and the National ICT Australia Victoria Research Laboratory.	distributed computing;peer-to-peer;spatial analysis;spatiotemporal database;temporal database;the australian;victoria (3d figure)	Egemen Tanin;Rui Zhang;Lars Kulik	2009	SIGMOD Record	10.1145/1815933.1815942	computer science;information security;peer-to-peer;data mining;database;spatial analysis;temporal database;privacy;world wide web;spatial query	DB	-43.07183287496354	-7.546571368357717	194370

From the beginning the PANGAEA group started initiatives and aimed at an organisation structure which – beyond the technical structure and operation of the system – would help to improve the quality and general availability of scientific data. Project data management is done since 1996. 2001 the ICSU World Data Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (WDC-MARE) was founded and since 2003 – together with other German WDC – the group was working on the development of data publications as a new publication type. To achieve interoperability with other data centers and portals the system was adapted to global information standards. PANGAEA R © has implemented a number of community specific data portals. 2007 – under the coordination of the PANGAEA R © group – an initiative for networking all WDC was started. On the long range ISCU supports plans to develop the WDC system into a global network of publishers and open access libraries for scientific	archive;data center;global network;interoperability;library (computing);library classification;pangaea (data library);persistent identifier;portals;scientific literature;software release life cycle;wdc 65c21	Michael Diepenbroek;Uwe Schindler;Hannes Grobe	2008			data center;digital library;computer science;law;world wide web	HPC	-41.46039991867441	-4.279697285903583	198389

The MDC system is implemented in Java language. It aims at providing important tools to support a distributed interactive education environment. The system consists of a classroom manager and some powerful teaching application tools. The classroom manager is a sharing system with a database. The teaching application tools include Multimedia Internet Browser, Shared White Board, Multi-Channel Audio Conference, WWWBased Note-Taking System, and Instruction Evaluation System. The MDC system and these application tools have been implemented and tested on the heterogeneous environment where workstations and PCs are connected through networks.	algorithm;browsing;database;java;workstation	Yosihisa Udagawa	1991		10.1109/ICDE.1991.131454	relational model;entity–relationship model;relational database;computer science;theoretical computer science;database model;data integrity;data mining;database;programming language;database design	HPC	-42.88251276140217	-5.263994946183229	198877
