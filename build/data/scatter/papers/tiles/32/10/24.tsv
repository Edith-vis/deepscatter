569b7fd0f5c34a3f0465e0e5477af4b724411064	circle of health based access control for personal health information systems		Patients can track, manage, and share their personal health information (PHI). There are security concerns with the ownership and custodianship of PHI. Traditional provider-facing access control (AC) policies have been applied to many patient-facing applications without consideration as to whether these controls are comprehensible and sufficient. We have conducted a scoping literature review of on AC and patient privacy (n = 31) to identify the state of knowledge and to understand what is being done to address this gap. Synthesizing the results we propose Circle of Health Based AC, a graphical patient-centric AC model. The model has been validated with a panel of user experience, healthcare, and security experts. This work will discuss the scoping literature review and describe the proposed model and justification for it’s applications for user-defined access policy.	access control;information systems	Ryan Habibi;Jens H.

233b93a013cf18c3411ba4ea1bdebf59c0ec7e22	access control enforcement delegation for information-centric networking architectures	privacy preservation;access control policies;stakeholder interoperability	Information is the building block of Information Centric Networks (ICNs). Access control policies limit information dissemination to authorized entities only. Defining access control policies in an ICN is a non-trivial task as an information item may exist in multiple copies dispersed in various network locations, including caches and content replication servers. In this paper we propose an access control enforcement delegation scheme which enables the purveyor of an information item to evaluate a request against an access control policy, without having access to the requestor credentials nor to the actual definition of the policy. Such an approach has multiple merits: it enables the interoperability of various stakeholders, it protects user identity and it can set the basis for a privacy preserving mechanism. An implementation of our scheme supports its feasibility.	access control;apple icon image format;authorization;credential;entity;icn gps;interoperability	Nikos Fotiou;Giannis F. Marias;George C.

By integrating mobile computing and cloud computing, mobile cloud computing (MCC) greatly extends the boundary of the mobile applications, but it also inherits many challenges in cloud computing, e.g., data privacy and data integrity. In this paper, we leverage several cryptographic primitives such as a new type-based proxy re-encryption to design a secure and efficient data distribution system in MCC, which provides data privacy, data integrity, data authentication, and flexible data distribution with access control. Compared to traditional cloud-based data storage systems, our system is a lightweight and easily deployable solution for mobile users in MCC since no trusted third parties are involved and each mobile user only has to keep short secret keys consisting of three group elements for all cryptographic operations. Finally, we present extensive performance analysis and empirical studies to demonstrate the security, scalability, and efficiency of our proposed system.	access control;computation;computer data storage;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;data integrity;dynamic data;encryption;information privacy;merkle tree;message authentication;mobile app;mobile cloud computing;mobile computing;mobile device;profiling (computer programming);provable security;proxy re-encryption;scalability;smartphone;tcl;trusted third party;upload	Jiang Zhang;Zhenfeng Zhang;Hui Guo	2017	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2017.2687931	mobile database;mobile search;computer network;cloud computing;mobile technology;mobile cloud computing;mobile computing;mobile web;cloud computing security;distributed computing;computer science	Mobile	-42.61650491931511	67.13641929407824	176908

The efficiency and effectiveness of such smart grids rely on customer consumption data that is collected, processed, and analyzed. This data is used for billing, monitoring, and prediction. However, this implies privacy threats. Approaches exist that aim to either encrypt data in certain ways, to reduce the resolution of data or to mask data in a way so that an individuals’ contribution is untraceable. While the latter is an effective way for protecting customer privacy when aggregating over space or time, one of the drawbacks of these approaches is the limitation or full negligence of device failures. In this paper, we therefore propose a masking approach for spatio-temporal aggregation of time series for protecting individual privacy while still providing sufficient error-resilience and reliability.	algorithm;computation;consumer privacy;correctness (computer science);data aggregation;electronic billing;electronic signature;encryption;fault tolerance;requirement;smart meter;software deployment;time complexity;time series	Fabian Knirsch;Günther Eibl;Dominik Engel	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2630803	privacy software;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	DB	-44.89001700622307	66.55517278865373	177268

Today society and market requires a way to identify users univocally and secured, especially in online and remote environments. The ID fraud has increased in the last years. Additionally, European Union presents a unique situation: several member states, several ways to identify people and moreover the citizens can move from one member state (MS) to other with those identification means. These leads to a complex situation where forgeries, fraud and theft are quite common. EKSISTENZ project is a European founded project which will try to deal with this situation and propose some tools to make the European Union citizen identities stronger. In this paper we present this project, introducing the situation, the existing vulnerabilities in the identification/recognition process and how the tools EKSISTENZ pretends to develop will overcome them.	align (company);biometrics;centralized computing;click fraud;cryptography;process (computing)	Judith Liu-Jimenez;Raul Sánchez-Reillo;Ramón Blanco-Gonzalo;Belen Fernandez-Saavedra	2015	2015 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)	10.1109/CCST.2015.7389706	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	EDA	-46.927846633743776	63.827896344578704	177294

In this direction, one of the main concerns is to protect the sensitive personal information, while at the same time avoid delays in the provision of services like healthcare to the general public. An extension of TCP, the Tcpcrypt, is a promising technology that can be used on this field. Tcpcrypt is designed to provide end-to-end encryption in the transport layer with low overhead, rendering it a very promising solution in order to protect medical data that are often handled by devices with limited resources. In this paper Tcpcrypt performance is evaluated against TCP, in terms of additional overhead incurred in the total size of the transmitted data and the total number of CPU instructions that are executed. Moreover, a solution for reducing overhead through fine-grained packet handling is proposed. © 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.	tcpcrypt	Stefanos A.

Meanwhile, for security reasons, those companies and organizations would like to verify the integrity of their data once storing it in the cloud. To address this issue, they need a proper cloud storage auditing scheme which matches their actual demands. Current research often focuses on the situation where the data manager owns the data; however, the data belongs to the company, rather than the data managers in the real situation which has been overlooked. For example, the current data manager is no longer suitable to manage the data stored in the cloud after a period and will be replaced by another one. The successor needs to verify the integrity of the former managed data; this problem is obviously inevitable in reality. In this paper, we fill this gap by giving a practical efficient revocable privacy-preserving public auditing scheme for cloud storage meeting the auditing requirement of large companies and organization’s data transfer. The scheme is conceptually simple and is proven to be secure even when the cloud service provider conspires with revoked users.	big data;cloud computing;cloud storage;computer data storage;extensibility	Xinpeng Zhang;Chunxiang Xu;Xiaojun Zhang;Taizong Gu;Zhi Geng;Guoping Liu	2016	Information	10.3390/info7020031	computer science;database;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-42.70961068026984	67.29556293366517	178215
c9e0ea421107f542bde506ec4d15e03e91c676a7	providing efficient user management for large-scale enterprise by achieving high scalability over cloud		Cloud computing is an emerging computing technology, almost used by all the big enterprises to store and access their private organisational data. It also helps to manage the complex work and to process in easy and secure manner. Access control models provide authorisation and authentication to the users in pursuance of providing security over the data in the cloud. Big enterprises prefer role-based access control (RBAC) model to manage the different roles in the management. A drastic problem called u0027role explosionu0027 occurs in RBAC due to the random increase in the number of users and roles in an organisation. In this paper, we propose a variant data structure model for the role-based access control model namely scalable bloom filter-role-based access control (SBF-RBAC) model. Our proposed model implements scalable bloom filters for each role so that there could be a dynamic accommodation of users in the roles that reduce space complexity.	scalability	G.

In this paper, we provide privacy-enhancing methods for creating k-anonymous tables in a distributed scenario. Specifically, we consider a setting in which there is a set of customers, each of whom has a row of a table, and a miner, who wants to mine the entire table. Our objective is to design protocols that allow the miner to obtain a k-anonymous table representing the customer data, in such a way that does not reveal any extra information that can be used to link sensitive attributes to corresponding identifiers, and without requiring a central authority who has access to all the original data. We give two different formulations of this problem, with provably private solutions. Our solutions enhance the privacy of k-anonymization in the distributed scenario by maintaining end-to-end privacy from the original customer data to the final k-anonymous results.	data anonymization;end-to-end encryption;identifier;privacy	Sheng Zhong;Zhiqiang Yang;Rebecca N.

3ff9d97689439d472047945804a8a6675a1a4959	some basics on privacy techniques, anonymization and their big data challenges		With the progress in the information and communication fields, new opportunities and technologies for statistical analysis, knowledge discovery, data mining, and many other research areas have emerged, together with new challenges for privacy and data protection. Nowadays several personal records are kept in computerized databases. Personal data is collected and kept in census databases, medical databases, employee databases, among others. There has always been an asymmetry between the benefits of computerized databases and the rights of individual data subjects. Some data protection principles can be derived from the legal framework. In this survey, we present some basic cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques that may be used for enhancing privacy, we focus mainly on anonymization in databases and networks, discuss some differences and interactions among the well-known models of k-anonymity and differential privacy and finally present some challenges to privacy that come from big data analytics.	big data;data anonymization	Julián Salas;Josep Domingo-Ferrer	2018	Mathematics in Computer Science	10.1007/s11786-018-0344-6	differential privacy;discrete mathematics;knowledge extraction;mathematics;cryptography;big data;data mining;data protection act 1998;privacy-enhancing technologies	Theory	-41.66456908430935	63.276890877497806	179452

With the appearance of Cloud Computing, there is a new paradigm: Cloud Storage. Cloud Storage means that the data owner moves its data to a Cloud Storage Server that is supposed to faithfully store the data and make it available to the data owner and perhaps the data requestors. This paper discusses how to guarantee the Provable Data Possession when data dynamics are supported. Different integrity granularities are supported including Size Integrity, Block-Number Integrity and the Block-neighborhood integrity which is realized by rules defined in Datalog through neighborhood relationship between data blocks. All integrity checking runs as a service in a Third Party Auditor. The whole architecture is implemented above Hadoop, which gives the first experience of a trustable cloud data service platform.	apache hadoop;cloud computing;cloud storage;datalog;dynamic data;outsourcing;programming paradigm;provable security	Jing Lu;Ting Dou	2014	JSW		cloud computing;computer science;operating system;data integrity;database;internet privacy;datalog;computer security	DB	-41.67872161509699	67.1731548486883	179475

In this paper, we study the problem of privacy protection in web search, with a special focus on IP-address based personalized web search. Our goal is to break the linkage between users’ identities (e.g., IP address) and their issued queries so as to prevent privacy breaches. Our privacy model, which shares similar characteristics of l-diversity in privacy preserving data publishing of relational data, provides a strong privacy guarantee in web search. The central idea of our privacy model is to protect user’s search activities within a social peer group. A social peer group contains a set of individual users. From search engines’s perspective, search queries issued by users from the same peer group cannot be uniquely linked to individuals within the group. A framework based on grouping social peer users is proposed to achieve the privacy requirement. We also provide some experimental results to show that our methods achieve high efficiency in practice.	algorithm;internet privacy;linear search;linkage (software);personalization;web search engine;web search query	Bin Zhou;Jian Xu	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-37210-0_46	privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;peer group;social;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-41.02639371833418	64.426597184125	180232

They are also often requested or even required by a third party to provide customer data that are deemed sensitive. In these circumstances, organizations are obligated to protect the privacy of the individuals involved while still benefiting from sharing data or meeting the requirement for releasing data. In this study, we analyze the tradeoff between privacy and data utility from the perspective of the data owner. We develop an incentive-compatible mechanism for the data owner to price and disseminate private data. With this mechanism, a data user is motivated to reveal his true purpose of data usage and acquire the data that suits to that purpose. Existing economic studies of information privacy primarily consider the interplay between the data owner and the individuals, focusing on problems that occur in the collection of private data. This study, however, examines the privacy issue facing a data owner organization in the distribution of private data to a third party data user when the real purpose of data usage is unclear and the released data could be misused.

There have been approaches to handle intruders in any system, however, these approaches are not fully trustable; evidently data is not totally protected. Real world databases have information that needs to be securely stored. The approach of generating negative database could help solve such problem. A Negative Database can be defined as a database that contains huge amount of data consisting of counterfeit data along with the real data. Intruders may be able to get access to such databases, but, as they try to extract information,they will retrieve data sets that would include both the actual and the negative data. In this paper we present our approach towards implementing the concept of negative database to help prevent data theft from malicious users and provide efficient data retrieval for all valid users.	data retrieval;data security;data theft;negative database;web application	Anup Patel;Niveeta Sharma;Magdalini Eirinaki	2009	2009 International Conference on Computing, Engineering and Information		web application;intelligent database;computer science;information security;data administration;data mining;database;view;information retrieval;database testing	DB	-41.2364670845263	63.92475633841938	180897
f38c6823ecd439eb9e6a6b4ac1a111747e97375b	achieve efficient and privacy-preserving medical primary diagnosis based on knn		Online medical primary diagnosis system, which can provide the pre-diagnosis service anywhere anytime, has attracted considerable interest. However, the flourish of online medical primary diagnosis system still faces many serious challenges since the sensitivity of personal health information and service provider''s diagnosis model. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving medical primary diagnosis scheme based on k-nearest-neighbors classification (kNN), called EPDK. With EPDK, medical users can ensure that their sensitive health information are not compromised during the online medical diagnosis process, and service provider can provide high-accuracy service without revealing its diagnosis model. Specifically, based on lightweight multiparty random masking and polynomial aggregation techniques, a medical user preprocesses her/his query vector before sending out and the preprocessed vector is directly operated in the service provider without obtaining original data, meanwhile, the primary diagnosis result cannot be achieved by anyone except the medical user. Through extensive analysis, we show that EPDK can resist multifarious known security threats, and has significantly lower computation complexity than existing schemes. Moreover, performance evaluations via implementing EPDK in the real environment demonstrate that EPDK is highly efficient in terms of computation overhead.	anytime algorithm;computation;confidentiality;data pre-processing;experiment;overhead (computing);polynomial;privacy	Dan Zhu;Hui Zhu;Ximeng Liu;Hui Li;Fengwei Wang;Hao Li	2018	2018 27th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2018.8487422	medical diagnosis;service provider;computer network;encryption;computation;computer science;the primary diagnosis;polynomial;information privacy	HPC	-43.00770495235007	65.17372530810837	180922

Security is a major issue for these healthcare organizations. Security concerns include breaches of privacy and medical identity theft. This article uses a hybrid technology acceptance model (TAM) to explore why healthcare organizations are slow to adopt an EHR and slower to adopt biometric technology and single sign-on functionality despite the benefits of these systems. This paper advocates that healthcare organizations should adopt biometrics for authentication purposes, allow for multiple connections by each healthcare provider, and use single sign-on systems when implementing EHR systems. This research will also determine how costs, compliance issues, and security issues impact an individual’s attitude when asked to use EHR systems.	authentication;biometrics;ibm tivoli access manager;pervasive informatics;privacy;single sign-on	Barbara Hewitt	2009			knowledge management;computer science;health care;medical record;technology acceptance model;biometrics;authentication;identity theft	Security	-44.98490754479566	62.5039006357407	181057

Cloud Computing offers a lot of benefits for end customers: high-end machines, incredible amounts of storage, high availability and everything available at the touch of a button. In this seminar we concentrate on compute clouds: Clouds, that do not only offer storage but also computations that can be outsourced in form of virtual machines (VMs). Outsourcing computations as well as data to a third party, in this case the cloud provider, are accompanied by the qualms of confiding data to the cloud provider based on blindly trusted service level agreements. The participants of this seminar discuss the involved risks, create threat models as basic assumptions that describe the (un-)trusted entities and present solutions that augment trust in the cloud provider, the integrity and verifiability of computations and data processed in the cloud.	cloud computing	Benny Pinkas;Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi;Nigel P.

In Austria, the official eID is the so called the Austrian citizen card and a means of choice for secure citizen identification and authentication. To facilitate the adoption of citizen card authentication at service providers within the Austrian e-Government strategy, the open source module MOA-ID has been developed. It acts as identity provider for different service providers and manages identification and authentication based on the Austrian citizen card. Currently, MOA-ID is deployed locally in every service provider's domain and is assumed to be fully trusted. With the increasing use of eIDs, however, a move into a public cloud might be advantageous due to benefits provided cloud computing, e.g., cost savings or scalability. Nevertheless, the move of a trusted service into the public cloud brings up new obstacles, in particular with respect to security and privacy. Therefore, in this paper we introduce and evaluate three different approaches on how the Austrian eID system based on MOA-ID could be securely moved into the cloud without violating any privacy or data protection aspects. To achieve this, we rely on various cryptographic methods and focus on minimum changes of the current identification and authentication process flow. Based on an evaluation of these three different approaches, we propose a model which can be generically used for eID identification and authentication in privacy-invasive environments such as the public cloud.	cloud computing;privacy	Bernd Zwattendorfer;Daniel Slamanig	2015	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2015.03.002	identification;cloud computing;computer science;cryptography;authentication;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;identity management	Crypto	-46.37015156401165	64.60033501555	181586
4a2013500c00a8e603256869d7abe1f069eef4e2	eer calculation and det approximation in a multi-threshold biometric system		Identity security in Health Information Systems is a major concern in order to guarantee patients confidentiality. Biometrics has been used in order to improve traditional identity authentication. In this work, we present a method to get the Detection Error Trade-off—DET—graph when two or more thresholds are involved in a biometric system. Consequently, we also provide a method to calculate the Equal Error Rate—EER—in a multi-threshold system. In general, we can calculate the EER visually through the DET graph or with a formula. However, the formula is applicable only with normal distributed data. Biometric data distribution is usually not normal; therefore, we cannot always use the formula to calculate the EER. We will be able to use this method in a biometric system with any type of data distribution and with any number of thresholds. The obtained results show that the difference of EER calculated with our method and the one calculated with the formula have a standard deviation of 0.62%.

In order to guarantee safety in food, an efficient tracking and tracing system is required. RFID devices allow recording all useful information for traceability directly on the commodity. The security issues are discussed and two different methods based on public cryptography are proposed and evaluated.

Yet, outsourcing storage and processing sensitive information, such as genomic data, comes with important concerns related to privacy and security. This calls for new sophisticated techniques that ensure data protection from untrusted cloud providers and that still enable researchers to obtain useful information. We present a novel privacy-preserving algorithm for fully outsourcing the storage of large genomic data files to a public cloud and enabling researchers to efficiently search for variants of interest. In order to protect data and query confidentiality from possible leakage, our solution exploits optimal encoding for genomic variants and combines it with homomorphic encryption and private information retrieval. Our proposed algorithm is implemented in C++ and was evaluated on real data as part of the 2016 iDash Genome Privacy-Protection Challenge. Results show that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions and enables researchers to search over millions of encrypted variants in a few seconds. As opposed to prior beliefs that sophisticated privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are unpractical for real operational settings, our solution demonstrates that, in the case of genomic data, PETs are very efficient enablers.	algorithm;behavior;c++;cloud computing;cloud database;computation (action);computer data storage;confidentiality;cuckoo hashing;exhibits as topic;experiment;extravasation;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;homomorphic encryption;information privacy;information sensitivity;jean;manuscripts;mesomelia-synostoses syndrome;outsourcing;personally identifiable information;plaintext;privacy-enhancing technologies;private information retrieval;protein information resource;question (inquiry);requirement;scalability;solutions;sousa;sparse matrix;spectral leakage;symmetric-key algorithm;variant call format;interest	João Sá Sousa;Cédric Lefebvre;Zhicong Huang;Jean Louis Raisaro;Carlos Aguilar Melchor;Marc-Olivier Killijian;Jean-Pierre Hubaux	2017		10.1186/s12920-017-0275-0	bioinformatics;data mining;information sensitivity;cloud computing;private information retrieval;outsourcing;biology;computer data storage;data protection act 1998	Security	-41.57408878490816	64.93588529026958	182575
f20c851bd3e088401b0062a435227defdaf08763	certificateless provable data possession scheme for cloud-based smart grid data management systems		The smart grid is considered to be the next-generation power system because of its reliability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. In recent years, the smart grid technology has attracted a lot of attention from both academia and industry. Advances in smart grid technologies are enabling more data to be collected and analyzed in real-time for many kinds of smart grid applications. As the amount of data increases, the traditional smart grid data management system cannot provide sufficient storage and processing capacities. To address these challenges, cloud computing is being introduced into the power system and the cloud-based smart grid data management system has been proposed to better support smart grid applications. In this cloud-based system, the data are stored and analyzed by the remote cloud server according to the requirements of smart grid applications. However, the loss of physical control over the smart grid data makes it a significant challenge in ensuring the integrity of the data. Many provable data possession schemes have been proposed in the past few years. However, most of them suffer from serious security weaknesses or poor performance. We propose an efficient certificateless provable data possession (CL-PDP) scheme for cloud-based smart grid applications. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is provably secure in a robust security model and can satisfy several security requirements. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme results in lower computation costs as compared to two recently proposed CL-PDP schemes.	cloud computing;computation;data hub;grid computing;provable security;real-time clock;requirement;server (computing);virtual private server	Debiao He;Neeraj Kumar;Sherali Zeadally;Huaqun Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2761806	computer security model;computer science;electric power system;security analysis;data modeling;computer network;cloud computing;smart grid;data management;server	HPC	-42.86391545502781	67.31464967439274	182663
e4f1e51031fa3d4f0fa11db6a75da00f1829b56a	utilizing fully homomorphic encryption to implement secure medical computation in smart cities		As healthcare is one of major socioeconomic problems in cities, mobile healthcare network becomes one of core components of smart cities, which would improve urban healthcare environment. However, there are wide privacy concerns as personal health information is outsourced to untrusted cloud servers. It is a promising method to encrypt the health data before outsourcing, but how to do diagnosis computations on the encrypted health data remains an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a general architecture of the mobile healthcare network, and define three typical secure medical computations, which include the average heart rate, the long QT syndrome detection, and the chi-square tests. To achieve computations on the ciphertext, we leverage fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to encrypt the health data. Different from previous related works, we use more efficient Dowlin’s FHE scheme to implement above three medical computations. In our implementation of the average heart rate, only one ciphertext is sent back to the receiver, so homomorphic decryption is needed once. We take an efficient l-bits comparator to implement the long QT syndrome detection, which only needs l XOR operations and one homomorphic multiplication. We first implement the chi-square tests by homomorphic additions and homomorphic multiplications, which can be used to study whether varicose veins is relevant to overweight. Extensive simulations and analytical results show the scalability and efficiency of our proposed scheme.	ciphertext;comparator;computation;exclusive or;homomorphic encryption;matrix multiplication;outsourcing;plaintext;preprocessor;qt (software);scalability;server (computing);simulation;smart city;virtual private server;wearable technology	Xiaoqiang Sun;Peng Zhang;Mehdi Sookhak;Jianping Yu;Weixin Xie	2017	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-017-1056-7	encryption;ciphertext;scalability;architecture;theoretical computer science;outsourcing;computer science;cloud computing;server;homomorphic encryption	Security	-43.071083594549094	65.09186382154229	183147

These markets currently are executed via trusted third parties, leading to potential fraud being able to be conducted by the market operators. We present a potential solution to this problem by using Multi-Party Computation to enable a trusted third party to be emulated in software. Our experiments show that whilst the standard market clearing mechanism of Continuous Double Auction in lit markets is not currently viable when executed using MPC, a popular mechanism for evaluating dark markets, namely the volume matching methodology, is viable. We present experimental validation of this conclusion by presenting the expected throughputs for such markets in two popular MPC paradigms; namely the two party dishonest majority setting and the honest majority three party setting.	.cda file;algorithm;computation;dark side;dark web;emulator;experiment;formal concept analysis;maximum throughput scheduling;move-to-front transform;online and offline;plaintext;privacy;sql server compact;traders;trusted third party;venue (sound system);while	John Cartlidge;Nigel P.

The computer systems of these users are weak-controlled and are outside of sphere of well-defined information security protection decisions. The technologies for data protection in case of theft or loss of computers and data devices and in case of data leakage are very important for eGovernment services users and must have appropriate properties to be useful for their security needs. A model of anti-theft technology implementation, which disables stolen computers and can send them data-destructive commands to erase sensitive data ,is presented. The technologies for control over the channels which can lead to data leakage protect data by whitelisting or blacklisting some devices or ports, by prohibit and allow some actions and operations, or by transparent encryption of outbound data. Some technologies for control over the leaving data use pre-defined set of sensitive data type definitions. Users can select definitions to apply or can customize some of them according specific conditions or regulations. At the end some conclusions about applicability of anti-theft and sensitive data leakage prevention technologies for protection of information security of eGovernment users was done.	apply;computer;confidentiality;data loss prevention software;encryption;information privacy;information security;spectral leakage;whitelist	Anton Palazov	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-19228-9_10	engineering;data security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-48.241090970358485	63.579765108422926	184741
e0977fa902bc7b1626b17a2176e6636d703e55e4	"""editorial preface for the special issue """"advances in security, privacy and trust technologies"""""""		With the fast development of Internet technologies, the information and communication systems are continuously facing new security, trust and privacy challenges. Indeed, the potentially invasive nature of the information has implications on privacy of the users and their online activity such as transactions. Likewise, the implicit reliance on technology to make decisions on one’s behalf makes essential to study new mechanisms for expressing and reasoning about trust. This special issue brings together research articles covering diverse aspects of security, privacy and trust in computer and networked-based information systems, including privacy concerns, tools to help secure information, methods for development and assessment of trustworthy systems, analysis of vulnerabilities and attacks, trends and new developments, secure operating systems and applications, security issues in wireless networks and pervasive systems, design and test strategies for secure and survivable systems, and cryptology, among others. The papers of the special issue are selected based on strict review results, where papers went through three rounds of review and revision. As a result, nine papers were selected and are arranged in the special issue as follows. Xiong et al. in the first paper ‘‘The finite volume element method for a parameter identification problem’’ use finite volume element method to solve a parameter identification problem of parabolic equations with over-specified data. The authors provide the numerical scheme of the unknown function and control parameters and obtain the error estimates of approximate solution. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated and compared with the exact solution to confirm the good accuracy of the presented scheme. The second paper by Chen et al. ‘‘An Opinion Mining Framework For Cantonese Reviews’’, analyze opinion mining for Cantonese language. The authors motivate the need to construct a particular lexical database for Cantonese and explore some Cantonese special written-tradition rules and incorporate them into the feature-based opinion summarization system framework. The experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the traditional Mandarin sentiment analysis method using ICTCLAS. In the third paper ‘‘A Secure Remote Data Integrity Checking Cloud Storage System from Threshold Encryption’’, Yao et al. study the confidentiality and integrity issues in cloud storage system. The authors address the privacy issue of decentralized cloud storage system using threshold cryptography. The threshold encryption scheme is therefore integrated with a secure decentralized erasure code to form a secure cloud storage system. Zhang et al. in the fourth paper ‘‘How to build a faster private information retrieval protocol’’, propose a secure multi-bit homomorphic encryption scheme based on Learning With Errors over Rings (RLWE) assumption.

48e7d2dd497538cec5e077b9c4ab518cc984650e	poster abstract: preserving iot privacy in sharing economy via smart contract		The phenomenal growth of Internet-services has created a vibrant new domain for sharing economy. Millions of users around the world share personal services and possessions with others – often complete strangers. Such sharing schemes also increase the risk of violation of one's informational and physical privacy. Strangers often have to trust each other with their privacy (e.g. a surveillance camera in an Airbnb room). However, very little research has been devoted to investigate privacy in sharing economy. In this paper, we explore the privacy concerns associated with contractual renting or leasing of IoT devices-enabled home. We propose a methodology to eliminate privacy threats from IoT-enabled telematics devices in a smart home via blockchain-based smart contract. For the purpose of illustration, we focus on how we can circumvent the privacy threat from indoor surveillance IP cameras in a smart home-sharing economy.	closed-circuit television;home automation;privacy;sharing economy;smart contract;telematics	Md.

Under the broadcast document dissemination strategy, a web document source periodically broadcasts (portions of) its documents to a potentially large community of users, without the need for explicit requests. By secure broadcasting, we mean that the delivery of information to users must obey the access control policies of the document source. Traditional access control mechanisms that have been adapted for XML documents, however, do not address the performance issues inherent in access control. In this paper, a labeling scheme is proposed to support rapid reconstruction of XML documents in the context of a well-known method, called XML pool encryption. The proposed labeling scheme supports the speedy inference of structure information in all portions of the document. The binary representation of the proposed labeling scheme is also investigated. In the experimental results, the proposed labeling scheme is efficient in searching for the location of decrypted information.	xml namespace	Hye-Kyeong Ko;Min-Jeong Kim;SangKeun Lee	2007	Inf.

50e771e1e3b97e98829adbdb49859228e595e6df	privacy of outsourced data		Data outsourced to an external storage server are usually encrypted since there is the common assumption that all data are equally sensitive. The encrypted data however cannot be efficiently queried and their selective release is not possible or require the application of specific solutions. To overcome these problems, new proposals have been recently developed, which are based on a fragmentation technique possibly combined with encryption. The main advantage of these proposals is that they limit the use of encryption, thus improving query execution efficiency. In this paper, we describe such fragmentation-based approaches focusing in particular on the different data fragmentation models proposed in the literature. We then conclude the paper with a discussion on some research directions.	encryption;external storage;file server;fragmentation (computing);server (computing)	Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati;Sara Foresti	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-14282-6_14	computer science;data mining;database;computer security	DB	-40.98793636241989	66.41238910484024	185445
cd5dc4f9373606ee60228d2f5706bfc6c45f682c	poster: locmask: a location privacy protection framework in android system	smartphone security;android;location privacy	The mobile users are facing a serious risk of losing location privacy (e.g., users' location information transmitted by open advertisement network, and the reported event of involuntary tracking of mobile users in popular mobile social apps). In this study, we design and implement LocMask, a system-level solution that provides location privacy protection in Android system. LocMask achieves the tradeoff of the privacy and the utility of location based services by providing the Quality of Protection (QoP) on demand, which sets different privacy protection levels to different locations based on how sensitive these locations are. Motivated by the fact that Top locations (e.g, user's home or office) are more sensitive than less visiting locations, LocMask provides location profile management module that records the user's mobility history and ranks the locations in terms of the user's visiting frequency. With users' location profiles, LocMask can automatically determines the sensitiveness of these locations as well as their corresponding privacy protection level. LocMask is also designed to incorporate various obfuscation techniques. The effectiveness of LocMask is supported by extensive real-world data based evaluations.	android;location-based service;privacy	Qiuyu Xiao;Jiayi Chen;Le Yu;Huaxin Li;Haojin Zhu;Muyuan Li;Kui Ren	2014		10.1145/2660267.2662367	privacy software;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;android	Security	-45.373461661323624	61.0553961107192	185786

Consequently, medical privacy invasion attracts people’s attention. Among these, we are particularly interested in the privacy preserving for association rule mining (ARM). In this paper, we improve the traditional reconstruction-based privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) and propose a new architecture for medical data publishing with privacy preserving, and we present a sanitization algorithm for the sensitive rules hiding. In this architecture, the sensitive rules are strictly controlled as well as the side effects are minimized. And finally we performed an experiment to evaluate the proposed architecture.

The geospatial data can either be digital raster images that represent the data on the earth in the form of pixels or digital vector data that is primarily from satellites. Due to the fact that many of the high-resolution satellites are commercial in nature, uncontrolled dissemination of the high resolution imagery may cause severe threats to national security as well as personal privacy. The severity of the threats is even more significant when this information is combined with vector maps or other publicly available vector data. In this paper, we present a GeoSpatial Authorisation System (GSAS), which is based on a GeoSpatial Authorisation Model (GSAM), for specifying and enforcing access control policies that makes reference to the spatial regions and locational credentials. The specification of authorisations is based on the spatial and temporal attributes associated with the image data, resolution of the images, geospatial credentials associated with users and privilege modes including view, zoom-in, overlay, view-thumbnail, view-annotation, identify, animate and fly-by that are relevant for geospatial image data.

This means a cloud service provider needs to make sure that its clients' outsourced data are stored securely and, data queries and retrievals are executed correctly and privately. On the other hand, it may also mean businesses are willing to outsource their data to a third party only if they trust their data are not accessible and visible to the service provider and other non-authorized parties. However, one of the major obstacles faced here for ensuring data reliability and security is Byzantine faults. While Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) has received growing attention from the academic research community, the research done is generally from the distributed computing point of view, and hence finds little practical use in cloud computing. To that end, the focus of this paper is to discuss how these faults can be tolerated with the authors' proposed conceptualization of Byzantine data faults and fault-tolerant architecture in cloud data management.	byzantine fault tolerance	Mohammed Abdullatif Alzain;Alice S.

f913c3a47106b51ca6566dcc37b2e52c0d549dc9	a secure cloud based personal health record framework for a multi owner environment		Personal Health Record (PHR) is an upcoming online service model for sharing health information. It helps patients to create, control, and share their health information with other users as well as healthcare providers. When PHR is outsourced to a third party semi trusted server, issues such as unauthorized access, privacy, and security concerns arise which remains an open challenge in a multi owner cloud environment. To overcome these challenges, a secure cloud based PHR framework for sharing PHRs among multiple users using attribute-based encryption (ABE) is proposed. In this proposed framework, patients can encrypt their PHRs and store them on semi trusted cloud servers. Moreover, patients can maintain control over access to their PHRs by assigning fine-grained, attribute-based access privileges to chosen data users. In order to achieve fine-grained access control, the proposed PHR framework is divided into personal domain (PSDs) and public domain (PUDs). To ensure security in a cloud based PHR framework, a secure key-policy attributebased encryption (S-KP-ABE) and privacy preserving decentralized collusion resistant attribute-based encryption (PP-DCR-ABE) algorithm is implemented in the PSDs and PUDs, respectively. From the experimental analysis, it is shown that the proposed cloud based PHR framework improves the efficiency of the system in terms of encryption, decryption, and key generation time in both the domains. Also, the proposed framework is proved to be collusion resistant and the security analysis ensures privacy preservation, trustworthiness between user and authorities, thereby enhancing the security of PHR users in a multi owner environment.	access control;algorithm;amazon simple storage service;attribute-based encryption;authorization;case preservation;key generation;multi-user;noscript;oddworld: abe's exoddus;online service provider;pixel;principle of least privilege;semiconductor industry;server (computing);tokenization (data security);trust (emotion)	D.

In this paper, we designed ontological models for healthcare workflow and multi-tenancy, and then applied HIPAA requirements on the models to generate HIPAA-compliant access control policies. We used Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to represent access control policies as rules, and we verified the rules with an OWL-DL reasoner. Additionally, we implemented HIPAA security rules through access control policies in a cloud-based simulated healthcare environment. More specifically, we investigated access control policy specification and enforcement for cloud based healthcare information systems using an open source cloud platform, OpenStack. The results manifest HIPAA compliance through authorization policies that are capable of addressing vulnerabilities of multi-tenancy.	access control;authorization;cloud computing;health insurance portability and accountability act;information sensitivity;information system;multitenancy;open-source software;platform as a service;requirement;role-based access control;scalability;semantic web rule language;semantic reasoner;software as a service	Mohd Anwar;Ashiq Imran	2015	2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing	10.1109/CSCloud.2015.95	cloud computing security;insurance;cloud computing;computer science;access control;operating system;multitenancy;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security	DB	-43.948377329398234	61.69197643388329	191100

However, most of these systems poorly support data security, and recent surveys show that their simplistic support for data protection is considered as a reason not to use them.1 In recent years, Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is getting more and more popularity, for its ability to provide highly flexible and customized forms of data protection at different granularity levels. In the current work, with the aim to raise users' confidence in the protection of data managed by NoSQL systems, we define a general approach to enforce ABAC within NoSQL systems. Our approach relies on SQL++[20], a unifying query language for NoSQL platforms. In particular, we develop a novel SQL++ query rewriting mechanism able to enforce heterogeneous types of ABAC policies specified up to cell level. Experimental results show an overhead which is not negligible for policies covering high percentage of the fields characterizing the protected documents, but which is far more contained when field level policies are more sparsely specified.	access control;data security;information privacy;multi-level governance;nosql;overhead (computing);query language;requirement;rewriting	Pietro Colombo;Elena Ferrari	2017	2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)	10.1109/ICDE.2017.123	data modeling;sql;computer science;access control;data mining;database;data protection act 1998;world wide web	DB	-42.49060608396674	61.14388184766316	191307

We propose a framework to detect such privacy violations and to eliminate undesired inferences. Our inference channel removal is based on modifying data that contribute to an inference. We show that our method is sound and complete. Soundness means that we modify only data items that lead to undesired inferences. Completeness means that we detect all inferences leading to undesired data disclosures. Finally, we show that our approach preserves data availability by minimizing the number of data items to be modified. An important aspect of our approach is that it sets the foundation for creating patient-specific privacy policies; an emerging need in the healthcare domain.	confidentiality;heuristic (computer science);information privacy;internet privacy;medical privacy;ontology (information science);personalization;privacy policy;prototype;scalability;user interface	Mark Daniels;Csilla Farkas	2018	2018 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI)	10.1109/BHI.2018.8333426	completeness (statistics);privacy policy;rdf;data mining;data availability;ontology (information science);information privacy;soundness;inference;computer science	DB	-42.464984140274794	63.01737512477554	192041

a6c7e1fa5fb7d33cc3b5f72a4aae65fd668fcfa0	cloud service platform of electronic identity in cyberspace		With the rapid prosperity and development of Internet of Things, identity management in cyberspace is becoming more and more important for activities concerning credibility and integrity such as E-commerce and E-government. Personal electronic identities in cyberspace associated in reality have been one significant and urgent scientific problem as online life becomes interwinded with reality. Thus, this paper presented a cloud service platform architecture based on electronic identity (eID), and pointed out security risk of the cloud service platform, and analyzed eID signature and whole lifecycle management mechanism to keep the correctness, uniqueness, consistency and continuity of eID state in the complexity and variety of terminal environment. Identity verification and attribute verification services were introduced as the most typical services with security and privacy to be used by personal users, enterprises, websites and foreign clouds. The capability and performance of the cloud service platform based on eID were discussed finally. Also, we have given that the application and development of the cloud service platform of electronic identity in cyberspace. And we get the result that the cloud service platform is more efficient, high performance and it can be used for wide application prospects.	cloud computing;correctness (computer science);cyberspace;digital identity;e-commerce payment system;e-government;identity management;identity verification service;internet of things;scott continuity	Bing Chen;Chengxiang Tan;Xiang Zou	2017	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-017-0731-9	operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	DB	-47.92835286296382	63.067460978885876	192408
23852bd1e74227da39a06930a4ecd4c59afc3e3d	harnessing the hybrid cloud for secure big image data service		Various kinds of image sensors capture a large number of images in Internet of Things (IoT) every day. It is increasingly concerned how to securely store and share these big image data from IoT. In this paper, we harness the hybrid cloud to provide secure big image data storage and share service for users. The basic idea is to partition each image into a small set of sensitive data and a large set of insensitive data, which are securely stored in the private cloud and the public cloud, respectively. Specially, the private cloud divides each image into the sensitive data (<20%) and the insensitive data (>80%) based on sensitivity identification approaches like Sobel edge detector. The sensitive data are encrypted in parallel at a counter mode and then stored in the private cloud. The insensitive data are encrypted-then-subsampled and then placed in the public cloud, in which the encryption employs the permutation-diffusion architecture and the subsampling utilizes compressed sampling technique. The keystreams used in encryption operations are managed by the tent-logistic system with high initial value sensitivity. Once users make a request for an image, the public cloud provides a privacy-guaranteed insensitive data reconstruction service, and the private cloud decrypts the sensitive and insensitive data and regroups them into a complete image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can provide secure big image data service.	block cipher mode of operation;chroma subsampling;cloud computing;computer data storage;edge detection;encryption;image sensor;internet of things;key space (cryptography);outsourcing;sampling (signal processing);sobel operator	Yushu Zhang;Hui Huang;Yong Xiang;Leo Yu Zhang;Xing He	2017	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2017.2732357	distributed computing;lossy compression;computer science;architecture;computer network;image sensor;encryption;cloud computing;data as a service;sobel operator;computer data storage	Security	-43.70385080958497	66.69476457895396	192720

4cd6a44206f2f74762da96a2efe42ccb63382403	validating data integrity with blockchain		Data manipulation is often named as a serious threat to data integrity. Data can be tampered with, and malicious actors could use this to their advantage. Data users in various application domains want to be ensured that the data they are consuming are accurate and have not been tampered with. To validate the integrity of these data, we describe a blockchain-based hash validation method. The method assumes that the actual data is stored separately from the blockchain, and then allows a data identifier and a hash of these data to be submitted to the blockchain. The actual data can be validated against the hash on the blockchain at any time. Several use cases are described for blockchain-based hash validation, and to validate the method it is implemented inside an application audit trail to validate the audit trail data. This implementation shows that blockchain-based hash validation is able to detect malicious and accidental changes that were made to the data.

ad7d257c05f1f64529bac27894aee1b42d298dc4	guest editorial: secure cloud computing for mobile health services	article	Seamless availability of medical and biological data to legitimate users is the top concern for healthcare systems that are being managed electronically. This demand, as a result, has paved multiple ways for modern technologies deployment in telemedicine and mobile healthcare services. The cloud computing technology deployment in healthcare systems is also considered as a part of the same initiative that has provided numerous benefits to this area. However, at the same time this also gave rise to the possibility of sensitive data exposure by various unpredictable threats associated with cloud computing technology. This threat landscape becomes more critical when it comes to the sensitive data and services management of a healthcare system. As noticed through the recent incidents, the healthcare systems are vulnerable to multiple threats, that may have serious impact on the healthcare working environment, safety of operations, patient’s data privacy and secure transmissions of medical data. Some of the reasons for these threats are the inherited or disguised vulnerabilities that evolve with time and are present in the cloud deployment models; public or private, as well as the service delivery models; Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Therefore, by the time these critical healthcare systems would rely on the newly deployed cloud technology, the existing vulnerabilities would have adversely affected these systems. In recent years, due to these security flaws, many healthcare organizations confronted undesired consequences in terms of reputation and losing public confidence. Although cloud security efforts and technologies have significantly evolved, however there still remains a need to address the novel threats that are continuously emerging and becoming complex with time. With evil intentions, these threats tend to pose repeated and sophisticated security attacks, which as a result continuously introduce malicious software and compromise the patient’s data privacy and healthcare security. The aim of this special issue was to attract original and the latest contributions, and to review and survey research and development on information assurance, data privacy and applications security in mobile healthcare systems. We received 16 articles, and each article was rigorously reviewed by at least three experts and finally we selected seven articles for publication.

7b53aa530ebb2d2ff6526878e42472ffcd654a86	integration of role based access control with homomorphic cryptosystem for secure and controlled access of data in cloud		Recent advances in cloud technology facilitates data owners having limited resources to outsource their data and computations to remote servers in Cloud. To protect against unauthorized information access, sensitive data are encrypted before outsourcing. However, traditional cryptosystems need decrypting ciphertext for outsourced computations that may violate data security as well may introduce higher computational complexity. Homomorphic encryption is a solution that allows performing computations directly on ciphertext. On the otherhand, it is evident that the computations on data may vary from users to users depending on the requirements. So, it is not always feasible to allow all computations to different users on the whole ciphertext stored in cloud. In this paper, we proposed a framework for integration of role based access control (RBAC) mechanism with homomorphic cryptosystem for secure and controlled access of data in cloud. Our proposed framework is developed based on trust and role hierarchy with multi-granular operational access rights to heterogeneous stakeholders or users.	authorization;ciphertext;cloud computing;computation;computational complexity theory;cryptography;cryptosystem;data security;feedback;homomorphic encryption;information access;outsourcing;perimeter;requirement;role hierarchy;role-based access control	Kamalakanta Sethi;Anish Chopra;Padmalochan Bera;Bata Krishna Tripathy	2017		10.1145/3136825.3136902	computer network;data security;cloud computing;ciphertext;encryption;cryptosystem;homomorphic encryption;computer science;distributed computing;role-based access control;server	Security	-41.74919709761504	67.16372500337269	195324

A sound remote transaction processing system for server-clients (one to many) structure is urgently needed. In this paper, a diagram of privacy encryption that features a star-like topology is introduced. Security requirements are presented by an adhoc manner. We proposed a concrete star-topological encryption scheme based on some reasonable hardness assumptions from computational group theory. The scheme achieves the confidentiality and non-repudiation of the delivered messages for server and clients. Therefore, these characteristics guarantee privacy for each client and prevent malicious attacks. Besides, our scheme is efficient, especially for batch processing.	a* search algorithm;batch processing;computational group theory;confidentiality;diagram;encryption;information system;non-repudiation;privacy;provable security;public-key cryptography;requirement;server (computing);symmetric-key algorithm;transaction processing system	Jing Li;Licheng Wang;Xinxin Niu	2016	2016 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS)	10.1109/INCoS.2016.11	privacy software;information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;encryption;server	DB	-43.92790251059904	65.04619095746627	195531

PHRs are very sensitive data and an inappropriate disclosure may cause serious problems to an individual. Therefore commercial Web-based PHR systems have to ensure that the patient health data is secured using state-of-the-art mechanisms. In current commercial PHR systems, even though patients have the power to define the access control policy on who can access their data, patients have to trust entirely the access-control manager of the commercial PHR system to properly enforce these policies. Therefore patients hesitate to upload their health data to these systems as the data is processed unencrypted on untrusted platforms. Recent proposals on enforcing access control policies exploit the use of encryption techniques to enforce access control policies. In such systems, information is stored in an encrypted form by the third party and there is no need for an access control manager. This implies that data remains confidential even if the database maintained by the third party is compromised. In this paper we propose a new encryption technique called a type-and-identity-based proxy reencryption scheme which is suitable to be used in the healthcare setting. The proposed scheme allows users (patients) to securely store their PHRs on commercial Web-based PHRs, and securely share their PHRs with other users (doctors).	access control;anytime algorithm;confidentiality;encryption;identity-based conditional proxy re-encryption;proxy server;upload	Luan Ibraimi;Qiang Tang;Pieter H.

5791d96e55d3cc25f0b5a4668cd51de2cb807aa8	secure e-health system on passive rfid: outpatient clinic and emergency care		In recent years, many researches have demonstrated several RFID-based solutions to enhance patient medication safety and avoid human errors. Although RFID-based procedure is more efficient than traditional process, patient&#x2019;s information may be attacked (or stolen) during the data transmission period. This will cause inappropriate medication use and medical errors. In this paper, we introduce a robust RFID-based e-Health system which strengthens the system security and protects the patient&#x2019;s privacy as well. In addition, our e-Health system can provide better efficiency of outpatient clinic procedure and emergency care procedure in hospital environment.

This extension has been implemented and can be used to communicate security incident related data in an anonymous and privacy-preserving manner within IT early warning systems. More concrete: it allows for anonymous distribution of arbitrary binary input data to participating peers. It hence addresses several obstacles, e.g., concerning reputation loss, that are nowadays reasons for a reluctant attitude regarding information sharing across different administrative domains.	entity;information exchange;mutual information;section 508 amendment to the rehabilitation act of 1973;secure multi-party computation	Dennis Titze;Hans Hofinger;Peter Schoo	2013	2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2013.214	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.25373400889035	64.25449583137032	199102
