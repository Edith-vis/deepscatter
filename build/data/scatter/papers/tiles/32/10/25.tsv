In 2004, Das et al. proposed a remote authentication scheme to authenticate users while preserving the users' anonymity. Their scheme adopted dynamic identification to achieve this function. Then in 2005, Chien and Chen pointed out Das et al. 's scheme fails to protect the user's anonymity and proposed a new remote authentication scheme preserving user anonymity. This paper, however, will demonstrate that Chien and Chen's scheme has also some problems: it cannot resist strong masquerading server/user attack, insider attack, denial of service attack and restricted replay attack; it also has the problem of slow wrong password detection. Therefore, an improved scheme is proposed to conquer these problems.	authentication;denial-of-service attack;e-commerce;entity–relationship model;password;replay attack;server (computing);smart card	Lanlan Hu;Yixian Yang;Xinxin Niu	2007	Fifth Annual Conference on Communication Networks and Services Research (CNSR '07)	10.1109/CNSR.2007.38	smart card;computer science;information security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.12442602503777	73.55357861253829	176316

However, most require the reader to search all tags in the system to identify a single tag. This problem makes the protocols impractical in large-scale RFID deployments. To address this problem, we propose a privacypreserving mutual authentication protocol for RFID systems with constant-time identification, based on Quadratic Residue. Furthermore, the validity period of each tag is stored in the database so the reader can revoke an expired tag. Formal security proof shows the proposed protocol has no obvious design defects. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed protocol achieves higher efficiency.	authentication protocol;exclusive or;hash function;mutual authentication;numerical integration;provable security;quadratic residue;radio-frequency identification;time complexity	Jingxian Zhou	2015	JCM	10.12720/jcm.10.2.117-123	computer science;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;challenge-handshake authentication protocol	Security	-46.02075984748628	74.37380094902471	176918

Meanwhile, attribute-based signature, in which each user is defined by a set of attributes, can also be used to realize anonymous authentication. Applying the attribute-based technology to ring signature, we propose a revocable attribute-based ring signature scheme with constant size signature. In our scheme, the data owner signs messages with strong anonymity while the attribute authority can revoke the anonymity of a signature when necessary. So the real signer can still form a ring arbitrarily while he must be responsible for his signature. Our scheme can also achieve other security characteristics such as unforgeability and collusion-resistance. Besides, the implementation of scheme is efficient for it is based on attribute rather than certificate. Furthermore, the size of signature as well as the computation overhead of signing and verifying process is constant, which is independent of the number of ring members. These properties are very interesting in real applications where data source authentication needs to be carried out under different scenarios.	authentication;computation;digital signature;overhead (computing);public key certificate;ring signature;verification and validation	Wenqiang Wang;Shaozhen Chen	2010	2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)	10.1049/iet-ifs.2009.0189	ring signature;digital signature;discrete mathematics;merkle signature scheme;computer science;cryptography;mathematics;internet privacy;blind signature;schnorr signature;elgamal signature scheme;computer security;algorithm	Vision	-41.185684344078645	73.23249743007874	177384

It has the advantages of high scalability, ease of use, cost effectiveness, and so on. However, the server that stores users' data may not be fully trustworthy. When users store their data in cloud storage, they concern much about data intactness. This is the goal of remote data possession checking schemes. This paper proposes a Hill cipher-based remote data possession checking scheme. The main idea of the scheme comes from the homomorphism of Hill cipher, namely the tags computed from plaintext blocks can be used to compare with the tags computed from ciphertext blocks. It has several advantages as follows. First, it is efficient in terms of computation and communication. Second, it allows verification without the need for the challenger to compare against the original data. Third, the scheme only needs to store a small amount of metadata and use only small challenges and responses. Finally, it performs data possession checking at the same time it provides confidentiality of data. The security and performance analysis illustrates that the scheme is feasible and effective.

Among important characteristics in the RFID tags, we mention the limitation of resources (memory, energy, ...). Our work focuses on the design of a RFID authentication protocol which uses biometric data and which confirms the secrecy, the authentication and the privacy. Our protocol requires a PRNG (Pseud-Random Number Generator), a robust hash function and Biometric hash function. The Biometric hash function is used to optimize and to protect biometric data. For Security analysis of protocol proposed, we will use AVISPA and SPAN tools to verify the authentication and the secrecy.

Though the benefits are clear, such a service is also relinquishing users' physical possession of their outsourced data, which inevitably poses new security risks toward the correctness of the data in cloud. In order to address this new problem and further achieve a secure and dependable cloud storage service, we propose in this paper a flexible distributed storage integrity auditing mechanism, utilizing the homomorphic token and distributed erasure-coded data. The proposed design allows users to audit the cloud storage with very lightweight communication and computation cost. The auditing result not only ensures strong cloud storage correctness guarantee, but also simultaneously achieves fast data error localization, i.e., the identification of misbehaving server. Considering the cloud data are dynamic in nature, the proposed design further supports secure and efficient dynamic operations on outsourced data, including block modification, deletion, and append. Analysis shows the proposed scheme is highly efficient and resilient against Byzantine failure, malicious data modification attack, and even server colluding attacks.	append;byzantine fault tolerance;cloud computing;cloud database;cloud storage;clustered file system;computation;correctness (computer science);display resolution;malware;server (computing);software project management	Xinyu Wang;Qian Wang;Kui Ren;Ning Cao;Wenjing Lou	2012	IEEE Transactions on Services Computing	10.1109/TSC.2011.24	erasure code;cloud computing security;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;data integrity;database;distributed computing;byzantine fault tolerance;distributed database;computer security;server;computer network	OS	-42.835929491783574	68.03772336692093	179629

Many secure search schemes have been focusing on the single-contributor scenario, where the outsourced dataset or the secure searchable index of the dataset are encrypted and managed by a single owner, typically based on symmetric cryptography. In this paper, we focus on a different yet more challenging scenario where the outsourced dataset can be contributed from multiple owners and are searchable by multiple users, i.e. multi-user multi-contributor case. Inspired by attribute-based encryption (ABE), we present the first attribute-based keyword search scheme with efficient user revocation (ABKS-UR) that enables scalable fine-grained (i.e. file-level) search authorization. Our scheme allows multiple owners to encrypt and outsource their data to the cloud server independently. Users can generate their own search capabilities without relying on an always online trusted authority. Fine-grained search authorization is also implemented by the owner-enforced access policy on the index of each file. Further, by incorporating proxy re-encryption and lazy re-encryption techniques, we are able to delegate heavy system update workload during user revocation to the resourceful semi-trusted cloud server. We formalize the security definition and prove the proposed ABKS-UR scheme selectively secure against chosen-keyword attack. Finally, performance evaluation shows the efficiency of our scheme.	access control;attribute-based encryption;authorization;cloud computing;cryptography;information privacy;lazy evaluation;multi-user;outsourcing;performance evaluation;proxy re-encryption;scalability;search algorithm;semiconductor industry;server (computing);symmetric-key algorithm;ur, ur/web;virtual private server	Wenhai Sun;Shucheng Yu;Wenjing Lou;Yiwei Thomas Hou;Hui Li	2014	IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847943	40-bit encryption;disk encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption	Security	-41.39790245419224	67.88198405729099	179693

While the two paradigms differ in several dimensions, they also share challenges, stemming from the lack of trust between outsourcers and workers. In this work, we propose a unifying trust framework, where correct participation is financially rewarded: neither participant is trusted, yet outsourced computations are efficiently verified and validly remunerated. We propose three solutions for this problem, relying on an offline bank to generate and redeem payments; the bank is oblivious to interactions between outsourcers and workers. We propose several attacks that can be launched against our framework and study the effectiveness of our solutions. We implemented our most secure solution and our experiments show that it is efficient: the bank can perform hundreds of payment transactions per second and the overheads imposed on outsourcers and workers are negligible.	cloud computing;electronic funds transfer;experiment;formal verification;interaction;online and offline;outsourcing;secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;stemming;transactions per second;volunteer computing	Bogdan Carbunar;Mahesh V.

The main contribution is provided by a service named Elias which acts as a proxy between clients and the chain replication system. Elias is a trusted service that ensures the secure communication between clients and the replication system while detecting any arbitrary failures through cryptographic hashing. Elias also provides reconfiguration for the chain to eliminate the node affected by a crash or arbitrary failure.	crash (computing);cryptographic hash function;cryptography;proxy server;secure communication;sensor	Berkin Guler;Öznur Özkasap	2017	2017 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking) and Workshops	10.23919/IFIPNetworking.2017.8264892	cryptographic hash function;control reconfiguration;computer network;throughput;public-key cryptography;secure communication;computer science;crash	Networks	-46.93950296598318	71.10185741745738	179902

When we are dealing with payments of high value, bank transfers are preferred. But this kind of payments does not allow the anonymity of the parties involved in the commercial transaction. Electronic checks is a useful payment system for this kind of scenario, but the proposed solutions do not allow an anonymous transference as in paper-based checks. In this paper, we propose a new electronic bearer bank check scheme. The system allows the e-check to be transferred to any person by its owner without depositing it, and remaining anonymous in front of the bank.	e-commerce;electronic funds transfer;penetration test	M.

The proposed scheme is different from the methods which are based on the concept of key- lock pairs. In the proposed scheme, each user is assigned a binary key, which is derived from the access rights with respect to the files. The binary key is possessed by the user, and can be used to derive the access right to the files. The characteristics of the proposed scheme are that the system can protect the files without explicitly maintaining an access control matrix, the derivation of the access rights is simple, and the dynamic access control can be easily achieved.	access control	Chin-Chen Chang;Jao-Ji Shen;Tzong-Chen Wu	1994	Computers & Security	10.1016/0167-4048(94)90050-7	computer access control;discretionary access control;computer science;access control;role-based access control;database;computer security;random access;sequential access;computer network;network access device	Crypto	-41.989138125342606	68.2185180795562	180612

A provably secure trusted access protocol MN-TAP for the WLAN Mesh Networks is proposed.

Meanwhile, the protocol can realize the platform authentication and platform integrity verification in the first round of protocol interaction, which will improve the efficiency of the protocol and decrease the overhead of the server. We use a provably secure model, named the universally composable secure model, to analyze the security of the protocol. And we use of compare analysis to discover the performance advantages of the protocol.

The use of location information can be used for enhancing the security of an application, and it can also be exploited to launch attacks. For critical applications, a formal model for location-based access control is needed that increases the security of the application and ensures that the location information cannot be exploited to cause harm. In this paper, we show how the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model can be extended to incorporate the notion of location. We show how the different components in the RBAC model are related with location and how this location information can be used to determine whether a subject has access to a given object. This model is suitable for applications consisting of static and dynamic objects, where location of the subject and object must be considered before granting access.	computer fraud;computer security;cyberspace;dorothy e. denning;elisa bertino;formal language;formal specification;location-based authentication;location-based service;mobile device;neo geo;nv network;prasad v. tetali;proceedings of the ieee;role hierarchy;role-based access control;spaces;specification language;ubiquitous computing;z notation	Indrakshi Ray;Mahendra Kumar;Lijun Yu	2006		10.1007/11961635_10	systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;access control;wireless network;role-based access control;formal specification;mobile device;mobile computing;computer security;information system	Security	-46.96886209980223	68.92767409558037	181474

Cloud has the massive storage, computational power and software which can be used by clients for reducing their computational overhead and storage limitation. But in case of outsourcing, privacy of client's confidential data must be maintained. We have designed a protocol for outsourcing large scale Eigen value problem to a malicious cloud which provides input/output data security, result verifiability and client's efficiency. As the direct computation method to find all eigenvectors is computationally expensive for large dimensionality, we have used power iterative method for finding the largest Eigen value and the corresponding Eigen vector of a matrix. For protecting the privacy, some transformations are applied to the input matrix to get encrypted matrix which is sent to the cloud and then decrypting the result that is returned from the cloud for getting the correct solution of Eigen value problem. We have also proposed result verification mechanism for detecting robust cheating and provided theoretical analysis and experimental result that describes high-efficiency, correctness, security and robust cheating resistance of the proposed protocol.	analysis of algorithms;client (computing);cloud computing;computation;confidentiality;correctness (computer science);cryptography;data security;eigen (c++ library);encryption;formal verification;input/output;iterative method;outsourcing;overhead (computing);sensor	Jarin Firose Moon;Shamminuj Aktar;M.

In this paper, an identity-based (t, n) threshold proxy signcryption scheme using bilinear pairings is proposed.

This mathematical function varies for each login session and also we will reveal only a few positions of the virtual password but not the complete virtual password.	authentication;data logger;keystroke logging;login session;password;phishing;user identifier	N.

Coconut integrates with blockchains to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and availability even when a subset of credential issuing authorities are malicious or offline. We implement and evaluate a generic Coconut smart contract library for Chainspace and Ethereum; and present three applications related to anonymous payments, electronic petitions, and distribution of proxies for censorship resistance.

This requirement on privacy is neither realized by PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure with X.509 certificates) based access control nor by anonymous access.

This system can randomly store messages into a storage pool built on frequently colliding hash table (FCHT) as an alternative way of DHT, and each message will be covered promptly after the expiry of validity period. This approach makes the message unrecoverable by multiple-pass Gutmann method and supports general secret sharing or encryption with counting control for personal data privacy. Moreover, we give a fundamental mathematical model of birth-death processes, in which we provide a detailed performance analysis by some theorems, including erasure distribution, recovery probability, secure erasure time, capacity of recycle pool. Experimental results indicated that our system is more efficient and accurate for controlling message self-destruction cycle, and makes it hard or impossible to recover data in a forensic investigation.	data remanence;data system;encryption;gutmann method;information privacy;mathematical model;personally identifiable information;randomness;secret sharing;self-destruct;storage model;zeroisation	Yan Zhu;Shuai Yang;Guohua Gan;Xiao He	2018	2018 IEEE 42nd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.00157	gutmann method;hash table;real-time computing;encryption;secret sharing;computer science;data modeling;information privacy;erasure;server;distributed computing	DB	-42.84121958920304	68.43401232874653	183911

A single server manages the entire tree structure in such schemes. Failure of that server leads to single point failure which interrupts the group communication. In this paper we propose a method to avoid single point failure by distributing user information among set of X number of servers and use (t,X) threshold scheme to reconstruct the tree. The new auxiliary keys and group key are computed partly by the users which reduces number of encryptions required to communicate new set of keys to the remaining group members.	group key;interrupt;key management;scalability;secret sharing;server (computing);single point of failure;tree structure	A.

19a1257ad8d93944157150e00939c1b9933eb1de	an enhanced security protocol for vanet-based entertainment services	digital signature;nonrepudiation;security protocol	Multimedia transactions between vehicles are expected to become a promising application in VANETs but security is a fundamental issue that must be resolved before such transactions can become practical and trusted. Existing certificate-based digital signature schemes are ineffective for ensuring the security of multimedia transactions in VANETs. This ineffectiveness exists because there is no guarantee that (1) vehicles can download the latest certificate revocation lists or that (2) vehicles can complete a multimedia transaction before leaving their communication range. These two problems result, respectively, from a lack of infrastructure and from the inconsistent connectivity inherent in VANETs. In this paper, we propose a digital signature approach that combines a certificateless signature scheme and short-lived public keys to alleviate these problems. We then propose a security protocol that uses the proposed signature approach for multimedia transactions between vehicles. The proposed protocol enables vehicles to trade in multimedia resources without an online trust authority. We provide an analytical approach to optimizing the security of the proposed protocol. The security and performance of our protocol are evaluated via simulation and theoretical analysis. Based on these evaluations, we contend that the proposed protocol is practical for multimedia transactions in VANETs in terms of security and performance. key words: VANET security, multimedia transaction, security protocol, nonrepudiation, digital signature	communications protocol;computation;cryptographic protocol;digital signature;download;non-repudiation;pkc (conference);public-key cryptography;regular expression;requirement;simulation	Jung-Yoon Kim;Hyoung-Kee Choi	2012	IEICE Transactions		cloud computing security;digital signature;non-repudiation;security information and event management;computer science;security service;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-46.178800412892066	73.80877233549049	184819

Under the premise of ensuring data owner and user data security, the scheme supports the addition and multiplication operations of ciphertext, and ensures faster execution efficiency and meets the security requirements of cloud computing. Security analysis shows that our scheme is safe. Performance assessment demonstrates that our scheme can more efficiently implement data than DGHV scheme.	ciphertext;cloud computing;data security;homomorphic encryption;requirement	Zuowei Wu;Taoshen Li	2017		10.1145/3127404.3127461	encryption;theoretical computer science;premise;data security;security analysis;cloud computing;ciphertext;computer science;multiplication;homomorphic encryption;distributed computing	Security	-41.762206245460675	67.71727736214562	185062

We make use of this consistency property to detect and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks in a key exchange such as Diffie-Hellman or ECDH. Essentially, the MitM attack creates an inconsistency in the world views of the two honest parties, and they can detect it with the help of the ledger. Thus, there is no need for prior knowledge or trusted third parties apart from the distributed ledger. To prevent impersonation attacks, we require user interaction. It appears that, in some applications, the required user interaction is reduced in comparison to other user-assisted key-exchange protocols.	authenticated key exchange;authentication;denial-of-service attack;diffie–hellman key exchange;livecode;man-in-the-middle attack;out-of-band agreement;requirement	Thanh Bui	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-71075-4_16	world wide web;computer science;internet privacy;ledger;key exchange;authentication	Security	-43.24320678496731	72.56385292496253	185711
db017bdeac5090bcb8172014966801f48750939d	secure modular password authentication for the web using channel bindings		Secure protocols for password-based user authentication are well-studied in the cryptographic literature but have failed to see wide-spread adoption on the Internet; most proposals to date require extensive modifications to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, making deployment challenging. Recently, a few modular designs have been proposed in which a cryptographically secure password-based mutual authentication protocol is run inside a confidential (but not necessarily authenticated) channel such as TLS; the password protocol is bound to the established channel to prevent active attacks. Such protocols are useful in practice for a variety of reasons: security no longer relies on users’ ability to validate server certificates and can potentially be implemented with no modifications to the secure channel protocol library.	authentication;password	Mark Manulis;Douglas Stebila;Nick Denham	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14054-4_11	s/key;challenge–response authentication;internet privacy;one-time password;world wide web;password;computer security;password strength	Crypto	-45.52934281979841	72.53383189096007	185966

In an ABS scheme, the attribute authority (A-authority) generates the private key for any users, hence it has to be completely trusted. The A-authority is free to engage in malicious activities without any risk of being confronted in a court of law. Motivated by this, we firstly propose a notion of accountable authority attribute-based signature scheme in this paper. It is not only a variant of ABS, but also a new approach to mitigate the key escrow problem. Then we construct an accountable authority attribute-based signature scheme. Finally we prove its security under the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) and the Modified Computational Diffie-Hellman (MCDH) assumptions. Our main goal is to restrict the ways that the A-authority can misbehave. In our scheme, if the A-authority maliciously generates and distributes a private key, it will runs the risk of being caught and prosecuted.	computational diffie–hellman assumption;digital signature;key escrow;malware;public-key cryptography	Yan Ren;Chunming Tang;Guilin Wang;Duncan S.

a4b03aff10e651dbc179567c61bd0b8e0b206f36	privacy-preserving outsourced auditing scheme for dynamic data storage in cloud		As information technology develops, cloud storage has been widely accepted for keeping volumes of data. Remote data auditing scheme enables cloud user to confirm the integrity of her outsourced file via the auditing against cloud storage, without downloading the file from cloud. In view of the significant computational cost caused by the auditing process, outsourced auditing model is proposed to make user outsource the heavy auditing task to third party auditor (TPA). Although the first outsourced auditing scheme can protect against the malicious TPA, this scheme enables TPA to have read access right over user’s outsourced data, which is a potential risk for user data privacy. In this paper, we introduce the notion of User Focus for outsourced auditing, which emphasizes the idea that lets user dominate her own data. Based on User Focus, our proposed scheme not only can prevent user’s data from leaking to TPA without depending on data encryption but also can avoid the use of additional independent random source that is very difficult to meet in practice. We also describe how to make our scheme support dynamic updates. According to the security analysis and experimental evaluations, our proposed scheme is provably secure and significantly efficient.	dynamic data	Tengfei Tu;Lu Rao;Hua Zhang;Qiaoyan Wen;Jia Xiao	2017	Security and Communication Networks	10.1155/2017/4603237	computer security;computer science;cloud computing;cloud storage;database;encryption;information privacy;dynamic data;information technology;upload;audit	Security	-42.32629358242432	67.7851482201361	187092

Network layer encryption such as IPSec is more flexible than higher layer solutions since it is not application-dependent and can protect all end-to-end traffics that go between two hosts. Using IPSec, two hosts must first establish a session key through message exchanges before they can communicate. In this paper, we present an Identity Based Encryption (IBE) scheme that allows a host to calculate the per-packet encryption key based on the IP address of the destination host, without going through the expensive key exchange process as in IPSec. Our mechanism is compatible with the current IP protocol and we tested our scheme with live HTTP and ICMP traffic. Our results show that our protocol provides a zero-configuration network layer encryption solution for end-to-end secure communications that is ideal for consumer electronics applications.	centralized computing;coexist (image);communications protocol;confidentiality;datagram;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;field-programmable gate array;hypertext transfer protocol;id-based encryption;ipsec;information privacy;internet protocol suite;key (cryptography);key exchange;key server (cryptographic);network packet;no-communication theorem;secure communication;session key;strong cryptography;throughput;unique key;zero-configuration networking	Sammy H.

Our analysis shows the scheme is vulnerable to Man-in- the-middle attack. What's more, there are obvious security vulnerabilities in it. An improved remote user authentication scheme based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol is proposed. Analysis shows the scheme is secure not only to achieve mutual authentication, but also to generate a session key in the same time. It has overcome security deficiencies of Liaw-Lin-Wu's scheme. It is efficient and practical.	authentication;man-in-the-middle attack	Xiancun Zhou;Yan Xiong;Renjin Liu	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34041-3_1	data authentication algorithm;reflection attack;challenge–response authentication;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-45.27904513124769	74.44883502725853	188895

Specifically, we present a secure adaptive algorithm for data fragment allocation on multiple nodes of the system. The algorithm handles (replicated) data fragments, stored by nodes without the need of encryption, in such a way to ease information sharing. Data confidentiality is guaranteed in the presence of passive and active attacks, and fragments are dynamically reallocated/replicated in the system to converge, under assumptions of regularity of the read-write activity, to an allocation that provably guarantees highest performance in terms of network load.	access control;adaptive algorithm;confidentiality;converge;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;encryption;icdcs;overhead (computing);read-write memory;requirement	Giorgio Zanin;Alessandro Mei;Luigi V.

5e54e4bb0bd252e946129d53f714decb4b36b851	anonus: anonymous bonus point system with fraud detection		Bonus point systems are widely used for rewarding customer loyalty in both traditional and electronic commerce scenarios. Merchants aim to additionally increase revenue by targeted advertising using customer data. At the same time, customers wish to protect their privacy of what they purchase. Common systems neither provide sufficient protection of privacy, nor protect the customers' identities. Anonymity makes it significantly harder to properly resolve claims of fraudulent transactions, because identities are not recorded for any purpose after a transaction has been committed. We propose an anonymous bonus system based on digital payment systems using blind cryptographic signatures. We implement a protocol extension that allows proof of bonus point possession in case of reported misbehavior, and we identify the implications on security, privacy, and performance of our proposals. Our results show that we can resolve these cases of fraud within the system without losing functionality in the bonus point protocol.

Few papers have focused on secure mobile multimedia distribution that protects both the confidentiality and copyright in mobile multimedia services. In this paper, a secure multimedia distribution scheme is presented for a ubiquitous mobile content service, i.e., the Mobile TV based on the converged DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting – Handheld) and GPRS/GSM. At the server side, the Joint Compression and Encryption method is proposed to encrypt video contents. At the mobile terminal side, the Joint Decryption and Fingerprinting method is proposed to decrypt video contents and simultaneously embed the mobile terminal’s identification information. When the media content is illegally redistributed to public networks, such as Internet or public TV, the proposed Fingerprint Detection and Traitor Tracing method will be used to identify the illegal redistributor. To show the proposed scheme’s prior performances, the existing secure media distribution schemes are reviewed, and the comparative evaluations are done. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more suitable for secure mobile multimedia distribution. The work is expected to attract more researchers. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

With no a priori image pre-alignment, alignment-free cancelable fingerprint templates do not suffer from inaccurate singular point detection. In this paper, we develop a blind system identification approach to the design of alignment-free cancelable fingerprint templates. The binary string, derived from quantized pair-minutiae vectors, is to be secured and its frequency samples act as the input to the proposed algorithm. Motivated by the identifiability of the source signal in blind system identification, we propose to protect the binary string's frequency samples, which are treated as the source input, by countering or dissatisfying the identifiability condition so that they cannot be recovered from the output complex vector (transformed template). The proposed transform is irreversible because when the identifiability condition is not met, non-identification of the source input is theoretically guaranteed in blind system identification. Security, matching performance and resource requirement are the main factors in cancelable template design. With the size of the transform parameter key and transformed templates being moderate, the proposed method suits resource-limited applications, e.g., smartcards, driver license and mobile phones. Evaluation of the proposed method over FVC2002 DB1, DB2 and DB3 shows that the new method exhibits favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art alignment-free cancelable fingerprint templates.

The proposed joint watermarking protocol embeds a single watermark signal into the content while taking care of the various security concerns such as proof of involvement in the distribution chain, nonrepudiation of the involvement and protection against false framing of the different parties involved. Further, in the event of finding an illegal copy of the content, the identities of all the parties involved in that content distribution chain can be traced back by extracting the watermark information.	algorithm;care-of address;cathode ray tube;computation;digital distribution;digital rights management;digital watermarking;framing (world wide web);non-repudiation;polynomial remainder theorem	Tony Thomas;Sabu Emmanuel;Amitabha Das;Mohan S.

09697cf9dee15d42b13f20be0334a19099e5f2b4	integrity protection of ndef message with flexible and enhanced nfc signature records		The NFC-Forum released a specification of Signature Record Type Definition (SRTD) shortly after the attacks related to NFC tags surfaced in 2009. The specification adds digital signatures to provide authenticity and integrity to the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) messages. However, the specification in its current form has some shortcomings. For instance it has very limited options for signature algorithms. Further there is no fully-compliant implementation of the SRTD and the application developers might end up implementing their own integrity solution in non-standard (non-compliant to SRTD) way. In this paper, we revamp the current SRTD specification to improve its deficiencies. First, we propose a larger and more flexible combination of signature algorithms for efficient authentication of tag data. Subsequently, we develop a fully compliant prototype of our modified SRTD with all the standard authentication/certification primitives on NFC-based tags and Smartphone. Finally, we perform an in-depth performance evaluation of different signing and verification operations that focuses on execution time and data overheads.	algorithm;android;antivirus software;cryptography;data integrity;digital signature;ecosystem;heterogeneous system architecture;message authentication;near field communication;performance evaluation;prototype;run time (program lifecycle phase);signature record type definition;smartphone;usability	Sufian Hameed;Usman Murad Jamali;Adnan Samad	2015	2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA	10.1109/Trustcom.2015.396	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-46.08066071241308	73.65766406111526	191780

In 2013, Jiang et al. proposed privacy preserving authentication scheme for TMIS. Recently, Wu and Xu analyzed Jiang's scheme and identify serious security flaws in their scheme, namely, user impersonation attack , DoS attack and off-line password guessing attack. In this article, we analyze Wu and Xu's scheme and show that their scheme is also vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack and does not protect user anonymity. Moreover, we identify the inefficiency of incorrect input detection of the login phase in Wu and Xu's scheme, where the smart card executes the login session in-spite of wrong input.	authentication;correctness (computer science);cryptanalysis;denial-of-service attack;information system;login session;online and offline;password cracking;polynomial-time approximation scheme;scalability;smart card;upwind scheme	Dheerendra Mishra;Sourav Mukhopadhyay	2013	CoRR		computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.058463977327904	74.17838025356328	191954

In this paper, we present two authentication methods that demonstrate better performance in terms of authentication latency and energy consumption of a mobile terminal, compared to the 3G cellular network approach of home network transporting authentication vector to visited network. The proposed Method I, referred to as Nonce-based Authentication, eliminates the sequence numbers used in the 3G roaming authentication and employs the key derivation and caching technique for mobile terminal and visited network. The proposed Method II, called Lightweight Localized Authentication, introduces the computation-efficient protocol based on a carefully designed public key certificate infrastructure. With the design goal of achieving security by lower cost, both methods significantly reduce the communication overhead between home and visited networks for roaming authentication, as indicated by analytical and experimental result.	authentication;communications protocol;computation;cryptographic nonce;key management;mobile phone;overhead (computing);public key certificate;public-key cryptography	Men Long;Chwan-Hwa John Wu;J.

The group key initial distribution based on basic signature can not efficiently protect the privacy of the entering member since the basic signature can be verified by anyone using the corresponding public key. In this paper, we propose a directed signature scheme based on the elliptic curve ElGamal cryptosystems and apply it to the group key initial distribution for a confidential group communication. Through comparing to the elliptic curve ElGamal digital signature scheme in terms of computational cost using statistical hypothesis t-test two samples for means and Wilcoxon rank sum test, the results of the experiment show that our directed signature scheme is not significantly different from the digital signature scheme in statistics so that the group key initial distribution based on our directed signature scheme not only efficiently protects the privacy of the entering member but also saves the computation resources.	adversary (cryptography);computation;computational complexity theory;confidentiality;cryptosystem;digital signature;group key;personally identifiable information;privacy;public-key cryptography	Qian Wei;Jingsha He;Huiying Shao	2009		10.1145/1655925.1655972	ring signature;private information retrieval;communication in small groups;computer science;distributed computing;public-key cryptography;elliptic curve;kcdsa;group signature;blind signature;schnorr signature;elgamal signature scheme;computer security	Security	-41.49247937628658	73.53111901621081	192977

However, most of constructions focuses only on the data security, rather than on user privacy protection. In order to protect users’ attribute privacy, recently, a novel secure CP-AB-PRE named anonymous CP-AB-PRE was first proposed by Zhang et al. However, we found that their scheme fails to achieve anonymity, which means that their scheme cannot realize users’ attribute privacy protection. In order to remedy this security gap, a novel anonymous CP-AB-PRE scheme is proposed, which can protect user attribute privacy by hiding the access policy. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient.	encryption;proxy re-encryption	Hongjian Yin;Leyou Zhang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72389-1_28	anonymity;computer security;encryption;security analysis;data security;computer science;proxy re-encryption	Crypto	-41.8566719539354	68.18786571713495	193164

In real-time teleradiology services, the system is expected to respond very quickly however to verify the signature a considerable amount of time is spent to compute the hash value of the image since the image size might be huge (tens of megabytes). Motivating by this fact, in this paper we propose EVEREST, an efficient methodology for verification. The key observation we have made is that in the traditional verification the processor of the verifying machine is idle (I/O blocked) while the image is downloaded. In EVEREST, to improve the real-time efficiency the receiver can perform most of the hash computation while he is receiving the image itself. One other important advantage of our scheme is the communication efficiency since getting the entire image file is no longer necessary to detect the tampering.	computation;digital signature;electronic signature;hash function;image file formats;image resolution;input/output;marijuana abuse;megabyte;real-time clock;real-time transcription;teleradiology;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;verification and validation;verification of theories;verifying specimen	Kemal Bicakci;Nazife Baykal	2004	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-949-3-1241	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	EDA	-45.01358842704837	68.28487304081418	193598

Mobile technologies such as radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags, PDAs and mobile phone systems are increasingly being deployed in pervasive computing. These mobile devices have raised public concern regarding violation of privacy, anonymity and information confidentiality. Considering these concerns, there is a growing need to discover and develop techniques and methods to overcome the threats described above. In this paper we propose an architecture which enhances the privacy and anonymity of users in ubiquitous computing and yet preserves the security requirements of the system. Our proposed architecture is based on elliptic curve techniques, on MaptoCurve or MapToPoint function, on Weil pairing techniques and finally on elliptic curve based Okamoto identification scheme. In addition, we present a formal validation of our protocol by using the AVISPA tool. The main comparative study of our proposed architecture is to provide privacy and anonymity for mobile users. Our proposed architecture achieves many of desirable security requirements.	algorithm;computation;confidentiality;elliptic curve cryptography;encryption;identification scheme;key-agreement protocol;mobile device;mobile phone;mutual authentication;personal digital assistant;pervasive informatics;privacy;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;replay attack;requirement;secure communication;server (computing);ubiquitous computing	Pierre E.

This vast amount of private information, however, is often misused not only by adversaries, but also by the providers themselves. End-to-end email encryption is considered the most robust defense against this threat, however, its many requirements make this approach impractical for protecting everyday emails. In this paper, we present Email Cloak, an email alias service with public key encryption capabilities. Email Cloak relaxes email encryption requirements by relying on a privacy-respecting third-party. Emails sent and received by the user are automatically encrypted with her public key by Email Cloak before being forwarded to, and stored by her email provider. This approach, while seemingly straightforward, offers multiple benefits: simplified key management, selective and automatic encryption, advanced deployment options and transparency towards other parties. Moreover, our experimental evaluation shows that the overhead introduced by Email Cloak is adequate for email communications. We have also made our implementation publicly available.

Each user is assigned a secret key used to efficiently derive his successors' secret key and assigned an encryption key at the same time used to encrypt his information items or files only. Thus, any user can freely change his own encryption key for some security reasons without caring about those security classes with lower clearances to make their information items been reenciphered. And moreover, make a security class be added into or deleted from the hierarchy without changing any issued keys.	access control;cryptography;discrete logarithm;encryption;key (cryptography)	Chin-Chen Chang;Iuon-Chang Lin;Hui-Min Tsai;Hsiao-Hsi Wang	2004	18th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, 2004.

This is because short secrets are convenient, particularly for an increasingly mobile user population. Many users are interested in employing a variety of computing devices with different forms of connectivity and different software platforms. Such users often find it convenient to authenticate by means of passwords and short secrets, to recover lost passwords by answering personal or “life” questions, and to make similar use of relatively weak secrets. In typical authentication methods based on short secrets, the secrets (or related values) are stored in a central database. Often overlooked is the vulnerability of the secrets to theft en bloc in the event of server compromise. With this in mind, Ford and Kaliski and others have proposed various password “hardening” schemes involving multiple servers, with password privacy assured provided that some servers remain uncompromised. In this paper, we describe a new, two-server secure roaming system that benefits from an especially lightweight new set of protocols. In contrast to previous ideas, ours can be implemented so as to require essentially no intensive cryptographic computation by clients. This and other design features render the system, in our view, the most practical proposal to date in this area. We describe in this paper the protocol and implementation challenges and the design choices underlying the system.	authentication;authorization;computation;credential;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;database;digital signature;download;encryption;hardening (computing);key (cryptography);password;server (computing);systems architecture	John G.

4aff0f14f1c32992f757ea8b23ac1f266182deb6	provably secure identity-based signcryption scheme for crowdsourced industrial internet of things environments		Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing have become more pervasive in the context of the industry as digitization becomes a business priority for various organizations. Therefore, industries outsource their crowdsourced Industrial IoT (IIoT) data in the cloud in order to reduce the cost for sharing data and computation. However, the privacy of such crowdsourced data in this environment has attracted wide attention across the globe. Signcryption is the significant cryptographic primitive that meets both requirement of authenticity and confidentiality of crowdsourced data among users/industries, and thus, it is ideal for ensuring secure authentic data storage and transmission in industrial crowdsourcing environments. In this paper, we introduce a new identity-based signcryption (IBSC) scheme using bilinear pairing for IIoT deployment. Besides, two hard problems are studied, called as, modified bilinear Diffie–Hellman inversion (MBDHI) assumption and modified bilinear strong Diffie–Hellman (MBSDH) assumption. The rigorous security analysis demonstrates that our IBSC scheme for IIoT is provably secure based on the intractability of decisional-MBDHI and MBSDH assumptions under formal security model without considering the concept of the random oracle. The performance comparison with other signcryption schemes shows satisfactory results. Thus, our IBSC scheme is appropriate for IIoT crowdsourcing environments, and also applicable for low-bandwidth communications.	algorithmic efficiency;bilinear filtering;cma-es;cloud computing;computation;computer data storage;confidentiality;crowdsourcing;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;identity creation;industrial pc;internet of things;outsourcing;overhead (computing);pervasive informatics;provable security;random oracle;server (computing);signcryption;software deployment;virtual private server	Arijit Karati;SK Hafizul Islam;G.

103eb55b5f5f220d6b63c3a6c3c8fe8ad34b0fff	trusted accounting in peer-to-peer environments: a novel token-based accounting scheme for autonomous distributed systems		Communication systems based on the peer-to-peer (p2p) paradigm present what is likely the most important development in Internet technology in recent years. In spite of the position of p2p systems as the largest source of traffic on the Internet, their commercial success is still limited. The basic tenets of p2p systems are cooperation among peers and completely decentralised communication. However, these can result in nontransparent actions, as well as opportunistic behaviour of the individual peers. Thus, the implementation of commercial p2p applications requires basic mechanisms to record transactions in the systems, i.e. the resource and service consumption, which will be used for charging, incentives, and control. These basic functionalities can be achieved by an accounting system that ideally should be fully distributed in keeping with the p2p spirit of such a system. Furthermore, it needs to be trustworthy so that the system cannot be misused by individual peers or groups of peers for gaining an undue advantage. Therefore, linking distributed accounting with distributed trustworthiness and distributed collaboration control presents a crucial challenge for the advancement of p2p systems. This dissertation researches this challenge by demonstrating the feasibility of fully distributed, trusted accounting in p2p systems with intrinsic automatic cooperation control by presenting and evaluating the token-based accounting scheme. The token-based accounting scheme’s framework introduces tokens as a combination of permission objects and receipts. Permission objects grant to peers the right to consume services and resources. When a peer consumes them, it “spends” tokens, and tokens becomes receipts which contain accounting information about the transaction. This process implements effective accounting with intrinsic cooperation control. The token-based accounting scheme’s system architecture is composed of four building blocks: Token structure, transaction protocols, token aggregation, and detection of double spending. The token structure ensures the authentication and integrity of accounting information, as well as the non-repudiation of transactions. The trustworthy transaction protocol introduces a novel transaction procedure that removes the benefits of defrauding the transaction partner but does not require the use of a third trusted party. Token aggregation swaps foreign tokens for new own tokens using a truly decentralised trustworthy process. With this process, a quorum of peers establishes a novel distributed basis of trust for p2p systems. This is achieved by applying threshold cryptography in combination with proactive secret sharing and with novel mechanisms that ensure the random selection of the quorum peers. The quorum size affects the scheme’s trustworthiness and is determined using a stochastic model. Efficient detection of double spending is enabled by introducing aggregation accounts that store issuing and usage information about tokens. Aggregation accounts are located at third party peers, called account holder sets. Maintenance operations performed on the account holder sets prevent loss of data and ensure consistency of aggregation accounts. Aggregation accounts are protected against attacks and fraud attempts by concealing their location using a novel overlay routing mechanism. By using simulations for several churn scenarios, the required account holder set size is determined. These simulations prove the token-based accounting scheme’s efficiency and the robustness of the storage mechanisms. The token-based accounting scheme was simulated in detail by varying the relevant parameters, i.e., quorum size, account holder set size, churn, and system size. The simulation results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the novel token-based accounting scheme. Its applicability is shown in two application scenarios.	aggregate data;application server;authentication;authorization;autonomous robot;care-of address;client (computing);client–server model;content delivery network;cryptography;data logger;digital distribution;distributed computing;double-spending;electronic billing;entity;foreign function interface;interconnection;internet;mutual authentication;non-repudiation;object composition;peer-to-peer;peering;proxy server;requirement;routing;scalability;secret sharing;server (computing);service-level agreement;simulation;social network aggregation;systems architecture;transaction processing;trust (emotion);trustworthy computing	Nicolas Christopher Liebau	2008				Security	-45.76463625592703	70.75589466074699	195841

With the proposed schemes, encryption keys of the ordered programs can be distributed to the authorized subscribers efficiently and securely. In these schemes, for key updates, at most two messages are transmitted and simpler computation functions, including one-way hash function and XOR operation, are used to reduce the computation cost compared to existing solutions. With our key distribution schemes, only the authorized subscribers can decrypt the ordered programs. Thus, the service provider in a Pay-TV system can charge his subscribers according to their subscriptions and the intelligent property rights of TV programs can be protected by the proposed schemes.	authorization;computation;cryptographic hash function;encryption;exclusive or;key distribution;one-way function	Yu-Lun Huang;Shiuh-Pyng Shieh;Jian-Chyuan Wang	2000		10.1109/CMPSAC.2000.884782	service provider;property rights;digital television;computer science;cryptography;network security;database;authorization;internet privacy;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Security	-42.24691560407092	70.55393040481957	195870
f3c0cb8d6dc90226d9e5cb7b939ba6a87d9e5edd	extended proxy-assisted approach: achieving revocable fine-grained encryption of cloud data		Attribute-based encryption has the potential to be deployed in a cloud computing environment to provide scalable and fine-grained data sharing. However, user revocation within ABE deployment remains a challenging issue to overcome, particularly when there is a large number of users. In this work, we introduce an extended proxy-assisted approach, which weakens the trust required of the cloud server. Based on an all-or-nothing principle, our approach is designed to discourage a cloud server from colluding with a third party to hinder the user revocation functionality. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by presenting a construction of the proposed approach, designed to provide efficient cloud data sharing and user revocation. A prototype was then implemented to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed construction.	attribute-based encryption;cloud computing;prototype;scalability;server (computing);software deployment;virtual private server	Yanjiang Yang;Joseph K.

4d157d1bf5777b446a99e9024e95c971e0fc3b57	clb-ecc: certificateless blind signature using ecc		Certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) is a new benchmark in modern cryptography. It not only simplifies the certificate management problem of PKC, but also avoids the key escrow problem of the identity based cryptosystem (ID-PKC). In this article, we propose a certificateless blind signature protocol which is based on elliptic curve cryptography (CLB-ECC). The scheme is suitable for the wireless communication environment because of smaller parameter size. The proposed scheme is proven to be secure against attacks by two different kinds of adversaries. CLB-ECC is efficient in terms of computation compared to the other existing conventional schemes. CLB-ECC can withstand forgery attack, key only attack, and known message attack. An e-cash framework, which is based on CLB-ECC, has also been proposed. As a result, the proposed CLB-ECC scheme seems to be more effective for applying to real life applications like e-shopping, e-voting, etc., in handheld devices.	adversary (cryptography);algorithmic efficiency;benchmark (computing);blind signature;computation;cryptosystem;digital signature;e-commerce;ecc memory;electronic funds transfer;elliptic curve cryptography;key escrow;mobile device;online shopping;pkc (conference);public-key cryptography;real life;requirement	Sanjeet Kumar Nayak;Sujata Mohanty;Banshidhar Majhi	2017	JIPS	10.3745/JIPS.03.0029	theoretical computer science;computer science;computer network;blind signature	Security	-44.77407901847505	73.9469220962022	196128

Proper signature schemes, based on discrete logarithms, must be used in order to guarantee the above requirements as well as selective disclosure of information. In this paper, we highlight that whenever a concrete architecture based on the above protocols is implemented, some aspects concerning how to manage the association between bases of discrete logarithms and attributes used in attribute certificates should be carefully considered, in order to guarantee that unlinkability really holds. We show that the problem is concrete by testing that the state-of-the-art implementation suffers from the above problem.

This is sufficient to shake the confidence of the customer in e-commerce. Authenticating the user on insecure communication channel like internet is an essential primitive and is target of various attacks. Therefore, remote user authentication is one of the most essential requirement for ensuring secure communication in today’s ubiquitous computing environment. Smart card-based authentication provide multi-factor authentication for accessing web-based applications. In this paper, an efficient password-based remote user authentication scheme using smart card is proposed. The proposed scheme is an improvement of the scheme proposed by Hsiang and Shih in 2009. Proposed scheme is secure against all well known security attacks and has a low computational cost. The security of the proposed protocol depends upon two security parameters which makes difficult for an attacker to launch attacks on the proposed scheme. Moreover, the user and the server agree on the common session key. Afterwards, all the subsequent messages between the user and the server are encrypted with this session key. Therefore, the attacker cannot get any meaningful authentication information from eavesdropping even in insecure communication channel.		Sandeep K.

However, it is hard to establish trust relations among anonymously acting business partners. Anonymous reputation systems have been proposed to mitigate this problem. Schiffner et al. recently proved that there is a conflict between anonymity and reputation and they established the non-existence of certain privacy-preserving reputation functions. In this paper we argue that this relationship is even more intricate. First, we present a reputation function that deanonymizes the user, yet provides strong anonymity (SA) according to their definitions. However, this reputation function has no utility, i.e., the submitted ratings have no influence on the resulting reputation values. Second, we show that a reputation function having utility requires the system to choose new independently at random selected pseudonyms (for all users it has utility for) on every new rating as a necessary condition to provide strong anonymity according to the aforementioned definition. Since some persistence of pseudonyms is favorable, we present a more secure, but also more usable definition for anonymous reputation systems that allows persistency yet guaranties k-anonymity. We further present a definition for rating secrecy based on a threshold. Finally, we propose a practical reputation function, for which we prove that it satisfies these definitions.	anonymous blog;electronic business;forward secrecy;persistence (computer science);pseudonymity;purchasing;reputation system	Sebastian Clauß;Stefan Schiffner;Florian Kerschbaum	2013		10.1145/2484313.2484361	e-commerce;reputation;computer science;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-43.50032110091979	71.34214103597574	196855

Keystroke Dynamics systems so far only accept passwords that are typed completely correct, i.e. without any corrections during the typing. The reason for this is that corrections during the typing result in missing features in the collected Keystroke Dynamics information. In this paper we will show however that the performance of the keystroke dynamics system is not influenced if indeed corrections are allowed during the typing of a password. We have investigated various solutions to handle these missing features and investigated how much the performance de-creases. We found that we can handle these missing features without any loss of performance, meaning that the algorithmic performance of the system does not decrease. In fact when allowing corrections, the system performance will highly increase due to the fact that there are no failures to capture.	algorithm;authentication;de-identification;event (computing);keystroke dynamics;password;user (computing)	Patrick Bours;Vathsala Komanpally	2014	2nd International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics	10.1109/IWBF.2014.6914257	cognitive password;s/key;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-44.57925944252908	69.57252008793232	197499

First, the scope of the mechanisms is deened: we mark out the class of authentication systems that were considered during the design of the mechanisms. A rst mechanism, based on proxies and a synchronization protocol , allows for a transparant protocol conversion. It is generic, and can easily be tailored to diierent speciic situations. The second mechanism addresses the problem of the statefulness of the protocol convertor. It can be used to oooad state from the convertor to the principals of the interconnected domains, thus making the convertor more robust. Both mechanisms can be used separately or in combination. When properly combined, they provide for a robust, transparant, and safe protocol convertor for authentication and key distribution protocols.	authentication protocol;gw-basic;integrated windows authentication;inter-domain;key distribution;message authentication code;proxy server;requirement;robustness (computer science);state (computer science);synchronization (computer science)	Frank Piessens;Bart De Decker;Phil Janson	1993		10.1109/RISP.1993.287642	otway–rees protocol;universal composability;computer science;information security;authentication protocol;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.83370199165711	71.55301235689855	197818

In most of these studies, there is no comprehensive and systematical metric available for schemes to be assessed objectively, and the authors present new schemes with assertions of the superior aspects over previous ones, while overlooking dimensions on which their schemes fare poorly. Unsurprisingly, most of them are far from satisfactory—either are found short of important security goals or lack of critical properties, especially being stuck with the security-usability tension. To overcome this issue, in this work we first explicitly define a security model that can accurately capture the practical capabilities of an adversary and then suggest a broad set of twelve properties framed as a systematic methodology for comparative evaluation, allowing schemes to be rated across a common spectrum. As our main contribution, a new scheme is advanced to resolve the various issues arising from user corruption and server compromise, and it is formally proved secure under the harshest adversary model so far. In particular, by integrating “honeywords”, traditionally the purview of system security, with a “fuzzy-verifier”, our scheme hits “two birds”: it not only eliminates the long-standing security-usability conflict that is considered intractable in the literature, but also achieves security guarantees beyond the conventional optimal security bound.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;multi-factor authentication;password;server (computing);smart card;usability	Ding Wang;Ping Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2016.2605087	real-time computing;computer security model;access control;distributed computing;adversary model;computer science;multi-factor authentication;adversary;challenge–response authentication;compromise;authentication	Security	-45.23372045774551	72.53318895248675	198044

In order to reduce implementation complexity and achieve computation efficiency, design issues for efficient and secure biometrics-based remote user authentication scheme have been extensively investigated by research community in these years. Recently, two biometrics-based authentication schemes using smart cards are introduced by Li and Hwang and Li et al., respectively. Li and Hwang proposed an efficient biometrics-based remote user authentication scheme using smart card and Li et al. proposed an improvement. The authors of both schemes claimed that their protocols deliver the important security features and system functionalities, such as without synchronized clock, freely changes password, mutual authentication, as well as low computation costs. However, these two schemes still have much space for security enhancement. In this paper, we first demonstrate a series of vulnerabilities on these two schemes. Then, an enhanced scheme with corresponding remedies is proposed to eliminate all identified security flaws in both schemes.	authentication protocol;biometrics;computation;cryptanalysis;id-wsf;key exchange;mutual authentication;password;replay attack;secure communication;server (computing);smart card;vulnerability (computing)	Jian-Zhu Lu;Shaoyuan Zhang;Shijie Qie	2011	2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)		data authentication algorithm;challenge–response authentication;computer science;access control;authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;network access control;world wide web;computer security	Security	-46.136696347033364	73.9027121212781	198972
